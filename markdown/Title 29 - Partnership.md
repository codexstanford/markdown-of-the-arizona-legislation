The profits and losses of a limited partnership shall be allocated among the partners, and among classes of partners, in the manner provided in writing in the partnership agreement. If the partnership agreement does not so provide in writing, profits and losses shall be allocated on the basis of the value as stated in the partnership records required to be kept pursuant to section 29-305 of the contributions made by each partner to the extent they have been received by the partnership and have not been returned.

#### Section 29-330. Sharing of distributions

Distributions of cash or other assets of a limited partnership shall be allocated among the partners, and among classes of partners, in the manner provided in writing in the partnership agreement. If the partnership agreement does not so provide in writing, distributions shall be made on the basis of the value as stated in the partnership records required to be kept pursuant to section 29-305 of the contributions made by each partner to the extent they have been received by the partnership and have not been returned.

### Article 6 - Distributions and Withdrawal

#### Section 29-331. Interim distributions

Except as provided in this article, a partner is entitled to receive distributions from a limited partnership before his withdrawal from the limited partnership and before the dissolution and winding up thereof to the extent and at the times or upon the happening of the events specified in the partnership agreement.

#### Section 29-332. Withdrawal of general partner

A general partner may withdraw from a limited partnership at any time by giving written notice to the other partners, but if the withdrawal violates the partnership agreement, the limited partnership may recover from the withdrawing general partner damages for breach of the partnership agreement and offset the damages against the amount otherwise distributable to him. The withdrawal of a general partner who is also a limited partner does not constitute withdrawal of the partner as a limited partner or affect the partner’s rights as a limited partner.

#### Section 29-333. Withdrawal of limited partner

A limited partner may withdraw from a limited partnership at the time or upon the happening of events specified in writing in the partnership agreement. If the agreement does not specify in writing the time or the events upon the happening of which a limited partner may withdraw or a definite time for the dissolution and winding up of the limited partnership, a limited partner may withdraw upon not less than six months' prior written notice to each general partner at his address on the books of the limited partnership at its office in this state.

#### Section 29-334. Distribution on withdrawal

A. On the withdrawal of a limited partner, except as otherwise provided in writing in the partnership agreement, the withdrawn limited partner and his personal representatives, successors and assigns do not have the right to receive any distribution by reason of withdrawal, but have only the rights of an assignee of the withdrawn limited partner's interest in the partnership to receive distributions with respect to the limited partner's interest during any continuation and during and on completion of any winding up of the limited partnership, less any damages recoverable against the withdrawn partner if the withdrawal violated the provisions of the partnership agreement.

B. If a general partner withdraws and within ninety days thereafter the limited partnership dissolves and commences to wind up its business, except as otherwise provided in a partnership agreement, the withdrawn general partner and the partner's personal representatives, successors and assigns do not have the right to receive any distribution by reason of the withdrawal but only have the rights of an assignee of the withdrawn general partner's interest in the limited partnership to receive distributions with respect to the general partner's interest during any continuation of the business of the partnership and during and on completion of winding up. If the event of withdrawal violated the partnership agreement, any damages recoverable from the withdrawn general partner shall be subtracted from this distribution.

C. If a general partner withdraws and within ninety days thereafter the limited partnership has not dissolved and commenced winding up of the partnership business, except as otherwise provided in writing in the partnership agreement, the partnership shall cause the withdrawn general partner's interest, if any, in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price equal to the amount that would have been distributable to the withdrawn general partner under section 29-1077, subsection B if, on the date of withdrawal, the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the continuing services of any of the partners and the partnership was wound up as of that date, with interest payable from the date of withdrawal to the date of payment. Except as may be provided in writing in the partnership agreement, payment of this buyout price is subject to the following terms:

1. Damages for wrongful withdrawal and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the withdrawn general partner to the partnership shall be offset against the buyout price. Interest on these damages shall be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the date of payment.

2. A partnership shall indemnify a withdrawn general partner whose interest is being purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the withdrawal, except:

(a) Liabilities incurred by an act of the withdrawn general partner under section 29-1062.

(b) Liabilities for which the partner was not liable pursuant to section 29-215 or 29-1026.

3. If no agreement for the purchase of a withdrawn general partner's interest is reached within one hundred twenty days after a written demand for payment, the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash to the withdrawn general partner the amount, if any, the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under paragraph 1.

4. If a deferred payment is authorized under paragraph 6, the partnership may tender, in lieu of payment under paragraph 3, a written offer to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under paragraph 1, stating the terms of payment, the amount and type of security for payment and the other terms and conditions of the obligation.

5. The payment or tender required by paragraph 3 or 4 shall be accompanied by the following:

(a) A written statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of withdrawal.

(b) The latest available partnership balance sheet and income statement, if any.

(c) A written explanation of how the estimated amount of payment was calculated.

(d) Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless within one hundred twenty days after the written notice the withdrawn general partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under paragraph 1 or other terms of the obligation to purchase.

6. A general partner who wrongfully withdraws before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause material hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment shall bear interest and shall be adequately secured by partnership assets if and to the extent reasonably practicable.

7. A withdrawn general partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to section 29-1035, subsection B, paragraph 2, subdivision (b), to determine the buyout price of that partner's interest, any offsets under paragraph 1 or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days after the partnership tenders payment or an offer to pay or within one year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the withdrawn general partner's interest, any offset due under paragraph 1 and accrued interest and shall enter a judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under paragraph 4, the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership's failure to tender payment or an offer to pay in compliance with paragraph 3 or 4.

#### Section 29-335. Distribution in kind

Except as provided in writing in the partnership agreement, a partner, regardless of the nature of his contribution, has no right to demand and receive any distribution from a limited partnership in any form other than cash. Except as provided in writing in the partnership agreement, a partner may not be compelled to accept a distribution of any asset in kind from a limited partnership to the extent that the percentage of the asset distributed to him exceeds a percentage of that asset which is equal to the percentage in which he shares in distributions from the limited partnership.

#### Section 29-336. Right to distribution

At the time a partner becomes entitled to receive a distribution, he has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited partnership with respect to the distribution.

#### Section 29-337. Limitations on distribution; treatment as income

A. A partner may not receive a distribution from a limited partnership to the extent that, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the limited partnership, other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests, exceed the fair value of the partnership assets.

B. Except as otherwise provided in the partnership agreement or the trust instrument, a distribution to a partner that is a charitable remainder trust as defined in section 664(d) of the internal revenue code is income for the purposes of title 14, chapter 7, article 4 to the extent that the value of the partnership interest after distribution is equal to or greater than its value at the date of contribution of the partnership interest to the charitable remainder trust. In this section, "internal revenue code" has the same meaning prescribed in section 43-105.

#### Section 29-338. Liability on return of contribution

A. If a partner has received the return of any part of his contribution without violation of the partnership agreement or this chapter, he is liable to the limited partnership for a period of one year thereafter for the amount of the returned contribution, but only to the extent necessary to discharge the limited partnership's liabilities to creditors who extended credit to the limited partnership during the period the contribution was held by the partnership.

B. If a partner has received the return of any part of his contribution in violation of the partnership agreement or this chapter, he is liable to the limited partnership for a period of six years thereafter for the amount of the contribution wrongfully returned.

C. A partner receives a return of his contribution to the extent that a distribution to him reduces his share of the fair value of the net assets of the limited partnership below the value as set forth in the partnership records required to be kept pursuant to section 29-305 of his contribution which has not been distributed to him.

### Article 7 - Assignment of Partnership Interests

#### Section 29-339. Nature of partnership interest

A partnership interest is personal property.

#### Section 29-340. Assignment of partnership interest

Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest is assignable in whole or in part. An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any rights of a partner. An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all his partnership interest.

#### Section 29-341. Rights of judgment creditor

On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner, the court may charge the partnership interest of the partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of the partner's partnership interest. This chapter does not deprive any partner of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to his partnership interest. This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's interest in the partnership.

#### Section 29-342. Right of assignee to become limited partner

A. An assignee of a partnership interest, including an assignee of a general partner, may become a limited partner if and to the extent that:

1. The assignor gives the assignee that right in accordance with authority described in the partnership agreement; or

2. All other partners consent.

B. An assignee who has become a limited partner has, to the extent assigned, the rights and powers and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities of a limited partner under the partnership agreement and this chapter. An assignee who becomes a limited partner also is liable for the obligations of his assignor to make and return contributions as provided in articles 5 and 6 of this chapter. However, the assignee is not obligated for liabilities unknown to the assignee at the time he became a limited partner.

C. If an assignee of a partnership interest becomes a limited partner, the assignor is not released from his liability to the limited partnership under sections 29-314 and 29-328.

#### Section 29-343. Power of estate of deceased or incompetent partner

If a partner who is an individual dies or a court of competent jurisdiction adjudges him to be incompetent to manage his person or his property the partner's executor, administrator guardian, conservator or other legal representative may exercise all the partner's rights for the purpose of settling his estate or administering his property, including any power the partner had to give an assignee the right to become a limited partner. If a partner is a corporation, trust or other entity and is dissolved or terminated, the powers of that partner may be exercised by its legal representative or successor.

### Article 8 - Dissolution

#### Section 29-344. Nonjudicial dissolution

A limited partnership is dissolved and its affairs shall be wound up upon the happening of the first to occur of the following:

1. At the time, if any, specified in the certificate of limited partnership.

2. Upon the happening of events specified in writing in the partnership agreement.

3. Written consent of all partners.

4. An event of withdrawal of a general partner if there is no remaining general partner unless all the limited partners, or a lesser number or percentage of limited partners specified in the partnership agreement, agree to the continuation of the business of the limited partnership and to the appointment of one or more additional general partners within ninety days after the event of withdrawal, or such greater period as may be specified in the partnership agreement.

5. Entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under section 29-345.

#### Section 29-345. Judicial dissolution

On application by or for a partner or assignee or any other successor in interest of a partner, the superior court may decree dissolution of a limited partnership whenever it is not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in conformity with the partnership agreement.

#### Section 29-346. Winding up

Except as provided in the partnership agreement, the general partners who have not wrongfully dissolved a limited partnership or, if none, the limited partners may wind up the limited partnership's affairs, but the superior court may wind up the limited partnership's affairs upon application of any partner, his legal representative or assignee.

#### Section 29-347. Distribution of assets

Upon the winding up of a limited partnership, the assets shall be distributed as follows:

1. To creditors, including partners who are creditors, to the extent permitted by law, in satisfaction of liabilities of the limited partnership other than liabilities for distributions to partners under section 29-331 or 29-334;

2. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, to partners and former partners in satisfaction of liabilities for distributions under section 29-331 or 29-334; and

3. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, to partners first for the return of their contributions and secondly respecting their partnership interests, in the proportions in which the partners share in distributions.

#### Section 29-353. Cancellation of registration

A foreign limited partnership may cancel its registration by filing with the secretary of state a certificate of cancellation signed and sworn to by a general partner. A cancellation does not terminate the authority of the secretary of state to accept service of process on the foreign limited partnership with respect to causes of action arising out of the transactions of business in this state.

#### Section 29-354. Transaction of business without registration

A. A foreign limited partnership transacting business in this state may not maintain any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state until it has registered in this state.

#### Section 29-364. Application to existing limited partnership; definition

A. For purposes of this chapter a limited partnership formed under any prior statute of this state and in existence on July 24, 1982 is deemed an existing limited partnership. An existing limited partnership and its partners are governed by this chapter and have the same rights and are subject to the same limitations, restrictions and liabilities as a limited partnership formed under this chapter and its partners, except as follows:

1. The partners of an existing limited partnership are not required to execute and file a certificate of limited partnership under this chapter in order to maintain continued existence as a limited partnership under this chapter. As used in this chapter with respect to an existing limited partnership, unless the context otherwise requires, "certificate of limited partnership" means the certificate of limited partnership executed and filed or recorded pursuant to the statute under which such limited partnership was formed, and the certificate as amended or restated.

2. The provisions of this chapter relating to the events requiring, and the method of effecting, an amendment or cancellation of a certificate of limited partnership apply to an existing limited partnership to the same extent and in the same way such provisions apply to a limited partnership formed under this chapter, except that the first amendment of the certificate of limited partnership of an existing limited partnership made after July 24, 1982 shall be effected by the execution and filing of a certificate of amendment setting forth all of the information specified in section 29-308, subsection A. Such information shall be current as of the date of the filing of the certificate of amendment which may be in the form of a restated certificate of limited partnership. The execution and filing of such certificate of amendment shall not result in the dissolution or in any way adversely affect the continued existence of the existing limited partnership.

3. An existing limited partnership is not subject to section 29-302, paragraph 1 or 3 with respect to its name as set forth in its certificate of limited partnership on July 24, 1982, but it becomes subject to such provisions if, and at the time, any change in its name is made after July 24, 1982, except that the addition of the words "limited partnership" to an existing limited partnership's name is not, for the purpose of this section, deemed a change of name.

4. An existing limited partnership is not subject to section 29-304, paragraph 2 until the execution and filing with the secretary of state of the certificate of amendment referred to in paragraph 2 of this subsection, at which time the general partners of an existing limited partnership shall have the obligation, and the right and power, to appoint and thereafter continuously maintain an agent for service of process as required by section 29-304, paragraph 2.

5. The references in this chapter to the date of the filing of a limited partnership's original certificate of limited partnership mean, with respect to an existing limited partnership, the date on which the existing limited partnership's original certificate of limited partnership was filed or recorded pursuant to the statute under which it was formed.

6. A certificate of amendment, a restated certificate of limited partnership or a certificate of cancellation with respect to an existing limited partnership, in addition to setting forth the information specified in section 29-309, subsection A, section 29-309, subsection F or section 29-310, shall state the place where the original certificate of limited partnership was filed or recorded.

7. Sections 29-327, 29-328 and 29-338 apply only to contributions and distributions made after July 24, 1982.

8. Section 29-342 applies only to assignments made after July 24, 1982.

9. Unless otherwise agreed to by the partners, the applicable provisions of prior statutes governing allocation of profits and losses rather than section 29-329, distributions to a withdrawing partner rather than section 29-334 and distributions of assets on the winding up of a limited partnership rather than section 29-347 govern limited partnerships formed before July 24, 1982.

B. From and after July 24, 1982, all amendments to, restatements or any cancellation of the certificate of limited partnership of an existing limited partnership shall be filed with the secretary of state and no such amendment, restatement or cancellation shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder of any county of this state.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, on or before December 31, 1984, every existing limited partnership shall execute and file with the secretary of state a certificate of amendment which conforms to the requirements of subsection A, paragraphs 2, 4 and 6 of this section. Failure to execute and file such an amendment shall not result in the dissolution or in any way adversely affect the continued existence of the existing limited partnership. However, such existing limited partnership may not maintain any action, suit or proceeding in any court of this state after December 31, 1984, until such an amendment has been filed.

#### Section 29-365. Effect of enactment on accrued rights

The enactment of this chapter does not affect any right accrued or established or any liability or penalty incurred under any prior statute relating to limited partnerships.

#### Section 29-366. Fees

The secretary of state shall charge and collect in advance and deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund the following fees:

B. If the obligations incurred before the transaction by a domestic limited partnership that is a party to or otherwise undertakes the transaction are not to be satisfied out of the property of the post-transaction entity pursuant to the plan, the general partners of that partnership immediately before the effective date of the transaction shall contribute the amount necessary to satisfy that  partnership's obligations to the post-transaction entity in the manner provided in section 29-1077, as if that partnership were dissolved.

C. A partner of a domestic limited partnership that is a party to or otherwise undertakes a transaction who does not become a partner or other interest holder of the post-transaction entity is dissociated, as provided in section 29-1051, from the domestic limited partnership of which that partner was a partner, as of the date the transaction takes effect.

If the dissociated partner was a general partner before the transaction, the post-transaction entity is bound under section 29-1062 by an act of a general partner dissociated under this subsection and the partner is liable under section 29-1063 for transactions entered into by the post-transaction entity after the transaction takes effect.

D. A person authorized by this chapter to file a statement may amend or cancel the statement by filing an amendment or cancellation that names the partnership, identifies the statement and states the substance of the amendment or cancellation.

#### Section 29-1012. Formation of partnership

B. An association formed under a statute other than this chapter, a predecessor statute or a comparable statute of another jurisdiction is not a partnership under this chapter.

C. In determining whether a partnership is formed, the following rules apply:

1. Joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entireties, joint property, common property or part ownership does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the co-owners share profits made by the use of the property, except that the ownership establishes a partnership if the persons have declared in a written partnership agreement that the property is partnership property subject to the provisions of the partnership agreement and this chapter.

2. The sharing of gross returns does not by itself establish a partnership, even if the persons sharing them have a joint or common right or interest in property from which the returns are derived.

3. A person who receives a share of the profits of a business is presumed to be a partner in the business, unless the profits were received in payment either:

(a) Of a debt by installments or otherwise.

Property is presumed to be partnership property if it is purchased with partnership assets, even if it is not acquired in the name of the partnership or of one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person's capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership.

D. Property acquired in the name of one or more of the partners, without an indication in the instrument transferring title to the property of the person's capacity as a partner or of the existence of a partnership and without use of partnership assets, is presumed to be separate property, even if used for partnership purposes.

### Article 3 - Relations of Partners to Persons Dealing with Partnership

#### Section 29-1021. Partner agent of partnership

Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority under section 29-1023:

1. Each partner is an agent of the partnership for the purpose of its business. An act of a partner, including the execution of an instrument in the partnership name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership, unless the partner had no authority to act for the partnership in the particular matter and the person with whom the partner was dealing knew or had received a notification that the partner lacked authority.

2. An act of a partner that is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the partnership business or business of the kind carried on by the partnership binds the partnership only if the act was authorized by the other partners.

#### Section 29-1022. Transfer of partnership property

A. Partnership property may be transferred as follows:

1. Subject to the effect of a statement of partnership authority under section 29-1023, partnership property held in the name of the partnership may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by a partner in the partnership name.

2. Partnership property held in the name of one or more partners with an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, but without an indication of the name of the partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.

3. Partnership property held in the name of one or more persons other than the partnership, without an indication in the instrument transferring the property to them of their capacity as partners or of the existence of a partnership, may be transferred by an instrument of transfer executed by the persons in whose name the property is held.

B. A partnership may recover partnership property from a transferee only if it proves that execution of the instrument of initial transfer did not bind the partnership under section 29-1021 and either:

1. As to a subsequent transferee who gave value for property transferred under subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section, proves that the subsequent transferee knew or had received a notification that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.

2. As to a transferee who gave value for property transferred under subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section, proves that the transferee knew or had received a notification that the property was partnership property and that the person who executed the instrument of initial transfer lacked authority to bind the partnership.

C. A partnership shall not recover partnership property from a subsequent transferee if the partnership would not have been entitled to recover the property, under subsection B of this section, from any earlier transferee of the property.

D. If a person holds all of the partners' interests in the partnership, all of the partnership property vests in that person. The person may execute a document in the name of the partnership to evidence vesting of the property in that person and may file or record the document.

#### Section 29-1023. Statement of partnership authority

A. A partnership may file a statement of partnership authority that:

1. Shall include:

(a) The name of the partnership.

(b) The street address of its chief executive office and of one office in this state, if there is one.

(c) The names and mailing addresses of all of the partners or of an agent appointed and maintained by the partnership for the purpose of subsection B of this section.

(d) The names of the partners authorized to execute an instrument transferring real property held in the name of the partnership.

2. May state the authority, or limitations on the authority, of some or all of the partners to enter into other transactions on behalf of the partnership and any other matter.

B. If a statement of partnership authority names an agent, the agent shall maintain a list of the names and mailing addresses of all of the partners and shall make it available to any person on request for good cause shown.

C. If a filed statement of partnership authority is executed pursuant to section 29-1005, subsection C and states the name of the partnership but does not contain all of the other information required by subsection A of this section, the statement nevertheless operates with respect to a person who is not a partner as provided in subsections D and E of this section.

D. Except as otherwise provided in subsection G of this section, a filed statement of partnership authority supplements the authority of a partner to enter into transactions on behalf of the partnership as follows:

1. Except for transfers of real property, a grant of authority contained in a filed statement of partnership authority is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, as long as and to the extent that a limitation on that authority is not then contained in another filed statement. A filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.

2. A grant of authority to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership contained in a certified copy of a filed statement of partnership authority recorded in the office for recording transfers of that real property is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge to the contrary, as long as and to the extent that a certified copy of a filed statement containing a limitation on that authority is not then of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property. The recording in the office for recording transfers of that real property of a certified copy of a filed cancellation of a limitation on authority revives the previous grant of authority.

E. A person who is not a partner is deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner to transfer real property held in the name of the partnership if a certified copy of the filed statement containing the limitation on authority is of record in the office for recording transfers of that real property.

F. Except as otherwise provided in subsections D and E of this section and sections 29-1064 and 29-1075, a person who is not a partner is not deemed to know of a limitation on the authority of a partner merely because the limitation is contained in a filed statement.

G. Unless earlier canceled, a filed statement of partnership authority is canceled by operation of law five years after the date on which the statement, or the most recent amendment, was filed with the secretary of state.

#### Section 29-1024. Statement of denial

A partner or any other person named as a partner in a filed statement of partnership authority or in a list maintained by an agent pursuant to section 29-1023, subsection B may file a statement of denial stating the name of the partnership and the fact that is being denied, including denial of a person's authority or status as a partner. A statement of denial is a limitation on authority as provided in section 29-1023, subsections D and E.

#### Section 29-1025. Partnership liable for partner's actionable conduct

A. A partnership is liable for loss or injury caused to a person, or for a penalty incurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a partner acting in the ordinary course of business of the partnership or with authority of the partnership.

B. If, in the course of the partnership's business or while acting with authority of the partnership, a partner receives or causes the partnership to receive money or property of a person who is not a partner, and the money or property is misapplied by a partner, the partnership is liable for the loss.

#### Section 29-1026. Partner's liability

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsections B, C and D of this section, all partners are liable jointly and severally for all obligations of the partnership unless otherwise agreed by the claimant or provided by law.

B. A person admitted as a partner into an existing partnership is not personally liable for any partnership obligation incurred before the person's admission as a partner.

C. Obligations incurred by a partnership or a limited partnership while the partnership or limited partnership is a limited liability partnership, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, are solely the obligations of the limited liability partnership. A partner is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, including by way of contribution or indemnification, for such obligations of the limited liability partnership incurred during the time the partnership or limited partnership is a limited liability partnership solely by reason of being or acting as such a partner. Notwithstanding contrary provisions in a partnership agreement existing prior to the effective date of a statement of qualification, the filing of a statement pursuant to section 29-1101 creates a presumption that the partners have agreed to the applicability of this subsection.

D. If a limited partnership is a limited liability partnership, this section applies to its general partners and to any of its limited partners who, under the provisions of chapter 3 of this title, are liable for the debts or obligations of the partnership.

E. Failure to observe the entity formalities otherwise applicable to the conduct or management of the business of the limited liability partnership is not a ground for imposing personal liability on any partner for the acts or debts of the limited liability partnership.

F. A partner may not receive a distribution from a limited liability partnership to the extent the distribution constitutes a transfer in violation of title 44, chapter 8.

#### Section 29-1027. Actions by and against partnership and partners

A. A partnership may sue and be sued in the name of the partnership.

B. Except as otherwise provided in subsection F of this section, an action may be brought against the partnership and any or all of the partners in the same action or in separate actions.

C. A judgment against a partnership is not by itself a judgment against a partner. A judgment against a partnership may not be satisfied from a partner's assets unless there is also a judgment against the partner.

D. A judgment creditor of a partner may not levy execution against the assets of the partner to satisfy a judgment based on a claim against the partnership unless either:

1. The claim is for a debt, obligation or liability for which the partner is liable as provided in section 29-1026 and either:

(a) A judgment based on the same claim has been obtained against the partnership and a writ of execution on the judgment has been returned unsatisfied in whole or in part.

(b) The partnership is a debtor in bankruptcy.

(c) The partner has agreed that the creditor need not exhaust partnership assets.

(d) A court grants permission to the judgment creditor to levy execution against the assets of a partner based on a finding that partnership assets subject to execution are clearly insufficient to satisfy the judgment, that exhaustion of partnership assets is excessively burdensome or that the grant of permission is an appropriate exercise of the court's equitable powers.

2. Liability is imposed on the partner by law or contract independent of the existence of the partnership.

E. This section applies to any partnership liability or obligation resulting from a representation by a partner or purported partner under section 29-1028.

F. A partner is not a proper party to an action against a limited liability partnership where that partner would not be personally liable for the claim under section 29-1026.

#### Section 29-1028. Liability of purported partner

A. If a person, by words or conduct, purports to be a partner, or consents to being represented by another as a partner, in a partnership or with one or more persons who are not partners, the purported partner is liable to a person to whom the representation is made, if that person, relying on the representation, enters into a transaction with the actual or purported partnership. If the representation, either by the purported partner or by a person with the purported partner's consent, is made in a public manner, the purported partner is liable to a person who relies on the purported partnership even if the purported partner is not aware of being held out as a partner to the claimant. If partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability as if the purported partner were a partner. If no partnership liability results, the purported partner is liable with respect to that liability jointly and severally with any other person consenting to the representation.

B. If a person pursuant to subsection A is represented to be a partner in an existing partnership, or with one or more persons who are not partners, the purported partner is an agent of persons consenting to the representation to bind them to the same extent and in the same manner as if the purported partner were a partner, with respect to persons who enter into transactions in reliance on the representation. If all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, a partnership act or partnership obligation results. If fewer than all of the partners of the existing partnership consent to the representation, the person acting and the partners consenting to the representation are jointly and severally liable.

C. A person is not liable as a partner merely because the person is named by another in a statement of partnership authority.

D. A person does not continue to be liable as a partner merely because of a failure to file a statement of dissociation or to amend a statement of partnership authority to indicate the partner's dissociation from the partnership.

E. Except as otherwise provided in subsections A and B, persons who are not partners as to each other are not liable as partners to other persons.

### Article 4 - Relations of Partners to Each Other and to Partnership

#### Section 29-1031. Partner's rights and duties

A. Each partner is deemed to have an account that is both:

A partnership may impose a reasonable charge, covering the costs of labor and material, for copies of documents furnished.

C. Each partner and the partnership shall furnish to a partner, and to the legal representative of a deceased partner or partner under legal disability:

B. A partner's duty of loyalty to the partnership and the other partners is limited to the following:

1. To account to the partnership and hold as trustee for it any property, profit or benefit derived by the partner in the conduct and winding up of the partnership business or derived from a use by the partner of partnership property, including the appropriation of a partnership opportunity.

D. A partner shall discharge the duties to the partnership and the other partners under this chapter or under the partnership agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.

C. The accrual of, and any time limitation on, a right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by other law. A right to an accounting on a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim barred by law.

#### Section 29-1036. Continuation of partnership beyond definite term or particular undertaking

A. If a partnership for a definite term or particular undertaking is continued, without an express agreement, after the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, the rights and duties of the partners remain the same as they were at the expiration or completion, as far as is consistent with a partnership at will.

B. If the partners, or those of them who habitually acted in the business during the term or undertaking, continue the business without any settlement or liquidation of the partnership, they are presumed to have agreed that the partnership continue.

### Article 5 - Transferees and Creditors of Partner

#### Section 29-1041. Partner not co-owner of partnership property

A partner is not a co-owner of partnership property and has no interest in partnership property that can be transferred, either voluntarily or involuntarily.

#### Section 29-1042. Partner's transferable interest in partnership

The only transferable interest of a partner in the partnership is the partner's share of the profits and losses of the partnership and the partner's right to receive distributions. The interest is personal property.

#### Section 29-1043. Transfer of partner's transferable interest

A. A transfer, in whole or in part, of a partner's transferable interest in the partnership:

1. Is permissible.

2. Does not by itself cause the partner's dissociation or a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business.

3. Does not, as against the other partners or the partnership, entitle the transferee, during the continuance of the partnership, to participate in the management or conduct of the partnership business, to require access to information concerning partnership transactions or to inspect or copy the partnership books or records.

B. A transferee of a partner's transferable interest in the partnership has a right to:

1. Receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled.

2. Receive on the dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, in accordance with the transfer, the net amount otherwise distributable to the transferor.

3. Seek under section 29-1071, paragraph 6 a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership business.

4. Exercise the rights under section 29-1071, paragraph 7.

C. In a dissolution and winding up, a transferee is entitled to an account of partnership transactions only from the date of the latest account agreed to by all of the partners.

D. On transfer, the transferor retains the rights and duties of a partner other than the interest in distributions transferred.

E. A partnership need not give effect to a transferee's rights under this section until it has notice of the transfer.

F. A transfer of a partner's transferable interest in the partnership in violation of a restriction on transfer contained in the partnership agreement is ineffective as to a person having notice of the restriction at the time of transfer.

#### Section 29-1044. Partner's transferable interest subject to charging order

A. On application by a judgment creditor of a partner or of a partner's transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the transferable interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor in respect of the partnership and may make all other orders, directions, accounts and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or that the circumstances of the case may require.

B. A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's transferable interest in the partnership. The court may order a foreclosure of the interest subject to the charging order at any time. The purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee.

C. At any time before foreclosure, an interest charged may be redeemed either:

1. By the judgment debtor.

2. With property other than partnership property, by one or more of the other partners.

3. With partnership property, by one or more of the other partners with the consent of all of the partners whose interests are not so charged.

D. This chapter does not deprive a partner of a right under exemption laws with respect to the partner's interest in the partnership.

E. This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a partner or partner's transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's transferable interest in the partnership.

### Article 7 - Partner's Dissociation When Business Not Wound Up

#### Section 29-1061. Purchase of dissociated partner's interest

A. If a partner is dissociated from a partnership without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business under section 29-1071, the partnership shall cause the dissociated partner's interest, if any, in the partnership to be purchased for a buyout price determined pursuant to subsection B of this section.

B. The buyout price of a dissociated partner's interest is the amount that would have been distributable to the dissociating partner under section 29-1077, subsection B if, on the date of dissociation, the assets of the partnership were sold at a price equal to the greater of the liquidation value or the value based on a sale of the entire business as a going concern without the continuing services of any of the partners and the partnership were wound up as of that date. Interest shall be paid from the date of dissociation to the date of payment.

C. Damages for wrongful dissociation under section 29-1052, subsection B, and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the dissociated partner to the partnership, shall be offset against the buyout price. Interest shall be paid from the date the amount owed becomes due to the date of payment.

D. A partnership shall indemnify a dissociated partner whose interest is being purchased against all partnership liabilities, whether incurred before or after the dissociation, except liabilities incurred by an act of the dissociated partner under section 29-1062.

E. If no agreement for the purchase of a dissociated partner's interest is reached within one hundred twenty days after a written demand for payment, the partnership shall pay, or cause to be paid, in cash to the dissociated partner the amount, if any, the partnership estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets and accrued interest under subsection C of this section.

F. If a deferred payment is authorized under subsection H of this section, the partnership may tender a written offer to pay the amount it estimates to be the buyout price and accrued interest, reduced by any offsets under subsection C of this section, stating the time of payment, the amount and type of security for payment and the other terms and conditions of the obligation.

G. The payment or tender required by subsection E or F of this section shall be accompanied by the following:

1. A written statement of partnership assets and liabilities as of the date of dissociation.

2. The latest available partnership balance sheet and income statement, if any.

3. A written explanation of how the estimated amount of the payment was calculated.

4. Written notice that the payment is in full satisfaction of the obligation to purchase unless, within one hundred twenty days after the written notice, the dissociated partner commences an action to determine the buyout price, any offsets under subsection C of this section or other terms of the obligation to purchase.

H. A partner who wrongfully dissociates before the expiration of a definite term or the completion of a particular undertaking is not entitled to payment of any portion of the buyout price until the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, unless the partner establishes to the satisfaction of the court that earlier payment will not cause material hardship to the business of the partnership. A deferred payment shall bear interest and shall be adequately secured by partnership assets if and to the extent reasonably practicable.

I. A dissociated partner may maintain an action against the partnership, pursuant to section 29-1035, subsection B, paragraph 2, subdivision (b), to determine the buyout price of that partner's interest, any offsets under subsection C of this section or other terms of the obligation to purchase. The action shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days after the partnership tenders payment or an offer to pay or within one year after written demand for payment if no payment or offer to pay is tendered. The court shall determine the buyout price of the dissociated partner's interest, any offset due under subsection C of this section and accrued interest and shall enter judgment for any additional payment or refund. If deferred payment is authorized under subsection H of this section, the court shall also determine the security for payment and other terms of the obligation to purchase. The court may assess reasonable attorney fees and the fees and expenses of appraisers or other experts for a party to the action, in amounts the court finds equitable, against a party that the court finds acted arbitrarily, vexatiously or not in good faith. The finding may be based on the partnership's failure to tender payment or an offer to pay or to comply with subsection G of this section.

#### Section 29-1062. Dissociated partner's power to bind and liability to partnership

A. For two years after a partner dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business, the partnership, including a surviving partnership under article 9 of this chapter, is bound by an act of the dissociated partner that would have bound the partnership under section 29-1021 before dissociation only if at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:

1. Reasonably believed that the dissociated partner was then a partner.

2. Did not have notice of the partner's dissociation.

3. Is not deemed to have had knowledge under section 29-1023, subsection E or notice under section 29-1064, subsection C.

B. A dissociated partner is liable to the partnership for any damage caused to the partnership arising from an obligation incurred by the dissociated partner after dissociation for which the partnership is liable under subsection A of this section.

#### Section 29-1063. Dissociated partner's liability to other persons

A. A partner's dissociation does not of itself discharge the partner's liability for a partnership obligation incurred before dissociation. A dissociated partner is not liable for a partnership obligation incurred after dissociation, except as otherwise provided in subsection B of this section.

B. A partner who dissociates without resulting in a dissolution and winding up of the partnership business is liable as a partner to the other party in a transaction entered into by the partnership, or a surviving partnership pursuant to any merger permitted by law, within two years after the partner's dissociation, only if the partner is liable for the obligation under section 29-1026 and at the time of entering into the transaction the other party:

1. Relied on a reasonable belief that the dissociated partner was then a partner.

2. Did not have notice of the partner's dissociation.

3. Is not deemed to have had knowledge under section 29-1023, subsection E or notice under section 29-1064, subsection C.

C. By agreement with the partnership creditor and the partners continuing the business, a dissociated partner may be released from liability for a partnership obligation.

D. A dissociated partner is released from liability for a partnership obligation if a partnership creditor, with notice of the partner's dissociation but without the partner's consent, agrees to a material alteration in the nature or time of payment of a partnership obligation.

#### Section 29-1064. Statement of dissociation

A. A dissociated partner or the partnership may file a statement of dissociation stating the name of the partnership and that the partner is dissociated from the partnership.

B. A statement of dissociation is a limitation on the authority of a dissociated partner for the purposes of section 29-1023, subsections D and E.

C. For the purposes of section 29-1062, subsection A, paragraph 3 and section 29-1063, subsection B, paragraph 3, a person who is not a partner is deemed to have notice of the dissociation ninety days after the statement of dissociation is filed.

#### Section 29-1065. Continued use of partnership name

Continued use of a partnership name, or a dissociated partner's name as part of a partnership name, by partners continuing the business does not of itself make the dissociated partner liable for an obligation of the partners or the partnership continuing the business.

### Article 8 - Winding Up Partnership Business

#### Section 29-1071. Events causing dissolution and winding up of partnership business

A partnership is dissolved, and its business shall be wound up, only on the occurrence of any of the following events:

1. In a partnership at will, the partnership having notice from a partner, other than a partner who is dissociated under section 29-1051, paragraphs 2 through 10, of that partner's express will to withdraw as a partner, or on a later date specified by the partner.

2. In a partnership for a definite term or particular undertaking either:

(a) Within ninety days after a partner's dissociation by death or otherwise under section 29-1051, paragraphs 6 through 10 or wrongful dissociation under section 29-1052, subsection B, the express will of at least half of the remaining partners to wind up the partnership business. A partner's rightful dissociation pursuant to section 29-1052, subsection B, paragraph 2, subdivision (a) constitutes the expression of that partner's will to wind up the partnership business.

(b) The express will of all of the partners to wind up the partnership business.

(c) After the expiration of the term, at the election of any partner by written notice to the partnership, or on the completion of the undertaking.

3. An event agreed to in the partnership agreement resulting in the winding up of the partnership business.

4. An event that makes it unlawful for all or substantially all of the business of the partnership to be continued, but a cure of illegality within ninety days after notice to the partnership of the event is effective retroactively to the date of the event for purposes of this section.

5. On application by a partner, a judicial determination that either:

(a) The economic purpose of the partnership is likely to be unreasonably frustrated.

(b) Another partner has engaged in conduct relating to the partnership business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business in partnership with that partner.

(c) It is not otherwise reasonably practicable to carry on the partnership business in conformity with the partnership agreement.

6. On application by a transferee of a partner's transferable interest, a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the partnership business either:

(a) After the expiration of the term or completion of the undertaking, if the partnership was for a definite term or particular undertaking at the time of the transfer or entry of the charging order that gave rise to the transfer.

(b) At any time, if the partnership was a partnership at will at the time of the transfer or entry of the charging order that gave rise to the transfer.

7. The expiration of ninety days after a partner's dissociation that results in one or no remaining partner, unless the dissociation was pursuant to section 29-1051, paragraph 6 or 7 and before the expiration, all of the transferees, including transferees of the dissociated partner, and the remaining partner, if any, agree by written consent to continue the business of the partnership and admit that number of partners sufficient to cause the partnership to have at least two partners.

#### Section 29-1072. Partnership continues after dissolution

A. Subject to subsection B of this section, a partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. The partnership is terminated when the winding up of its business is completed. If the partnership is a limited liability partnership, its status as a limited liability partnership continues until termination.

B. At any time after the dissolution of a partnership and before the winding up of its business is completed, all of the partners, including any dissociating partner other than a wrongfully dissociating partner, may waive the right to have the partnership's business wound up and the partnership terminated. In that event both:

1. The partnership resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred, and any liability incurred by the partnership or a partner after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if dissolution had never occurred.

2. The rights of a third party accruing under section 29-1074, paragraph 1 or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver are not adversely affected.

#### Section 29-1073. Right to wind up partnership business

A. After dissolution, a partner who has not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up the partnership's business, but on application of any partner, partner's legal representative or transferee, the superior court, for good cause shown, may order judicial supervision of the winding up.

B. The legal representative of the last surviving partner may wind up a partnership's business.

C. A person winding up a partnership's business may preserve the partnership business or property as a going concern for a reasonable time, prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal or administrative, settle and close the partnership's business, dispose of and transfer the partnership's property, discharge the partnership's liabilities, distribute the assets of the partnership pursuant to section 29-1077, settle disputes by mediation, arbitration or otherwise and perform other necessary acts.

#### Section 29-1074. Partner's power to bind partnership after dissolution

Subject to section 29-1075, a partnership is bound by a partner's act after dissolution that either:

1. Is appropriate for winding up the partnership business.

2. Would have bound the partnership under section 29-1021 before dissolution, if the other party to the transaction did not have notice of the dissolution.

#### Section 29-1075. Statement of dissolution

A. After dissolution, a partner who has not wrongfully dissociated may file a statement of dissolution stating the name of the partnership and that the partnership has dissolved and is winding up its business.

B. A statement of dissolution cancels a filed statement of partnership authority for the purposes of section 29-1023, subsection D and is a limitation on authority for the purposes of section 29-1023, subsection E.

C. For the purposes of sections 29-1021 and 29-1074, a person who is not a partner is deemed to have notice of the dissolution and the limitation on the partners' authority as a result of the statement of dissolution ninety days after it is filed.

D. After filing and, if appropriate, recording a statement of dissolution, a dissolved partnership may file and, if appropriate, record a statement of partnership authority that operates with respect to a person who is not a partner as provided in section 29-1023, subsections D and E in any transaction, whether or not the transaction is appropriate for winding up the partnership business.

E. In order for a partnership to file a statement of dissolution where that partnership has not previously filed a statement of partnership authority with the secretary of state, the partnership must first file a statement of partnership authority with the secretary of state pursuant to section 29-1023.  The secretary of state shall not accept any statement of dissolution for which a statement of partnership authority has not first been filed with the secretary of state.

 

#### Section 29-1076. Partner's liability to other partners after dissolution

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection B of this section or in section 29-1026, after dissolution a partner is liable to the other partners for the partner's share of any partnership liability incurred under section 29-1074.

B. A partner who, with knowledge of the dissolution, incurs a partnership liability under section 29-1074, paragraph 2 by an act that is not appropriate for winding up the partnership business is liable to the partnership for any damage caused to the partnership arising from the liability.

#### Section 29-1077. Settlement of accounts and contributions among partners

A. In winding up a partnership's business, the assets of the partnership, including the contributions of the partners required by this section, shall be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including, to the extent permitted by law, partners who are creditors. Any surplus shall be applied to pay in cash the net amount distributable to partners in accordance with their right to distributions under subsection B of this section.

B. Each partner is entitled to a settlement of all partnership accounts on winding up the partnership business. In settling accounts among the partners, the profits and losses during the period of winding up, including those profits and losses that result from the liquidation of the partnership assets, shall be credited and charged to the partners' accounts. The partnership shall make a distribution to a partner in an amount equal to any excess of the credits over the charges in the partner's account. A partner shall contribute to the partnership an amount equal to any excess of the charges over the credits in the partner's account except that in determining such excess, charges attributable to obligations for which the partner is personally liable under section 29-1026 shall not be considered. Damages for wrongful dissociation under section 29-1052, subsection B and all other amounts owing, whether or not presently due, from the partner to the partnership shall be offset against the amounts distributable to the partner and shall increase the amount that must be contributed by the partner pursuant to this section.

C. If a partner fails to contribute the full amount required under subsection B of this section, each of the other partners shall contribute, in the proportion in which the partner shares partnership losses, the additional amount necessary to satisfy any partnership obligations. A partner or partner's legal representative may recover from the other partners any contributions that the partner or legal representative makes to the extent the amount contributed exceeds that partner's share of the partnership obligations for which the partner is liable under section 29-1026.

D. After the settlement of accounts, each partner shall contribute, in the proportion in which the partner shares partnership losses, the amount necessary to satisfy partnership obligations or the amounts of obligations that were not known at the time of the settlement.

E. The estate of a deceased partner is liable for the partner's obligation to contribute to the partnership.

F. An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a partnership or a partner, or a person appointed by a court to represent creditors of a partnership or a partner, may enforce a partner's obligation to contribute to the partnership.

G. A person who was a partner at any time within ninety days before the commencement of winding up is a partner for the purposes of this section.

A. Except as provided in subsections B and C of this section, when a division becomes effective, each resulting entity is liable, jointly and severally, with the other resulting entities for the obligations of the dividing entity that existed immediately before the effectiveness of the division, and all those obligations of the dividing entity are automatically obligations of each resulting entity without assignment, assumption or delegation.

B. A resulting entity is not liable for an obligation of the dividing entity if and to the extent any of the following applies:

1. The obligee has consented in writing to the obligations being allocated to, or continuing to be the obligation of, one or more of the other resulting entities and the plan of division states that the obligation is being allocated to, or will continue to be the obligation of, those entities, or those entities have otherwise expressly assumed the obligation.

2. A court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction or a governmental agency having jurisdiction as to the matter has issued an order, finding, rule, regulation or other ruling that has become final and nonappealable and in which the obligation is deemed to be allocated to, or to continue to be the obligation of, one or more of the other resulting entities.

3. Recourse regarding the obligation is, by contract or by law, limited to an asset of one or more of the other resulting entities.

4. Recourse regarding the obligation is, by contract or by law, limited to one or more of the other resulting entities.

C. A resulting entity may enter into agreements or other arrangements for purposes of mitigating risks associated with the entity's liability for an obligation of the dividing entity. The agreements or arrangements may be entered into with one or more of the other resulting entities or with third parties. The agreements or arrangements may include indemnification, contribution, guaranty, insurance, offset, loan, investment and any other lawful means of dealing with the risks associated with the liability for the obligation.

D. Unless the obligee has otherwise agreed or consented, liens, security interests and other encumbrances on the property of the dividing entity are not impaired by the division, regardless of whether that property has become the property of a resulting entity that is not the dividing entity, regardless of whether the dividing entity is one of the resulting entities and regardless of any otherwise enforceable allocation of obligations of the dividing entity.

E. If the dividing entity is bound by a security agreement governed by title 47, chapter 9 or its counterpart as enacted in any jurisdiction and the security agreement provides that the security interest attaches to after-acquired collateral, each resulting entity is bound by the security agreement unless the secured party has otherwise agreed or consented.

F. For purposes of and notwithstanding any provision of the governing statute of the dividing entity or any resulting entity, the division is deemed not to be a dividend or other distribution by the dividing entity or any resulting entity.

A. If a statement of division is filed with the appropriate filing authority but the division is not authorized by the law of the relevant foreign jurisdiction as required by section 29-2601, subsection B or C, the division is ineffective.

The amendment must change the name of the entity in accordance with the naming requirements of its governing statute and, if attached, is deemed to be delivered to the appropriate filing authority for filing.

### Article 3 - Relations of Members and Managers to Persons Dealing with Limited Liability Company

#### Section 29-3301. Agency power of member and manager

A. In a member-managed limited liability company, both of the following apply:

1. Each member is an agent of the company for the purpose of conducting the company's activities and affairs in the ordinary course.

2. The act of each member done in the ordinary course of the company's activities and affairs binds the company unless the acting member has in fact no authority to act for the company in the particular matter and the person with whom the member is dealing has knowledge of the fact that the member has no such authority.

B. In a manager-managed limited liability company, all of the following apply:

1. A member is not an agent of the company solely by reason of being a member except to the extent that authority has been delegated to the member by the manager or managers or by the provisions of an operating agreement.

2. Each manager is an agent of the company for the purpose of conducting the company's activities and affairs in the ordinary course.

3.

#### Section 29-3302. [Reserved]

 

 

 

#### Section 29-3303. [Reserved]

 

#### Section 29-3304. Liability of members and managers

A. A debt, obligation or other liability of a limited liability company is solely the debt, obligation or other liability of the company.  A member or manager is not personally liable, directly or indirectly, by way of contribution or otherwise, for a debt, obligation or other liability of the company or for the acts or omissions of any other member, manager, agent or employee of the company, solely by reason of being or acting as a member or manager. This subsection applies regardless of the dissolution of the company.

B. The failure of a limited liability company to observe formalities relating to the exercise of its powers or management of its activities and affairs is not a ground for imposing liability on a member or manager for a debt, obligation or other liability of the company.

### Article 4 - Relations of Members to Each Other and to Limited Liability Company

#### Section 29-3401. Becoming a member; transferable interest; ownership of interest in limited liability company

A. At the time of formation, a limited liability company must have at least one member. If a company is to have only one member on formation, the person becomes a member by agreeing to be a member and by being identified as the member in the articles of organization.  The member and the organizer may be, but are not required to be, different persons.  If the member and organizer are different persons, the organizer acts on behalf of the initial member.

B. If a limited liability company is to have more than one member on formation, those persons become members as agreed by the persons before the formation of the company.  The organizer acts on behalf of the persons in forming the company and may be, but is not required to be, one of the persons.

C. After formation of a limited liability company, a person becomes a member by any of the following:

1. As provided in the operating agreement.

2. As the result of a transaction effective under article 10 of this chapter.

3. By agreeing to become a member, with the affirmative vote or consent of all the members.

4. As provided in section 29-3701, subsection A, paragraph 3.

D. A person may become a member without either:

1. Acquiring a transferable interest.

2. Making or being obligated to make a contribution to the limited liability company.

E. A transferable interest may be held by two or more natural persons as joint tenants with right of survivorship or by a married couple as community property with right of survivorship.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, an assignment or issuance of a transferable interest to two or more natural persons creates a tenancy in common, except an assignment or issuance to a married couple.

F. A joint tenancy with right of survivorship is created when a written operating agreement expressly declares that two or more natural persons hold a transferable interest as joint tenants with right of survivorship or in joint tenancy with right of survivorship. A joint tenancy with right of survivorship may also be created by a written assignment of a transferable interest to two or more natural persons, who may include one or more assignors, or by the articles of organization, if the written assignment or the articles have been signed by each joint tenant and contain the express written declaration that the joint tenants hold the assigned transferable interest as joint tenants with right of survivorship or in joint tenancy with right of survivorship.

G. An estate in community property with right of survivorship is created when a written operating agreement expressly declares that a married couple holds a transferable interest as community property with right of survivorship.  An estate in community property with right of survivorship may also be created by a written assignment of a transferable interest to a married couple, who may include one or both assignor spouses, or by the articles of organization, if the written assignment or the articles have been signed by each spouse and contain the express written declaration that the married couple holds the assigned transferable interest as community property with right of survivorship.

H. All co-owners of a transferable interest held as joint tenants with right of survivorship, as community property or as community property with right of survivorship own an equal undivided interest in the transferable interest.  Each co-owner of a transferable interest, whether the transferable interest is held as tenants in common, joint tenants with right of survivorship, community property or community property with right of survivorship, shall have only the rights of a transferee with respect to the interest, both during the lifetime and following the death of any other co-owner, unless and until the co-owner becomes a member in accordance with subsection C of this section.

I. If a transferable interest is held by two or more persons in joint tenancy with right of survivorship or by a married couple as community property with right of survivorship, after the death of a co-owner of the transferable interest all of the following apply:

1. The surviving co-owner or co-owners of the transferable interest shall succeed to the ownership of the decedent's interest in the transferable interest without further action by the limited liability company or the other members and shall have only the rights of a transferee with respect to the interest, unless and until the co-owner or co-owners are admitted as a member or members in accordance with subsection C of this section.

2. The decedent's interest in the hands of the surviving co-owner or co-owners shall continue to be subject to all obligations and liabilities to which that interest was subject immediately before the death under the terms of the operating agreement or other agreement among one or more members or third parties.

3. If there is more than one surviving co-owner of a transferable interest held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, after the death of a co-owner the surviving co-owners shall continue to own the transferable interest in equal shares as joint tenants with right of survivorship.

J. The distribution, voting, approval and other management rights with respect to a transferable interest that is co-owned by two or more persons, whether the transferable interest is held as tenants in common, joint tenants with right of survivorship, community property or community property with right of survivorship, shall be the same as if the interest were held by only one person.

K. Each co-owner of a transferable interest who becomes a member may exercise all voting, approval and other management rights of a member, including the right to approve an amendment to the operating agreement, with respect to an interest held as tenancy in common, joint tenancy with right of survivorship, community property or community property with right of survivorship.

L. The limited liability company is entitled to rely in good faith on the act of a member that purports to be taken in the exercise of any voting, approval or other management right, including the right to approve an amendment to the operating agreement relating to a transferable interest that is co-owned by the member with one or more other persons, whether the transferable interest is held as tenants in common, joint tenants with right of survivorship, community property or community property with right of survivorship.

M. If a co-owner of a transferable interest held as joint tenants with right of survivorship or community property with right of survivorship transfers part or all of the co-owner's share of the transferable interest, the right of survivorship is extinguished and the co-owners of the transferable interest after the transfer hold their shares of the transferable interest as tenants in common.  In the case of community property with right of survivorship, the right of survivorship is also extinguished as provided in section 14-2803 or 14-2804 or on the delivery to the limited liability company, at its principal address, of an affidavit entitled "affidavit terminating right of survivorship" that is executed by either spouse under oath stating the spouse's intent to terminate the right of survivorship and describing the affected transferable interest.  The delivery of the affidavit does not extinguish the community property interest of either spouse.

N. A limited liability company is not required to give effect to any creation or extinguishment of a right of survivorship until the company has received written notice of the change in the form of ownership or of the creation or the extinguishment of a right of survivorship at its principal address.

O. With respect to a transferable interest owned in joint tenancy with right of survivorship, tenancy in common or community property with or without right of survivorship, if a charging order from a court of competent jurisdiction is obtained against a co-owner's share of the transferable interest, it shall attach only to that co-owner's share or portion of the transferable interest and not to the share or portion of the other co-owner or co-owners.

#### Section 29-3402. Form of contribution

A contribution may consist of property transferred to, services performed for or another benefit provided to the limited liability company or an agreement to transfer property to, perform services for or provide another benefit to the company.

#### Section 29-3403. Liability for contributions

A. A person's obligation to make a contribution to a limited liability company is not enforceable unless the obligation is set forth in a record signed by the person or as otherwise provided in section 29-3502, subsection H.  A person's obligation to make a contribution to the company is not excused by the person's death, disability, termination or other inability to perform personally.

B. If a person does not fulfill an obligation to make a contribution other than money, the person is obligated at the option of the limited liability company to contribute monies equal to the value of the part of the contribution that has not been made.

C. The obligation of a person to make a contribution may be compromised only by the affirmative vote or consent of all the members.  If a creditor of a limited liability company extends credit or otherwise acts in reliance on an obligation described in subsection A of this section without knowledge or notice of a compromise under this subsection, the creditor may enforce the obligation.

#### Section 29-3404. Sharing of and right to distributions before dissolution

A. Any distribution made by a limited liability company before its dissolution and winding up must be in equal shares among members and persons dissociated as members, except to the extent necessary to comply with a transfer effective under section 29-3502 or charging order in effect under section 29-3503.

B. A person has a right to a distribution before the dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company only if the company decides to make an interim distribution.  A person's dissociation does not entitle the person to a distribution.

C. A person does not have a right to demand or receive a distribution from a limited liability company in any form other than money.  Except as otherwise provided in section 29-3707, subsection D, a company may distribute an asset in kind only if each part of the asset is fungible with each other part and each person receives a percentage of the asset equal in value to the person's share of distributions.

D. If a member or transferee becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member or transferee has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited liability company with respect to the distribution.  However, the company's obligation to make a distribution is subject to offset for any amount owed to the company by the member or a person dissociated as a member on whose account the distribution is made.

#### Section 29-3405. Limitations on distributions

A. A limited liability company may not make a distribution, including a distribution under section 29-3707, if after the distribution either of the following applies:

1. The company would not be able to pay its debts as the debts become due in the ordinary course of the company's activities and affairs.

2. The company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities.

B. A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection A of this section on:

1. Financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances.

2. A fair valuation or other method that is reasonable under the circumstances.

C. Except as otherwise provided in subsection E of this section, the effect of a distribution under subsection A of this section is measured:

1. In the case of a distribution that is a redemption or other purchase by a limited liability company of a transferable interest or that is a transfer to a member in return for the member's relinquishment of any right to participate as a member in the management or conduct of the company's activities and affairs or to have access to records or other information concerning the company's activities and affairs, as of the earlier of either of the following:

(a) The date that money or other property is transferred or debt is incurred by the limited liability company.

(b) The date that the person entitled to the distribution ceases to own the interest or right being acquired by the company in return for the distribution.

2. In the case of any other distribution of indebtedness, as of the date the indebtedness is distributed.

3. In all other cases, as of the date of either of the following:

(a) The distribution is authorized, if the payment occurs not later than one hundred twenty days after that date.

(b) The payment is made, if the payment occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the distribution is authorized.

D. A limited liability company's indebtedness to a member or transferee incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the company's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.

E. A limited liability company's indebtedness, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not a liability for the purposes of subsection A of this section if the terms of the indebtedness provide that payment of principal and interest is made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made.

F. In measuring the effect of a distribution under section 29-3707, the liabilities of a dissolved limited liability company do not include any claim that has been disposed of under section 29-3704, 29-3705 or 29-3706.

#### Section 29-3406. Liability for improper distributions

A. A person that receives a distribution that violates section 29-3405 is personally liable to the limited liability company but only to the extent that the distribution received by the person exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid to that person under section 29-3405.

B. An action under this section is barred unless commenced not later than three years after the distribution.

#### Section 29-3407. Management of limited liability company

A. Management of a limited liability company is reserved to its members unless the articles of organization provide that the company is managed by one or more managers.

B. In a member-managed limited liability company, the following apply:

1. Except as expressly provided in this chapter, the management and conduct of the company are vested in the members.

2. Within the ordinary course of the company's activities and affairs, each member has the right to manage and conduct the company's activities and affairs.

3. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a majority in interest of the members shall decide any of the following:

(a) Matters that are outside the ordinary course of the company's activities and affairs but within the company's purpose.

(b) Matters on which there exists a known difference among members.

(c) Whether to make an interim distribution before dissolution and winding up.

(d) Whether to make an advance to a member or manager under section 29-3408, subsection C.

4. The affirmative vote or consent of all the members is required to do any of the following:

(a) Undertake, or authorize a member or other person to undertake, an act outside the scope of the company's purpose, as stated in the operating agreement, or that otherwise violates the operating agreement.

(b) Amend the operating agreement.

(c) Authorize an amendment to the articles of organization that changes the company from a member-managed limited liability company to a manager-managed limited liability company.

(d) Issue a transferable interest in the company to any person.

(e) Take any action requiring the approval of all members under this chapter.

C. In a manager-managed limited liability company, the following apply:

1. Except as expressly provided in this chapter, the right to manage the company is vested in the manager or managers.

2. Within the ordinary course of the company's activities and affairs, each manager has the right to manage and conduct the company's activities and affairs.

3. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a majority of the managers shall decide any of the following:

(a) Matters that are outside the ordinary course of the company's activities and affairs but within the company's purpose.

(b) Matters on which there exists a known difference among managers.

(c) Whether to make an interim distribution before dissolution and winding up.

(d) Whether to make an advance to a member or manager under section 29-3408, subsection C.

4. The affirmative vote or consent of all members is required to do any of the following:

(a) Undertake, or authorize a manager, member or other person to undertake, an act outside the scope of the company's purpose, as stated in the operating agreement, or that otherwise violates the operating agreement.

(b) Amend the operating agreement.

(c) Authorize an amendment to the articles of organization that changes the company from a manager-managed limited liability company to member-managed limited liability company.

(d) Issue a transferable interest in the limited liability company to any person.

(e) Take any action requiring the approval of all members under this chapter.

5. A manager may be chosen at any time by the affirmative vote or consent of a majority in interest of the members and remains a manager until a successor has been chosen, unless the manager at an earlier time resigns, is removed or dies or, in the case of a manager that is not an individual, terminates. A manager may be removed at any time by the affirmative vote or consent of a majority in interest of the members without notice or cause.

6. A person is not required to be a member to be a manager, but the dissociation of a member that is also a manager removes the person as a manager.  If a person that is both a manager and a member ceases to be a manager, that cessation does not by itself dissociate the person as a member.

7. A person's ceasing to be a manager does not discharge any debt, obligation or other liability to the limited liability company or members that the person incurred while a manager.

D. An action requiring the vote or consent of members or managers under this chapter may be taken without a meeting if the action is approved by the minimum number of members or managers required to approve the action.  A member may appoint a proxy or other agent to vote, consent or otherwise act for the member by signing an appointing record, personally or by the member's agent.

E. The dissolution of a limited liability company does not affect the applicability of this section.  However, a person that wrongfully causes dissolution of the company loses the right to participate in management as a member and a manager and that person may not be included in determining whether a majority in interest of the members or, in the case of a manager-managed limited liability company, a majority of the managers has voted for or consented to any matter or action.

F. A limited liability company shall reimburse a member for an advance to the company beyond the amount of capital the member agreed to contribute.

G. A member is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for a member-managed limited liability company except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the activities of the company.

#### Section 29-3408. Reimbursement; indemnification; advancement; insurance

A. A limited liability company shall reimburse a present or former member of a member-managed company or manager of a manager-managed company for any payment made by the member or manager in the course of the member's or manager's activities on behalf of the company if the member or manager complied with sections 29-3405, 29-3407 and 29-3409, in each case as modified by the operating agreement, in making the payment.

B. A limited liability company shall indemnify and hold harmless a person with respect to any claim or demand against the person and any debt, obligation or other liability incurred by the person by reason of the person's former or present capacity as a member or manager if the claim, demand, debt, obligation or other liability does not arise from the person's breach of the operating agreement or section 29-3405, 29-3407 or 29-3409, in each case as modified by the operating agreement.

C. A limited liability company may advance reasonable expenses, including attorney fees and costs, incurred by a person in connection with a claim or demand against the person by reason of the person's former or present capacity as a member or manager, but the person must repay the company if the person ultimately is determined not to be entitled to be indemnified under subsection B of this section.

D. A limited liability company may reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless a present or former member of a member-managed company or manager of a manager-managed company for any payment and with respect to any claim, demand, debt, obligation or other liability, except that the approval of all members, after disclosure of all material facts, is required to reimburse, indemnify or hold harmless a person with respect to any act, omission or transaction by the person that constitutes a violation of the operating agreement or section 29-3405, 29-3407 or 29-3409, in each case as modified by the operating agreement.

E. A limited liability company may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a member or manager against liability asserted against or incurred by the member or manager in that capacity or arising from that status even if, under section 29-3105, subsection C, paragraph 6, the operating agreement could not eliminate or limit the person's liability to the company for the conduct giving rise to the liability.

#### Section 29-3409. Standards of conduct for members and managers

A. A member of a member-managed limited liability company owes to the company and the other members the duties of loyalty and care stated in subsections B and C of this section.

C. The duty of care of a member of a member-managed limited liability company in the conduct or winding up of the company's activities and affairs is to refrain from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct or wilful or intentional misconduct.

D. A member shall discharge the duties and obligations under this chapter or under the operating agreement and exercise any right consistently with the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing.

E. A member does not violate a duty or obligation under this chapter or under the operating agreement solely because the member's conduct furthers the member's own interest.

F. All the members of a member-managed limited liability company may authorize or ratify, after disclosure of all material facts, a specific act, omission or transaction or specific category of acts, omissions or transactions that otherwise would violate the duty of loyalty, as expanded, limited or eliminated in the operating agreement.

G. It is a defense to a claim under subsection B, paragraph 2 or 4 of this section and any comparable claim in equity or at common law that the transaction or decision was fair to the limited liability company.

H. If, as allowed by subsection F or Q of this section or the operating agreement, a member enters into a transaction with the limited liability company that otherwise would be prohibited by subsection B, paragraph 2 of this section, the member's rights and obligations arising from the transaction are the same as those of a person that is not a member.

I. A manager of a manager-managed limited liability company owes to the company and the members the duties of loyalty and care stated in subsections J and K of this section.

J. The fiduciary duty of loyalty of a manager in a manager-managed limited liability company includes the following duties:

L. A manager shall discharge the duties and obligations under this chapter or under the operating agreement and exercise any right consistently with the contractual obligation of good faith and fair dealing.

Q. In a manager-managed limited liability company, a member does not have any fiduciary duty to the company or to any other member solely by reason of being a member.  Whether and the extent to which a member of a manager-managed limited liability company owes fiduciary duties to the company or the other members depends on the extent to which the member controls or participates in the management or the affairs of the company and shall be determined in accordance with the policies of this Section and laws other than this chapter.

R. A conflict of interest is material if the conflict would reasonably be expected to affect a member's or manager's judgment regarding the decision or transaction under consideration.

A transferable interest is personal property.

#### Section 29-3502. Transfer of transferable interest

(a) Participate in the management or conduct of the company's activities and affairs.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections B and C of this section, have access to records or other information concerning the company's activities and affairs.

C. In a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company, a transferee is entitled to an account of the company's transactions only from the date of dissolution.

D. A transferable interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the interest issued by a limited liability company in a record, and, subject to this section, the interest represented by the certificate may be transferred by a transfer of the certificate.  A company may not issue a certificate of the interest in bearer form.

E. A limited liability company is not required to give effect to a transferee's rights under this section until the company knows or has notice of the transfer.

F. A transfer of a transferable interest in violation of a restriction on transfer is ineffective if the intended transferee has knowledge or notice of the restriction at the time of the transfer or if the restriction is set forth in an operating agreement embodied in a signed record.

G. Except as otherwise provided in section 29-3602, paragraph 4, subdivision (b), if a member transfers a transferable interest, the transferor retains the rights of a member other than the transferable interest transferred and retains all the duties and obligations of a member.

H. If a member transfers a transferable interest to a person that becomes a member with respect to the transferred interest, the transferee is liable for the member's obligations under sections 29-3403 and 29-3406 that are known to the transferee when the transferee becomes a member or that are set forth in an operating agreement embodied in a signed record.

#### Section 29-3503. Charging order

A. On application by a judgment creditor of a member or transferee, a court may enter a charging order against the transferable interest of the judgment debtor for the unsatisfied amount of the judgment.

B. The member or transferee whose transferable interest is subject to a charging order under subsection A of this section may extinguish the charging order by satisfying the judgment and filing a certified copy of the satisfaction with the court that issued the charging order.

C. A limited liability company or one or more members whose transferable interests are not subject to the charging order may pay to the judgment creditor the full amount due under the judgment and thereby succeed to the rights of the judgment creditor, including the charging order.

D. This chapter does not deprive any member or transferee of the benefit of any exemption law applicable to the transferable interest of the member or transferee.
