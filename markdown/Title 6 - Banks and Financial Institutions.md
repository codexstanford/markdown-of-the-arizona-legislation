A. An association may maintain all types of deposit accounts and prescribe those terms and conditions relating to the accounts as are allowable for the association to maintain the insurance of its deposits by an insurance corporation.

B. Accounts are:

1. Withdrawable and subject to enforced retirement as provided in this article. This chapter does not prevent the withdrawal of funds from an association by negotiable or nonnegotiable order.

2. Entitled to dividends as provided in this article.

3. Nonassessable for either debts or losses of the association.

4. Issued on such plan or plans of payment and in such series or classes as the bylaws may provide, which plan or plans of payment may include:

(a) Regular installment plan with agreed weekly or monthly payments, with dividends credited to or in behalf of the account until the ultimate value agreed on in the subscription is reached.

(b) Full paid plan with one single payment of $100 per unit and dividends payable in cash unless by agreement credited to the account.

(c) Prepaid plan with one single payment in such amount per unit as is set forth in the bylaws and dividends credited to such account until the ultimate value of $100 per unit is reached.

(d) Optional plan with payments in such amount or amounts and at such times as the holder may elect and dividends credited to such account unless by agreement payable in cash.

(e) Any other plan of payment which the deputy director may approve as conforming to sound savings and loan practice.

#### Section 6-424. Shares of guaranty capital; nature; consideration

A. Shares of guaranty capital shall constitute a secondary reserve out of which losses shall be paid after all other available reserves have been exhausted, and such shares shall be:

1. Nonwithdrawable, except as provided in section 6-428, until all liabilities of the association have been satisfied in full, including payment of the withdrawal value of all accounts.

2. Entitled to dividends only as provided in section 6-442.

B. The consideration for the issuance of shares of guaranty capital may be paid to the association, or a wholly owned subsidiary of the association, in whole or in part, in cash, in other property, tangible or intangible, including promissory notes, or in labor or services actually performed for the association. Shares are deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable if payment of the consideration for which the shares are to be issued has been received by the association or a wholly owned subsidiary of the association. In the absence of bad faith in the valuation of the consideration, the judgment of the board of directors or the shareholders, as the case may be, as to the value of the consideration received for shares is conclusive.

#### Section 6-425. Shares of guaranty capital; authorization of issuance; minimum amount

A. An association may provide for the issuance of shares of guaranty capital, either by its original articles of incorporation or by an amendment to the articles of incorporation.

B. The aggregate initial guaranty capital of an association being organized under this chapter shall be not less than the minimum initial guaranty capital required under section 6-407.

C. In the case of an association that shall at any time be operating and its original articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of guaranty shares but the association has issued no guaranty shares, or in the case of an association already in operation that amends its articles to authorize the issuance of guaranty shares, the aggregate initial guaranty capital shall be not less than either:

1. The initial guaranty capital required under section 6-407.

2. An amount that, together with the amount of surplus and all reserves required or designated as available for losses, equals in the aggregate not less than the required capital and reserves necessary to obtain and maintain insurance of accounts by the insurance corporation, whichever is greater.

D. In the case of an association already in operation and having issued and outstanding guaranty shares, the aggregate guaranty capital shall be an amount not less than an amount that, together with the amount of surplus, amount of outstanding capital notes and debentures, and all reserves required or designated for use for losses, equals in the aggregate not less than the required capital and reserves necessary to obtain and maintain insurance of accounts by the insurance corporation.

E. Any plan for the issuance of shares of guaranty capital shall be subject to the approval of the deputy director as being in conformity with this chapter, and the rules and regulations of the deputy director pertaining thereto.

#### Section 6-426. Shares of guaranty capital; rights of existing shareholders

When an association already in operation amends its articles of incorporation to authorize the issuance of shares of guaranty capital, or when an association already in operation with provision in its original articles of incorporation for the issuance of guaranty shares but which has not issued any guaranty shares, proposes to issue such shares:

A. The association shall mail notice to each shareholder who was entitled to vote at the meeting at which the amendment was adopted, or, in the case of an association which is authorized by its original articles of incorporation to issue guaranty shares but has not issued any such shares, to each stockholder of the association on the date of the adoption of the resolution of the board of directors proposing to issue such shares, giving him the prior right for at least sixty days after the date of such notice, to subscribe to the initial issue of shares of guaranty capital, in the same proportion which the withdrawal value of such holder's account bears to the aggregate withdrawal value of all accounts in the association. Such rights to subscribe shall be transferable. No fraction of an original share of guaranty capital need be issued, but in such case fractional subscription rights may be combined to authorize the subscription to one or more whole share of guaranty capital. Fractional subscription rights need not be issued for an account the withdrawal value of which is less than ten dollars.

B. The board of directors shall determine, as of the day prior to the effective date of the amendment, or as of the date of the adoption of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such shares in case the original articles of incorporation provide for such shares, the total amount of loss reserves, undivided profits, and unallocated reserves after making allowances for accrued dividends and expenses, losses not provided for, and such similar items as are chargeable against the income of the association since the last previous apportionment date. The amount so fixed shall constitute a segregated surplus of the association and may be retained in, or allocated to, such reserve accounts, undivided profits accounts, or surplus accounts as may be lawful; and other earnings of the association accruing after the effective date may be allocated to said segregated surplus and an equal amount then may be transferred to any other unsegregated account.

C. Such segregated surplus shall be available for losses from the depreciation of securities or otherwise, except that any loss resulting from operations, including loans and investments made or purchased after the effective date of the amendment, or the date of the adoption of the resolution authorizing the issuance of such shares in case the original articles of incorporation so provide, shall be charged first to loss reserves and undivided profits created after such date until the same are exhausted.

D. If the association merges with another as provided in this chapter the balance of such segregated surplus shall continue to be held in a segregated account or accounts for the same use and disposition as though no merger had occurred.

E. If the association liquidates or effects a sale of all or substantially all of its assets within fifteen years from the effective date of the amendment authorizing the initial issuance of shares of guaranty capital, or from the date of the adoption of the resolution in case the original articles of incorporation provide for such shares, and each holder of the account on the day prior to such effective date who has continued to remain such a holder without interruption, or who has transferred his account from one type or class of account to another, or whose account has been retired by enforced retirement, shall be entitled to an amount, in addition to the withdrawal value of his account, in such proportion of the unused balance of the segregated surplus as he would have been entitled to had the association liquidated on the effective date of such amendment, or the date of the adoption of the resolution, as the case may be.

#### Section 6-427. Shares of guaranty capital; advertisement; sales; collection of subscription

A. All prospectae and advertising matter regarding the subscription for shares of guaranty capital shall include a statement to the effect that such shares of guaranty capital are not insured.

B. No association shall pay to any person any commission or other compensation for obtaining any subscription to or sale of shares of guaranty capital without the prior approval of the deputy director.

C. The board of directors shall establish a separate account to receive all funds paid in for shares of guaranty capital, and shall maintain such account until further action is authorized as follows:

1. When the aggregate amount of such funds equals or exceeds the amount of the minimum initial guaranty capital that the association must obtain, and either the board of directors has decided by resolution to proceed under the guaranty capital plan, or one year has elapsed after the date on which the issuance of shares of guaranty capital was authorized and the board has taken no action, then the separate account may be terminated and the funds may be transferred to the association's general account.

2. If the aggregate amount of such funds fails to reach the amount of the minimum initial guaranty capital that the association must obtain and one year has elapsed after the date on which the issuance of shares of guaranty capital was authorized or if the board of directors, within such one-year period, has decided by resolution to abandon the guaranty capital plan, the funds in the separate account shall be returned to the respective subscribers and shall not become a liability of the association or its officers or directors.

#### Section 6-428. Retirement or reduction of shares of guaranty capital

A. The board of directors of an association operating with guaranty capital may propose an amendment to the articles of incorporation providing for the retirement of all of the guaranty capital, and a detailed plan for effectuating such an amendment. The resulting capital of the association shall be not less than the minimum initial capital that the association, if it were being organized, would be required to have under this chapter concerning applicants and initial capital. The proposal shall be submitted to the deputy director for the deputy director's approval.

B. If the deputy director approves the proposal, the association's board of directors may request in writing an appraisal of the value of the shares of guaranty capital. The deputy director then shall cause such an appraisal to be made and receive therefor the fees for a special examination as provided by section 6-125, allowing proper credit to such shares from the association's segregated surplus, if any exists, and from other reserves and undivided profits. The value of the shares of guaranty capital so determined may be considered in the further proceedings under this section.

C. The proposal then may be submitted to the members at an annual or special meeting. The proposal shall be adopted on receiving in the affirmative the votes of the holders of two-thirds or more of the outstanding shares of guaranty capital, and also two-thirds or more of the total number of votes that all other members of the association are entitled to cast thereon. The proposal shall become effective on completion of the procedure provided in this chapter for the amendment of articles of incorporation.

D. An association may amend its articles of incorporation, in accordance with the procedure provided in this chapter for such amendments, to reduce its shares of guaranty capital, but in no event to an amount that is less than the minimum guaranty capital that the association would be required by this chapter to issue if it were newly authorized to issue guaranty capital.

#### Section 6-429. Issuance, delivery, and transfer of certificates and account books

A. An association may evidence an account by one or more appropriate certificates.

B. The holder of an account may transfer his rights in the account absolutely or conditionally to any other person eligible to hold the same by written assignment. Notwithstanding the effectiveness of such a transfer between the parties to the transfer, the association may treat the holder of record as the owner of the account for payment, voting and all other purposes until the assignment and any accompanying certificate or account books have been received by the association with a request for the transfer on the association's records.

C. Account certificates, account books and any other evidences of membership are negotiable or nonnegotiable and not subject to, but shares of guaranty capital certificates are subject to, the provisions of title 47, chapter 8.

D. All certificates and account books delivered to the holders as prescribed by this article are subject to garnishment, attachment and execution as provided by the laws of this state.

E. If the holder of an account, or the personal representative of any such person, files with the association an affidavit to the effect that his account book or certificate has been lost or destroyed, and that the account book or certificate has not been pledged or assigned either in whole or in part, then the association may issue a substitute account book or certificate in the name of the holder, with a statement that the account book or certificate is issued in lieu of the one lost or destroyed. The association is not liable thereafter with respect to the original account book or certificate, but the board of directors may require a bond in sufficient amount to indemnify the association against any loss which might result from the issuance of the substitute account book or certificate.

#### Section 6-430. Who may hold capital and membership

Accounts, shares of guaranty capital, and membership in an association may be held:

1. By any person in his own right, regardless of his age or marital status, or by two or more of such persons.

2. By a government or governmental instrumentality when authorized by law.

#### Section 6-432. Effect of payment to minor or fiduciary

A. Unless the written agreement provides otherwise, or unless the association has had written notice of the terms under which a fiduciary holds an account, the association may pay the value thereof and dividends thereon:

1. To any minor who is the holder of such account.

2. To such fiduciary who is the holder of such account without becoming liable to any beneficiary for such payment.

B. In each of the foregoing instances the receipt or acquittance of the person or persons to whom payment is made in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be a complete discharge of the association's obligation as to the amount so paid.

#### Section 6-433. Payment on disability or death of holder in his own right of account

A. If the holder in his own right of an account becomes a person with a disability and a conservator has been appointed, by a court of competent jurisdiction, and has qualified then the association may pay the value of such account and dividends thereon to the conservator. Until the association has actual knowledge that a conservator has been appointed, it may pay to the protected person personally and his receipt or acquittance therefor shall be a complete discharge of the association as to the amount so paid.

B. Upon the death of a holder in his own right of an account, the association, upon receipt of proper estate tax waivers, may pay the value thereof and dividends thereon:

1. To the personal representative of such deceased holder, if and when qualified, in the manner provided in this chapter for the voluntary withdrawal of account generally.

2. To the successor of such deceased holder upon presentation of an affidavit pursuant to section 14-3971.

 

#### Section 6-434. Shares and accounts of certain associations as legal investments; deposit of fiduciary monies

A. All accounts of a federal savings and loan association and all accounts of a savings and loan association operating under this chapter, whose accounts are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation, as provided in title IV of the national housing act, as now or hereafter amended, are legal investments for the funds of executors, administrators, guardians, receivers and trustees of every kind and nature and insurance companies, and such associations are qualified to act as trustee or custodian within the provisions of the federal self-employed individual's tax retirement act of 1962, as amended.

B. Monies held by a savings and loan association as fiduciary may be deposited to the credit of the savings and loan association on time or demand account with itself or with any bank or other savings and loan association the deposits of which are insured by instrumentalities of, or corporations chartered by, the United States for the purpose of insuring the accounts of banks or savings and loan associations. Unless otherwise provided by the writing creating the trust, if the monies are deposited with itself the savings and loan association shall secure the deposits with securities described in section 6-446, subsection A, paragraphs 1 and 2 or other security approved by the deputy director for such a purpose, in the amount of the deposit, less the amount by which the deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation or such other instrumentality of, or corporation chartered by, the United States as may be established for the purpose of insuring the accounts of savings and loan associations.

#### Section 6-435. Voluntary withdrawal of accounts

A. A holder of an account may make application for withdrawal of, and the association may pay, all or any part of the withdrawal value thereof at any time.

B. If the association has insufficient funds in the treasury and from current receipts to pay all matured accounts and applications for withdrawal within thirty days after such accounts mature or payment is requested, then the board of directors shall provide by resolution:

1. The amount of money available in each calendar month to pay maturities and withdrawals, in accordance with safe and required operating procedure, but after making provision for expenses, debts, obligations, and cash dividends on accounts, due or to become due, not less than fifty percent of the remainder of such treasury funds and current receipts shall be made available for the payment of withdrawals and maturities.

2. For a list of matured accounts in order of maturity, and if in the same series, in order of issuance in such series and also of applications for withdrawals in chronological order of filing. Separate lists may be established for such purposes, in which event the resolution shall provide the proportion of available money that shall be applied to each list.

3. For a maximum sum, that shall not exceed $1,000, that may be paid to any one holder at any one time and if any holder's application for withdrawal or for payment of matured shares exceeds the sum so fixed, then the holder shall be paid in turn the sum so fixed, and the holder's application, reduced by such payment, shall be deemed refiled in its order as if filed on the date of such payment. Such limited payment may be made on a fixed date in each month and such refiling and renumbering, as the case may be, may take place on the same date in each subsequent month as long as any applications remain unpaid.

4. For a maximum sum, that shall not exceed $200, which may be paid on any application for withdrawal or to any one holder of matured shares in any calendar month, regardless of the order of application.

C. Accounts pledged as sole security for a loan shall be subject to the withdrawal provisions of this section, but amounts available for payment on the application for withdrawal shall be applied first to the repayment of the loan balance.

D. Accounts may be accepted by the association in payment or part payment for any real estate or other assets owned by the association,  but if the association has a list of withdrawals, or withdrawals and maturities, such sale of assets shall be to the highest bidder, and at least ten days' notice of the proposed sale shall be given by mail to all holders of accounts whose names appear on the withdrawal or maturity list.

E. A holder shall not have more than one application for withdrawal in effect at any one time, but may cancel the application or reduce the amount thereof at any time as to any amount not yet paid.

F. The holder of accounts for which application for withdrawal has been made does not become a creditor by reason of such application.

G. The board of directors of any association operating on the serial plan or with regular installment or prepaid shares on which dividends have not been credited directly to the share accounts, may determine by resolution the portion of profits that may be paid to withdrawing members.

H. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a savings and loan association may offer payment order accounts, approved for federal associations doing business in this state, and authorizing withdrawals therefrom by written drafts payable to third parties, subject to conditions, limitations and restrictions as the deputy director may by rule prescribe.

#### Section 6-436. Maturity of shares

A. When a regular installment or prepaid share reaches maturity value by reason of payments or dividend credits, or both, all payments thereon by the holder shall cease. The association either shall pay to the holder the maturity value of such share, in accordance with the provisions of this article, or shall mail a notice to the holder at his last known address as it appears on the association's records, to the effect that he is entitled to receive payment for such share or to transfer the same or such portion thereof, as the directors may specify, into other accounts, and that if he takes neither action within sixty days after the date on which such notice is mailed, the value of such share may be held in a creditor account without interest or dividends, available for the holder upon his application, or the board of directors may transfer such share to another account of equivalent value on which dividends shall accrue as on a new account opened on the transfer date.

B. If the association has insufficient funds to make immediate payment upon the date of maturity of any shares, such shares shall be listed in the order of their respective dates of maturity, and shall be paid in the manner provided in section 6-435. Shares in the same series maturing on the same date shall be listed, as of such date, in the order in which they were issued in that series. From the date of maturity until payment, dividends shall be apportioned to such matured shares at a rate to be determined by resolution of the board of directors. Dividends so apportioned shall be accumulated to the credit of such shares and shall be paid to the holder at the time when the shares are paid, but the rate of such dividends shall not exceed the highest rate being currently apportioned to any other shares.

#### Section 6-437. Enforced retirement of accounts

A. The board of directors, when authorized by the by-laws, and in conformity with the provisions of this section and of the by-laws, may retire on any dividend payment date any accounts, which have not been pledged as security for loans, by enforcing the retirement thereof.

B. Thirty days' prior written notice of such enforced retirement shall be given to the holder of an account to be retired and the holder shall not be entitled to further dividends after the dividend payment date on which such account is to be retired, but such holder shall be paid the full withdrawal value of his account plus the dividend apportioned thereto as of the date fixed for retirement. All accounts upon which applications for voluntary withdrawal have been received, and all shares which have matured, shall be paid first in accordance with the provisions of this article.

#### Section 6-438. Authorized charges applicable to members

An association may charge initial membership fee and a fee for transfer of membership or capital, as may be authorized by the by-laws, but no such fee shall exceed twenty-five cents per share or per one hundred dollars of the account.

#### Section 6-439. Accounts subject to liens

Every account shall be subject to a lien for the payment of such charges as lawfully may accrue thereon under the provisions of this chapter, and the by-laws may prescribe the manner of enforcing such lien, but no member shall be responsible for any losses which the then existing assets of the association shall not be sufficient to satisfy, or for any unpaid installment upon his account which is not yet due under the terms of his subscription.

#### Section 6-440. Apportionment of profits

The board of directors may apportion the profits of the association as the bylaws may prescribe, and each apportionment shall be made in accordance with the following procedure:

1. Proper allocation first shall be made to accrued interest on accounts.

2. Proper allocation then shall be made to any reserves required by law or the deputy director.

3. Additional allocations then may be made to such special reserves as the board of directors may have established.

4. Dividends then may be declared if the bylaws so provide on shares of guaranty capital, in accordance with this chapter.

5. The residue of such profits may be held as undivided profits.

#### Section 6-442. Dividends and interest

A. Subject to the restrictions set forth in this section and the association's bylaws, an association from time to time may determine the term, rate and amount of interest to be paid on accounts, and for that purpose may establish reasonable classifications of accounts, based on any of the following:

1. The types or classes of such accounts.

2. The length of time accounts are continued in effect.

3. The size of initial payments on accounts.

4. The minimum balances of accounts during apportionment periods.

5. The frequency and extent of the activity of accounts.

6. Such other classifications as the deputy director may approve, and the deputy director is authorized to prepare model plans of classifications for adoption by associations.

B. An association shall determine the method of calculating the amount of interest on accounts, and the date on which the interest is to be declared or credited, but a payment or credit shall not be made more than ten days before the end of any apportionment period, except on a matured bonus plan account or as approved by rules of the deputy director.

C. Dividends may be declared and paid on shares of guaranty capital as allowed from time to time by the laws governing corporations organized in this state, except that dividends payable other than in the association's own stock may be paid out as a distribution, as defined in section 10-140, only with the approval of the deputy director or as approved by rules of the deputy director.

#### Section 6-443. Bonus plans

For the purpose of encouraging thrift, systematic savings and long-term investment, the board of directors may establish by resolution bonus plans for holders of accounts. The board then shall transfer from the periodical profits of the association additional amounts to a bonus reserve, from which reserve payments to holders complying with such plans shall be paid. Every bonus so paid shall be deemed a premium and shall not be construed as a dividend. The bonus plan adopted by the board of directors shall be either one prescribed by the regulations of the federal deposit insurance corporation or its successor instrumentality or shall be in accordance with the following provisions:

1. The holder shall agree to make regular payments at least monthly, of any predetermined amount, until the payments, together with dividends apportioned thereto, equal two hundred times the agreed monthly payment and without a delay of more than thirty days in any payment, without a prepayment of more than twelve months and without making application for withdrawal of all or any part of the account. At the end of the bonus period, the holder shall receive, in addition to the regular monthly payments and dividends apportioned thereto, a bonus at the rate of one per cent per annum computed on the withdrawal value of the account at each apportionment of profits. If the holder applies for withdrawal of his account in part or in full or fails to meet any and all the other terms of his bonus agreement after such account, including dividends apportioned thereto, has reached:

(a) At least fifty but less than one hundred times the agreed monthly payment upon his account in accordance with the terms thereof, such holder shall be entitled to receive one-fourth of the bonus allocable to such account.

(b) At least one hundred but less than one hundred fifty times the agreed monthly payment upon his account in accordance with the terms thereof, such holder shall be entitled to receive one-half of such bonus allocable to such account.

(c) At least one hundred fifty but less than two hundred times the agreed monthly payment upon his account in accordance with the terms thereof, such holder shall be entitled to receive three-fourths of such bonus allocable to such account.

2. The holder shall subscribe to a long-term investment plan providing that if he maintains in his account an agreed minimum balance either:

(a) For a period of four years, he shall be paid a bonus of one-half of one per cent per annum.

(b) For a period of eight years, he shall be paid a bonus of one per cent per annum.

 

The plan may state the minimum and maximum balances on which a bonus may be paid.

3. If the association effects an enforced retirement of an account which is under a bonus plan before the bonus becomes payable according to the plan, the portion of the bonus reserve allocable to the account shall be paid to the holder.

#### Section 6-444. Promotional activities prohibited; definitions

A. After the effective date hereof, an association shall not give for the opening of, or increasing the amount of, any account, any giveaway that has a monetary value in excess of the sum fixed for specified classes of accounts by rule of the deputy director. The monetary value of any giveaway so given shall be the cost of the giveaway to the association and the association shall keep in its records for a period of at least two years suitable evidence of such cost. If the giveaway is purchased or obtained by the association together with, in connection with, or at the same time as another item or other items from the same supplier, not identical therewith, such value shall be deemed to be the then current regular selling price or charge of the supplier on separate sales or dispositions thereof in the quantity included, and the association shall in such case obtain, and keep in its records for a period of at least two years, a signed statement by such supplier of such regular selling price or charge.

B. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Account" means shares of an association of whatsoever class or designation, accounts, share account, investment certificate, share subscription, and credit to the account of the maker thereof other than credit on account of a loan by the association.

2. "Give" means to give, to sell or dispose of for less than full monetary value as hereinbefore defined, or with any agreement or undertaking, contingent or otherwise, for repurchase or redemption, whether total or partial, or to offer, promise, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Any reference to the association before conversion, contained in any writing, whether executed or effective before or after the conversion, shall be deemed a reference also to the association after conversion, if not inconsistent with the other provisions of such writing. No pending action or other judicial proceeding to which the association is a party shall be abated or discontinued by reason of such conversion, but the same may be prosecuted to final judgment, order, or decree in the same manner as if such conversion had not occurred.

Any report filed under this subsection shall be accompanied by the plan of merger, duly executed by each merging association or corporation. The deputy director thereupon shall issue to the continuing association or corporation a certificate of merger, setting forth the name of each merging association or corporation and the name of the continuing association or corporation, and the articles of incorporation of the continuing association or corporation.

F. Unless required by its articles of incorporation, a vote of the members of the continuing association or corporation is not necessary to authorize a merger if either:

Ratable payments and distributions on withdrawable capital may be made at any time after the time fixed for the presentment and allowance of claims has elapsed. Holders of guaranty capital, if any, shall participate in the liquidation of the remaining assets after payment or provision for payment has been made in full to all creditors, holders of withdrawable capital, and any claims which the holders may have in the balance of any segregated reserves. Final distribution shall be made in accordance with section 6-472.

1. The liquidators shall file with the deputy director the duly verified final report of their acts and proposed final distribution.

2. On the deputy director's approval of the final report, the liquidators shall publish notice of the proposed final distribution and shall allow any holder of shares of guaranty capital to examine the records of the association to ascertain the holder's proper share of such distribution.

3. When final distribution has been made, except as to any money due to, but unclaimed by, any creditor, member, or other person, the liquidators shall deposit such unclaimed money with the deputy director, for payment to the person or persons entitled thereto on application and proof of right as provided by law.

4. The liquidators also shall deliver to the deputy director all books of account and other records of the association, for preservation for at least two years and destruction thereafter as provided by law.

A. The liquidation under this article of an association, and a receivership thereof, may, at the discretion of the receiver or receivers, be conducted and carried out in full or in part in the same manner as provided in this title for the liquidation of or receivership for an insolvent bank.

B. Regardless of whether the federal deposit insurance corporation serves as receiver or co-receiver of any insured association, when it pays or makes available for payment the liabilities of the insured association in receivership which are insured by it, it shall, upon the surrender and transfer to it of any account or investment certificate insured by it, be subrogated with respect to the account or investment certificate. The surrender and transfer of the account or investment certificate, however, shall not affect any right which the transferor thereof may have in any portion of the account or investment certificate which is uninsured, or any right to participate in the distribution of the net proceeds remaining from the disposition of the assets of the insured association, but if different provisions from the foregoing provisions of this and the preceding sentence would be applicable if the association were a federal savings and loan association, then the provisions shall be applicable under the laws of this state to the extent that they can validly be made so applicable. In any event the rights of the holders of accounts or investment certificates of the insured association shall be determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of the laws of this state.

C. The procedure provided for in this article for the liquidation of savings and loan associations shall be exclusive, and no receiver shall be appointed by any court of this state to take charge of the affairs of an association except as provided in this article.

1. On recommendations of the board of directors, the members of a credit union incorporated under the laws of this state, by an affirmative majority vote of all members voting in a meeting called for that purpose or by written ballot filed within fifteen days, may resolve to convert the credit union into a federal credit union or a credit union organized under the laws of another state.

2. Within twenty days after the meeting at which the members determine to so convert, the credit union shall file with the deputy director a certificate verified by the affidavit of the president or the chairman and the secretary of the credit union. The certificate shall contain a copy of the minutes of the meeting and a statement that the members have approved the determination to convert the credit union into a federal credit union or a credit union organized under the laws of another state.

3. The filing of the certificate required in paragraph 2 of this subsection with the deputy director is presumptive proof or evidence of the holding of the meeting and the action taken.

4. After the meeting of the members, the credit union shall take such action as is necessary under the federal law or the state law to which it is converting as a credit union. It shall also liquidate in a manner approved by the deputy director any assets or liabilities that are not by reason of law capable of being transferred to the converted credit union. Within ten days after the receipt of the new charter or certificate of incorporation, the credit union shall file with the deputy director and the corporation commission a copy of the instrument. On this filing, the credit union ceases to be a credit union incorporated under the laws of this state and is converted to one under its new jurisdiction.

5. At the time the conversion becomes effective, the credit union ceases to be supervised by this state and all of the property of the credit union, including all of its right, title and interest in and to all property of every kind and character, immediately by operation of law and without any conveyance or transfer and without any further act or deed is vested in the converted credit union under its new name and structure and under its new jurisdiction.

6. The converted credit union shall have, hold and enjoy the property prescribed in paragraph 5 of this subsection in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the property was possessed, held and enjoyed by it as a credit union under the laws of this state. The converted credit union continues to be responsible for all of the obligations of the former credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place. The converted credit union is merely a continuation of the former credit union under a new name and new jurisdiction and the revision of its corporate structure as is necessary for its proper operation under the new jurisdiction.

B. A credit union organized under the laws of the United States or of any other state may convert to a credit union incorporated under the laws of this state in the following manner:

1. To effect such a conversion a credit union shall first comply with all of the requirements of the jurisdiction under which it is organized and file proof of the compliance with the deputy director.

2. The converting credit union through its proper officers and officials shall sign and acknowledge in quintuplicate a certificate of organization as required in sections 6-506 and 6-507 in which they bind themselves to comply with the requirements of the certificate and with all the laws and rules applicable to a state credit union. The application for a certificate of organization in quintuplicate, the bylaws in duplicate and the required charter fee and examination assessment shall be submitted to the deputy director who shall make or cause to be made an appropriate investigation for the purpose of determining the advisability of such a conversion. On receipt of the  deputy director's certificate of organization in quadruplicate, with the certificate of approval, the applicants shall file the certificate of approval attached in quadruplicate with the corporation commission and record a certified copy of the filing under the seal of the commission with the county recorder of the county or counties in which the credit union is to do business. On proof of the recording, the corporation commission shall issue a certificate of incorporation to the credit union. The credit union shall forward a certified copy of the certificate of organization showing the filing and recording to the deputy director. The credit union shall also file with the corporation commission the appointment of an agent on whom service of process may be made.

3. Within ten days after the receipt of the certified copy of the certificate of incorporation by the credit union, the credit union shall file two certified copies of the certificate with its present supervisory agency and a copy of the transmittal letter with the deputy director.

4. On filing the certified copy of the certificate of organization with the deputy director, the converting credit union ceases to be a credit union under its former jurisdiction and is a credit union under the laws of this state. All of the property of the credit union, including all of its right, title and interest in and to all property of every kind and character, immediately, by operation of law and without any conveyance or transfer and without any further act or deed, is vested in the credit union under its new name and style as a state credit union and under its new jurisdiction.

5. The converted credit union shall have, hold and enjoy the property prescribed in paragraph 4 of this subsection in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the property was possessed, held and enjoyed by it as a credit union under its former jurisdiction and the converted credit union continues to be responsible for all of the obligations of the former credit union to the same extent as though conversion had not taken place. The converted credit union is merely a continuation of the former credit union under a new name and new jurisdiction and the revision of its corporate structure as is considered necessary for its proper operation under the new jurisdiction.

C. A credit union incorporated under the laws of this state may be converted into an association, as defined in section 6-401, that is incorporated under the laws of this state or of the United States if the credit union complies with both of the following:

1. The provisions established by the national credit union administration as prescribed by 12 Code of Federal Regulations part 708a.

E. A licensee shall mail periodic statements for consumer revolving loans and home equity revolving loans to the consumer within fourteen days after the end of each monthly billing cycle period. A billing cycle period is considered monthly if the closing date of the billing cycle period is the same day each month or does not vary by more than four days from that day.

2. On a consumer loan in an original principal amount of more than three thousand dollars, either:

(a) A consumer loan rate of thirty-six per cent on the initial three thousand dollars of the original principal amount, and a consumer loan rate of twenty-four per cent on that part of the principal amount greater than three thousand dollars.

(b) The single blended consumer loan rate that results from the total amount of finance charges that the licensee would receive through the scheduled maturity of the consumer loan at the consumer loan rates that otherwise would be applicable pursuant to subdivision (a) of this paragraph to the different portions of the unpaid principal balance, assuming that the consumer loan will be paid according to its agreed terms.

B. A licensee may contract for and receive periodic finance charges on consumer revolving loans and home equity revolving loans that are not more than the following amounts:

1. On consumer revolving loans with credit limits of three thousand dollars or less, a periodic rate corresponding to an annual percentage rate of thirty-six per cent on the outstanding balance each monthly billing cycle.

2. On consumer revolving loans with credit limits of more than three thousand dollars and home equity revolving loans, either:

(a) A periodic rate corresponding to an annual percentage rate of thirty-six per cent on that portion of the outstanding balance each monthly billing cycle that is not more than three thousand dollars and a periodic rate corresponding to an annual percentage rate of twenty-four per cent on that portion of the outstanding balance each monthly billing cycle that is more than three thousand dollars.

(b) A periodic rate corresponding to the single blended annual percentage rate that would result in a periodic finance charge during a monthly billing cycle that is not more than the finance charges that result from the application of the multiple periodic rates authorized by subdivision (a) of this paragraph.

C. A licensee may charge a fixed or variable rate of periodic finance charges on a consumer revolving loan or a home equity revolving loan, as provided by the agreement that establishes the consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan. The licensee shall not base a variable rate of periodic finance charges on an index that is under the control of the licensee. Unless the consumer can readily verify the index on which an adjustment in the rate of periodic finance charges is based, the licensee shall provide conspicuous notice of the rate adjustment at least one monthly billing cycle before the effective date of the rate adjustment. The licensee may include a rate adjustment notice on or with a periodic statement to the consumer. The corresponding annual percentage rate of periodic finance charges may not increase or decrease more than three percentage points in any period of twelve consecutive months, and the corresponding annual percentage rate of periodic finance charges may not increase or decrease more than seven percentage points above or below the initial annual percentage rate of periodic finance charges at the time the consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan is established.

D. Except as permitted by subsection E of this section, prepaid finance charges commonly referred to as points are prohibited.

E. In addition to the finance charges authorized in subsections A, B and C of this section, a licensee may contract for and receive, and collect finance charges on, nonrefundable prepaid finance charges or fees commonly referred to as points in an amount of not more than:

1. Four per cent of the original principal amount of a consumer loan of at least five thousand dollars secured by the consumer's principal residence.

2. Four per cent of the agreed on credit limit of a home equity revolving loan.

F. If a consumer loan, consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan is in existence before the effective date of this amendment to this section and is modified or restructured after the effective date of this amendment to this section and the total new cash advances do not exceed one hundred dollars, a licensee may not contract for and receive periodic finance charges at an annual percentage rate that is higher than the annual percentage rate that existed before the effective date of this amendment to this section.

#### Section 6-633. Computation of finance charges

A. A licensee shall compute and measure finance charges on consumer loans on unpaid balances outstanding from time to time. A licensee may also precompute finance charges on consumer loans on scheduled unpaid principal balances as provided in section 6-634. For the purposes of computing finance charges on consumer loans that are not precomputed, a licensee may calculate the finance charges on an annual basis of twelve months of thirty days each month or on a daily basis if a day is counted either as 1/360th, 1/365th or 1/366th of a year, as the licensee and consumer may agree in writing.

B. A licensee shall compute periodic finance charges on consumer revolving loans or home equity revolving loans on the unpaid balance of the consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan by either of the following methods:

1. By multiplying the daily periodic rate by the actual unpaid balance of the consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan each day during the billing cycle period. The daily periodic rate shall be determined by dividing the annual percentage rate by three hundred sixty-five.

2. By multiplying the monthly periodic rate by the average daily balance of the consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan during the billing cycle. The average daily balance is the sum of the unpaid balances of the consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan each day during the billing cycle period divided by the number of days in the billing cycle period. The monthly periodic rate is determined by dividing the annual percentage rate by twelve. The unpaid balance on any day is determined by adding to any balance unpaid as of the beginning of that day all advances and allowed additional fees and deducting all payments and other credits to the consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan that day.

C. A licensee may compute finance charges only on the unpaid principal balance, allowed additional fees and prepaid finance charges. A licensee shall not compound finance charges. Precomputation of the finance charges on a consumer loan does not constitute compounding of finance charges.

D. If part or all of the principal of a consumer loan is the unpaid principal balance of a prior precomputed consumer loan, the principal amount payable under such consumer loan may include any unpaid finance charges on the prior loan that have accrued within sixty days before the making of that consumer loan.

#### Section 6-634. Precomputation of consumer loan

A. A precomputed consumer loan shall require repayment in substantially equal consecutive monthly installments of principal and finance charges combined. The first installment of a precomputed consumer loan is due not less than fifteen days but not more than forty-five days after the precomputed consumer loan is made. The licensee may precompute finance charges at the agreed consumer loan rate on scheduled unpaid principal balances and add those charges to the principal amount of the precomputed consumer loan. The licensee shall calculate the finance charges on precomputed loans on an annual basis of twelve months of thirty days per month. All computations are based on the assumption that all payments are made as scheduled. The licensee may round the consumer loan rate to the nearest one-quarter of one per cent.

B. If a precomputed consumer loan is prepaid in full, the licensee shall provide the consumer with a refund or credit of the precomputed finance charges that apply to all of the fully unexpired months of the precomputed consumer loan as originally scheduled, or if deferred, as deferred, and that follow the installment date nearest to the date of the prepayment. For this purpose the applicable finance charge is the total of those finance charges that would have been made for each unexpired month by applying scheduled payments to unpaid balances of principal according to the actuarial method at that single consumer loan rate that would result in the original amount of precomputed finance charges on the consumer loan, assuming finance charges had not been precomputed at the agreed to consumer loan rate but had been computed by the actuarial method at the agreed to single consumer loan rate from the inception of the consumer loan.

C. The licensee may agree to defer payment of all wholly unpaid installments for one or more full months and extend the due date of each installment and the maturity of the precomputed consumer loan for the same amount of time. The deferment period is the month or months in which the consumer makes no scheduled payment or in which no payment is required by reason of the deferment. If a deferment is made, the licensee may charge and collect a deferral fee that is not more than the agreed to consumer loan rate applied to the amount or amounts deferred for the period of deferral without regard to differences in the lengths of months, but applied proportionately for a part of a month by counting each day as one-thirtieth of a month. The licensee may collect a deferral fee at the time the licensee assesses the deferral fee or at any time after the assessment. No rebate of deferral fees is required unless prepayment occurs before the due date of the first deferred installment.

D. If the maturity of a precomputed consumer loan is accelerated, the licensee shall reduce the outstanding balance of that precomputed consumer loan by the refund or credit of precomputed finance charges that the consumer would be entitled to receive pursuant to subsection B on prepayment in full on the date of acceleration. After application of that refund or credit, the licensee may charge and receive finance charges at the agreed to consumer loan rate computed on the unpaid balances of the consumer loan for the actual time outstanding from the installment date nearest the date of acceleration until paid in full.

E. The note or agreement evidencing a precomputed consumer loan may provide that the licensee, with or without accelerating maturity, may recompute the entire consumer loan on a per cent per month basis or may reduce the outstanding balance as of any installment date by the refund or credit of precomputed finance charges that the consumer would be entitled to receive pursuant to subsection B on prepayment in full on the installment date. After recomputing the loan or applying the refund or credit of precomputed finance charges, the licensee may charge and receive finance charges at the agreed to consumer loan rate computed on unpaid balances of the consumer loan for the actual time outstanding from the installment date until the consumer loan is paid in full.

#### Section 6-635. Other allowable fees; annual reporting

A. In addition to the finance charges authorized by section 6-632, a licensee may contract for and receive, and collect finance charges on, the following fees:

1. A delinquency charge in an amount equal to five percent of the amount of any installment not paid in full within seven days after its due date.

2. The actual costs of charges that are paid to a third party who is not an employee of the licensee and that are incurred in making consumer lender loans secured in whole or in part by real property, including the charges for a preliminary title search, title examination and report, title insurance premiums, property survey and appraisal fees.

3. Lawful fees for the acknowledging, filing and recording, continuing or releasing in any public office of any instrument or financing statement evidencing or perfecting a lien or security interest in real or personal property securing a consumer lender loan or the premiums paid for insurance in lieu of filing or recording that shall not exceed the filing or recording fee.

4. A loan origination fee of not more than five percent of a closed end consumer loan or the agreed credit limit of a consumer revolving loan but in no event in an amount that is more than $150. A licensee shall not charge a loan origination fee:

(a) For the refinancing of a closed end consumer loan or the renegotiating of an agreed credit limit of a consumer revolving loan if the refinancing or renegotiating occurs within one year of the collection of a prior loan origination fee.

(b) If the licensee charges prepaid finance charges pursuant to section 6-632, subsection E, paragraph 1.

5. Deferral fees authorized in section 6-634 for precomputed consumer loans.

6. Insurance premiums as provided in section 6-636.

7. Court costs.

8. Reasonable attorney fees if the consumer lender loan is referred for collection to an attorney other than a salaried employee of the licensee.

9. Costs, expenses and fees authorized in section 33-813, subsection B for reinstatement of a deed of trust encumbering real property that secures a consumer lender loan.

10. Costs and expenses of exercising the power of sale in a deed of trust encumbering real property that secures a consumer lender loan and costs and expenses of a sale that are included in a credit bid or that are applied from the proceeds of a trustee's sale pursuant to section 33-812, including the payment of trustee fees and reasonable attorney fees actually incurred.

11. Costs and expenses of retaking, holding, preparing for sale and selling any personal property in accordance with title 47, chapter 9, article 6.

B. If a licensee receives a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal or similar instrument drawn on a depository institution that is offered by a consumer in full or partial payment on a consumer lender loan and the instrument is not paid or is dishonored by the depository institution, the licensee may charge and collect from the consumer a dishonored check service fee pursuant to section 44-6852.

C. In addition to the finance charges and fees provided in this article, the licensee shall not directly or indirectly charge, contract for or receive any further or other amount in connection with a consumer lender loan.

D. In conjunction with the reporting requirements prescribed in section 6-609, on or before October 1 each year, a licensee shall report to the deputy director the number of closed end consumer loans and consumer revolving loans under $1,000 made in the prior two years.

#### Section 6-636. Insurance securing loan; cancellation; notice

A. The following types of insurance may be sold to the consumer in connection with a consumer lender loan and the consumer may contract for:

1. Property insurance covering any property securing a consumer lender loan.

2. Life insurance insuring the life of one or more consumers obligated on a consumer lender loan.

3. Credit disability insurance that provides indemnity for payments due on a consumer lender loan while any covered consumer has a disability.

4. Credit involuntary unemployment insurance that provides indemnity for payments due on a consumer lender loan while one or more consumers are involuntarily unemployed.

5. Accidental death and dismemberment insurance providing a benefit if death occurs as a result of an accident or if dismemberment occurs.

6. Disability income protection insurance providing a benefit if a total disability occurs during the term of insurance.

B. Any insurance purchased by a consumer from or through a licensee, except insurance on property securing a consumer lender loan, is optional, and a licensee shall not refuse to make a consumer lender loan based on the consumer's refusal to purchase the insurance. The consumer may cancel any insurance purchased in connection with a consumer lender loan for any reason at any time within thirty days after the consumer lender loan is made and shall mail or deliver a written notice of the cancellation to the licensee's place of business. If the consumer cancels the insurance pursuant to this subsection, the consumer is entitled to a full refund of any premiums paid for the insurance. Before executing the note or agreement evidencing a consumer lender loan that includes a premium for insurance, the licensee shall give the consumer the disclosures required to exclude those insurance premiums from the finance charge in accordance with the truth in lending act.

C. At the time the insurance is sold the licensee shall mail or deliver a written receipt or binder to the consumer. Within thirty days after mailing or delivering the written receipt or binder, the licensee shall deliver to the consumer, or if more than one, to any one of them, a policy or certificate of insurance covering any insurance purchased by or through the licensee or any employee or affiliate of the licensee in connection with the consumer lender loan that sets forth the amount of any premium that the consumer has paid or is obligated to pay, the amount of insurance, the term of insurance and a description of the coverage. The policy or certificate may contain a mortgagee clause or other appropriate provisions to protect the insurable interest of the licensee.

D. All property insurance sold pursuant to this section shall bear a reasonable bona fide relation to the existing hazard or risk of loss and shall be written by an agent licensed in this state and by an insurance company authorized to conduct property insurance business in this state. A licensee shall not require the purchase of property insurance from the licensee or any employee, affiliate or associate of the licensee as a condition precedent to the making of a consumer lender loan. The licensee may otherwise designate the company in which the insurance shall be placed as long as the insurance company is authorized to conduct business in this state.

E. Property insurance, if sold by a licensee in connection with a consumer loan, is at the option of the consumer in an amount not exceeding the greater of the reasonable value of the property insured as designated in writing by the consumer or the approximate amount of the consumer loan and shall be for a term not exceeding the approximate term of the consumer loan. However, the amount of this property insurance may not exceed the designated value of the property insured.

F. If a licensee sells property insurance in connection with a consumer revolving loan or a home equity revolving loan, the amount of the property insurance shall not exceed the greater of the reasonable value of the property insured as designated in writing by the consumer or the agreed on credit limit. However, the amount of property insurance shall not exceed the designated value of the insured property. The licensee may sell property insurance for renewable terms of not more than two years. Alternatively, the amount of property insurance may be equal to the balance outstanding on a consumer revolving loan or a home equity revolving loan from time to time with the premiums calculated on the basis of the actual daily unpaid balance or the average daily balance of the account during each billing cycle period. Premiums for property insurance may be charged as an advance on a consumer revolving loan or a home equity revolving loan.

G. If the licensee sells the consumer property insurance for a renewable term, the licensee shall mail a notice to the consumer at least thirty days before the renewal date that states all of the following:

1. The consumer's property insurance is about to expire.

2. The consumer may obtain property insurance from any source chosen by the consumer subject to the licensee's right to reasonably reject the insurer chosen by the consumer by providing written notice to the consumer of those reasons for rejection.

3. The term, coverage and premium for the renewal of property insurance.

4. The property insurance will be renewed on expiration unless the consumer provides the licensee before the expiration date with evidence that the consumer has obtained other property insurance.

H. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any advantage, commission, dividend, gain or identifiable charge for insurance authorized by this section, or otherwise, to the licensee or any employee or affiliate of the licensee from that insurance or its sale is not an additional finance charge or other allowed fee in connection with the consumer lender loan. If the licensee provides a new consumer lender loan or renews a contract of a consumer lender loan and the licensee sells the consumer new insurance, the licensee shall apply the insurance provided for in this section to the new loan or renewal, or the licensee shall cancel the prior insurance and provide the consumer with a refund or credit of the unearned premium or identifiable charge before selling the new insurance to the consumer.

I. The licensee shall determine the refund of unearned premiums for credit life insurance and credit disability insurance on prepayment in full according to title 20, chapter 6, article 10.

J. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, insurance transactions pursuant to this chapter are subject in all respects to the applicable laws pertaining to that insurance pursuant to title 20 and to the applicable rules adopted pursuant to title 20.

 

#### Section 6-637. Term; payments

A. The scheduled term of a consumer loan shall not be longer than the following:

1. Twenty-four months and fifteen days from the date of making a consumer loan of one thousand dollars or less.

2. Thirty-six months and fifteen days from the date of making a consumer loan of more than one thousand dollars but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars.

3. Forty-eight months and fifteen days from the date of making a consumer loan of more than two thousand five hundred dollars but not more than four thousand dollars.

C. Pursuant to the provisions of 12 United States Code section 3804, subsections A and B of this section shall not be superseded by the provisions of 12 United States Code

D. Balloon payments, prepayment penalties, call options and other contract provisions that permit a consumer lender to accelerate payment of a consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan for any reason other than the consumer's default as provided in the agreement evidencing the consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan are prohibited, except that a licensee may include a call option to be exercised at least fifteen years after the date of the agreement. If the licensee exercises this call option and the consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan is not in default, the licensee shall amortize the amount due on the account over at least sixty monthly installments.

E. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, an agreement evidencing a consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan shall provide that on termination of the right to obtain advances the outstanding principal balance and finance charges at the time of termination of the right to obtain advances are repayable in installments if a consumer is not in default as provided in the agreement. These installments shall provide for the scheduled repayment of principal and finance charges in approximately equal periodic installments except as a result of an adjustment in the index on which a variable rate of periodic finance charges is based. These installments are payable within the following time limits:

1. Twenty-four months and fifteen days from the date of termination of the right to obtain advances for an outstanding principal balance on that date of one thousand dollars or less.

2. Thirty-six months and fifteen days from the date of termination of the right to obtain advances for an outstanding principal balance on that date that is more than one thousand dollars but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars.

3. Forty-eight months and fifteen days from the date of termination of the right to obtain advances for an outstanding principal balance on that date that is more than two thousand five hundred dollars but not more than four thousand dollars.

5. Any agreed on time period for an outstanding principal balance that is more than six thousand dollars on the date of termination of the right to obtain advances.

F. A licensee shall permit a consumer to prepay any scheduled installment or additional amount due on any consumer lender loan in advance at any time during the licensee's regular business hours, but the licensee may apply that prepayment first to all finance charges accrued through the date of that prepayment.

G. On payment in full or renewal of a consumer lender loan, the licensee shall provide written notice of payment and release to the consumer, or if more than one consumer is obligated on the consumer lender loan, to any one of the consumers. The notice of payment and release shall include the date of the original note or agreement evidencing the consumer lender loan and the date of payment in full. In lieu of the notice of payment and release, the licensee may return the original note or agreement evidencing the consumer lender loan marked paid or renewed, as applicable. The licensee shall release any lien or security interest on property securing a consumer lender loan that is paid in full as provided in section 33-707 for real property and section 47-9513 for personal property. This subsection does not apply to a consumer revolving loan or home equity revolving loan on which there is no unpaid balance if the consumer's right to receive advances on the account continues in effect.

#### Section 6-638. Other insurance

No person shall engage in the business for compensation of receiving money as agent of a debtor for the purpose of distributing that money to the debtor's creditors in payment or partial payment of the debtor's obligations without first obtaining a license from the deputy director.

A. An application for a license shall be in writing, under oath and in a form prescribed by the deputy director, and shall contain the name and address, both of the residence and place of business, of the applicant and if the applicant is an association or society, of every member thereof, and if a corporation or partnership, of every officer and director thereof and a copy of the articles of incorporation, and the specific address or addresses at which the business is to be conducted. The deputy director may require as part of the application a credit report and such other information as the deputy director deems necessary.

B. At the time of filing the application the applicant shall furnish a cash or surety bond payable to the people of the state in the sum of not less than $5,000 for licensees disbursing less than $100,000 each year and for the following amounts based on the amounts disbursed by the licensee in the previous license year:

The bond shall be approved by the deputy director and filed in the office of the deputy director. The bond shall remain in force and effect until the surety is released from liability by the deputy director, or until the surety bond is canceled by the surety. The surety may cancel the surety bond and be relieved of further liability by delivering thirty days' written notice to the deputy director. The cancellation does not affect any liability incurred or accrued prior to the termination of the thirty-day period. Any person who suffers any loss or damage by reason of the neglect or default of a licensee or his employees or agents or by the licensee's violation of any of the provisions of this article or of the contract between the licensee and the debtor shall have a right of action against the licensee and the sureties on his bond.

In addition to the bond provided in subsection B of this section, the deputy director may require an applicant to obtain an adequate fidelity bond for each officer, employee, or agent having access to funds collected by or for the licensee or having authority to draw against such funds. The fidelity bond required to be filed in accordance with this section shall remain in force and effect until the surety is released from liability by the deputy director, or until the bond is canceled by the surety. The surety may cancel the bond and be relieved of further liability by delivering thirty days' written notice to the deputy director. The cancellation shall not affect any liability incurred or accrued prior to the termination of the thirty-day period.

E. Each applicant for a license shall file with his application a blank copy of the contract intended to be used between the licensee and the debtor and shall file with the deputy director a copy of all changes and amendments thereto.

#### Section 6-705. Branch offices and agencies

A. On the filing of the application and the payment of the fees and the approval of the bond, or bonds, the deputy director shall investigate the facts, and if the deputy director finds that the financial responsibility and experience of the applicant are such as to command the confidence of the community to warrant belief that the business will be operated fairly and honestly and within the purposes of this article, the deputy director shall issue the applicant a license to do business as a debt management company.

B. The license shall be kept conspicuously posted in the business office of the licensee. The license is not transferable or assignable.

K. If a licensee desires to change the licensee's place of business or the name of the company under which the license is issued, the licensee shall give written notice of the change within fifteen days to the deputy director and shall submit the license to the deputy director who shall enter an order allowing the change and who shall amend the license accordingly.

The deputy director may assess a penalty of $5 for each day the licensee fails to file such report.

#### Section 6-710. Prohibitions

It is unlawful for a licensee to:

1. Accept an account unless it appears on the basis of a reasonable budget analysis, reduced to writing, that the debtor can reasonably meet the payments agreed on by the licensee and the debtor and that the agreed on payment is sufficient to pay the service charges to the licensee and the full amount of the proposed payments to creditors as agreed on by the licensee and debtor. The licensee shall retain the written budget analysis for at least three years after the termination of the contract in the files of the licensee. The licensee shall make the analysis available for inspection by the deputy director, except that such a budget analysis is not deemed unreasonable if facts that would prove it to be such were not furnished to the licensee by the debtor on request.

2. Unless agreed on by the debtor, attempt to alter any scheduled payment listed on the original application from the debtor to any figure other than the amount agreed on by the debtor and creditors in those cases when a contractual installment exists.  Acceptance of the proposed payment by the creditor shall not alter any rights the creditor has under the creditor's original contract with the debtor.

A copy of the audit report shall be filed with the deputy director not more than one hundred twenty days after the end of the escrow agent's fiscal year. The audit requirement may be satisfied by filing a copy of the audit report, which is prepared by a certified public accountant, of the parent of the escrow agent including an audit of the escrow, account servicing and subdivision trust activities of the escrow agent within the prescribed time period. The deputy director may extend the time period in this subsection up to ninety days for good cause shown.

If reportable conditions are identified, the report on reportable conditions shall recommend specific measures to improve the escrow agent's internal control structure.

#### Section 6-833. Seizure of property of impaired escrow agent

When the deputy director ascertains by examination or otherwise that the assets or capital of any agent are impaired, or that the agent's affairs are in an unsafe condition, the deputy director may immediately take possession of all the property, business and assets of the agent that are located in this state and retain possession of them pending the further proceedings specified in this section. If the board of directors or any officer or person in charge of the offices of the agent refuses to allow the deputy director to take possession as prescribed by this subsection, the deputy director shall communicate such fact to the attorney general, whereupon the attorney general shall immediately institute such proceedings as may be necessary to place the deputy director in immediate possession of the property of the agent.

B. The officers, directors or stockholders of the agent may have sixty days after the date the deputy director takes possession of the property, business and assets to make good any deficit that may exist or to remedy the unsafe condition of its affairs. At the expiration of this time, if the deficiency in assets or capital has not been made good or the unsafe condition remedied, the deputy director may apply to the court to be appointed receiver and proceed to liquidate the assets of the agent that are located in this state in the same manner as provided by law for liquidation of a private corporation in receivership. The inventory made by the deputy director and all claims filed by creditors shall be open at all reasonable times for inspection and any action taken by the receiver on any of the claims shall be subject to the approval of the court before whom the cause is pending.

A. In a receivership proceeding filed against an escrow agent, the priority of distribution of claims from the general assets of the escrow agent shall be as provided by this section.

Subclasses may not be established in any class. The order of distribution is as follows:

1. The costs and expenses of administration incurred in connection with the receivership proceedings.

2. Claims for compensation actually owing to employees of the escrow agent other than its officers for services rendered within three months before the beginning of a receivership against the escrow agent.

This priority is in lieu of any other similar priority authorized by law as to wages or compensation of employees.

3. Claims for breach of escrow agreements.

4. Claims of general creditors that do not fall within any other priority under this section.

5. Claims of the federal, any state or a local government except those claims that are treated as secured claims.

These monies shall be deposited immediately on receipt or as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable.

A. A real property escrow agent that is a title insurance agent shall disclose to the buyer and seller of a residential dwelling that the title insurer shall offer on request a closing protection letter that provides protection for the loss of escrow monies due to fraud or dishonesty of the escrow agent. This disclosure requirement applies only to transactions involving a buyer and seller of a residential dwelling and shall be made when the buyer or seller employs the escrow agent.

1. Theft or misappropriation of settlement monies in connection with a transaction in which a title insurance policy will be issued by or on behalf of the title insurer issuing the closing protection letter, but only to the extent that the theft relates to the status of the title to that interest in land or to the validity, enforceability and priority of the lien of the mortgage on that interest in land.

2. As to a buyer or lender, failure to comply with the written closing instructions when agreed to by the settlement agent, title insurance agent or employee of the title insurer, but only to the extent that the failure to follow the instructions relates to the status of the title to that interest in land or to the validity, enforceability and priority of the lien of the mortgage on that interest in land.

#### Section 6-846. Making of escrow rates

A. Every escrow agent who is also a title insurer or title insurance agent licensed under title 20 shall make escrow rates that are not excessive or inadequate for the safety and soundness of the escrow agent, that do not unfairly discriminate between risks in this state which involve essentially the same exposure to loss and expense elements and that give due consideration to the following:

2. The necessity, by encouraging growth in assets of escrow agents in periods of high business activity, of assuring the financial solvency of escrow agents in periods of economic depression.

3. The necessity for paying dividends on the capital stock of escrow agents sufficient to induce capital to be invested in the capital stock.

B. Every escrow agent who is required to make escrow rates under subsection A shall adopt basic classifications of escrow services that will be used as the basis for its escrow rates.

C. Rates for escrow services and title insurance policies that are issued in connection with escrow services shall not be combined.

#### Section 6-846.01. Filing of escrow rates

On written application by the escrow agent making the filing, the deputy director may authorize part or all of a filing to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period or any extension.

D. Except in the case of rates filed under subsection E of this section, a filing that has become effective is deemed to meet the requirements of this article.

E. If the deputy director finds that a rate for a particular kind or class of escrow service cannot practicably be filed before it is used or a kind of escrow service, by reason of rarity or peculiar circumstances, does not lend itself to advance determination and filing of rates, the deputy director pursuant to rules adopted by the deputy director may allow the rate to be used without a previous filing and waiting period.

#### Section 6-846.02. Justification for escrow rates

A. An escrow agent shall accompany a rate filing with a statement setting forth the basis on which the rate was fixed and the manner in which the fees are to be computed. A filing may be justified by:

2. The escrow agent's interpretation of any statistical data on which the agent relied.

3. The experience of other escrow agents.

4. Any other factors that the escrow agent deems relevant.

B. The statement and justification shall be open to public inspection after the rate to which the statement and justification apply becomes effective.

#### Section 6-846.03. Disapproval of escrow filings

A. Before issuing an order of disapproval and not less than twenty days after written notice, the deputy director shall hold a hearing on an escrow rate filing. The notice shall specify in reasonable detail the matters to be considered at the hearing and shall be sent to every escrow agent who made the filing. If after the hearing the deputy director finds that all or part of the filing does not satisfy this article, the deputy director shall issue an order that specifies what part of the filing failed and, if the filing has become effective under section 6-846.01, when all or part of the filing will be deemed no longer effective. At any time an escrow agent may withdraw all or part of a filing. The deputy director shall send copies of the order to each escrow agent affected. The order does not affect any escrow that was contracted before the expiration of the period set forth in the order.

B. On written application to the deputy director, a person or organization other than the escrow agent who made the filing that is aggrieved with respect to any rate filing that is in effect may request a hearing. The application shall specify in reasonable detail the grounds on which the applicant is relying. If within thirty days after receipt of the application the deputy director finds that the application was made in good faith, that the applicant would be aggrieved if the applicant's grounds are established and that the grounds justify a hearing, the deputy director, not less than twenty days after written notice to the applicant and every escrow agent who made the filing, shall hold a hearing. If after the hearing the deputy director finds that all or part of the filing does not satisfy this article, the deputy director shall issue an order that specifies what part of the filing failed and, if the filing has become effective under section 6-846.01, when all or part of the filing will be deemed no longer effective. The deputy director shall send copies of the order to the applicant and to each escrow agent affected. The order does not affect any escrow that was contracted before the expiration of the period set forth in the order.

C. A filing or modification shall not be disapproved if the rates satisfy the requirements of this article.

#### Section 6-846.04. Deviations in escrow rates; civil penalty

A. An escrow agent may not deviate from his escrow rates that are in effect pursuant to section 6-846.01.

B. If the deputy director finds that an escrow rate has been charged that deviates from the escrow rate in effect pursuant to section 6-846.01, the escrow agent may be subject to a penalty that is equal to the difference between the rate charged and the allowable rate in effect pursuant to section 6-846.01.

C. If the deputy director finds that an escrow agent knowingly or with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice violated subsection A of this section with respect to a particular provision of the applicable escrow rate, the deputy director, in addition to the penalty imposed under subsection B of this section, may:

1. For each violation, impose an additional penalty of not more than two times the penalty imposed under subsection B of this section.

2. Revoke the escrow agent's license.

D. In addition to penalties imposed under subsection B or C of this section, the deputy director may impose civil penalties pursuant to section 6-132 if the deputy director finds that an escrow agent knowingly violated subsection A of this section with respect to a particular provision of the applicable escrow rate by charging rates that are greater than the rates allowable pursuant to section 6-846.01.

1. The loan originator was not employed by a mortgage broker, mortgage banker or consumer lender at the time of the transaction.

2. The loan originator's employing mortgage broker, mortgage banker or consumer lender would not have been liable to the claimant because the loan originator acted outside the scope of employment in the transaction.

G. The deputy director, at the deputy director's sole discretion, may waive compliance with one or more of the requirements prescribed by subsection E, paragraph 8 or subsection F of this section if the claim is based on an award pursuant to a criminal restitution order or if the deputy director is satisfied that the claimant has taken all reasonable steps to collect the amount of the judgment or the unsatisfied part of the judgment from all judgment debtors but has been unable to collect.

H. If the deputy director finds it is likely that the total remaining liability of the recovery fund is insufficient to pay in full the valid claims of all aggrieved persons who may have claims against any one licensee, the deputy director may petition the court to initiate a proration proceeding. The court shall grant the petition and order a hearing to distribute the total remaining liability of the fund among the applicants in the ratio that their respective claims bear to the aggregate of the valid claims or in another manner that the court deems equitable.  The deputy director or any party may file a proposed plan for equitable distribution of the available monies.  The distribution of monies shall be among the persons entitled to share them, without regard to the order of priority in which their respective judgments may have been obtained or their respective applications may have been filed. The court may require all applicants and prospective applicants against one licensee to be joined in one action if the respective rights of all the applicants to the recovery fund may be equitably adjudicated and settled. The court shall not include in the claims for proration the claim of any person who has not, within ninety days after the court has entered the order for proration, filed a complaint with the court, served the licensee and provided written notice of the claim to the deputy director. The liability of the fund on any application affected by a proration proceeding is based on the limits in effect on the date when the last application for payment is filed.  The court may refuse to consider or award prorated recovery to any person who fails to expeditiously prosecute a claim against the licensee or promptly file an application for payment and submit supporting documentation as required by this article.

I. If, at any time, the money deposited in the mortgage recovery fund is insufficient to satisfy any duly authorized claim or portion of a claim, the deputy director, when sufficient money has been deposited in the mortgage recovery fund, shall satisfy the unpaid claims or portions of claims, in the order that the claims or portions of claims were originally filed, plus accumulated interest at the rate of four percent a year.

A. The lessor shall have a landlord's lien upon the contents of a repository for the rent.

The interest is to be computed on the balance of the premiums due, after subtracting the down payment made by the insured in accordance with the premium finance agreement, from the effective date of the earliest insurance contract for which the premiums are being advanced to and including the date when the final installment of the premium finance agreement is payable.

C. On any premium finance agreement in any original principal amount not exceeding one thousand dollars, a licensee may contract for and receive an interest charge at a rate not exceeding three per cent per month or thirty-six per cent per annum.

D. On any premium finance agreement in which the original principal amount exceeds one thousand dollars, a licensee may contract for and receive an interest charge at a rate not exceeding three per cent per month on that part of the original principal amount not exceeding one thousand dollars, and two per cent per month on that part of the principal exceeding one thousand dollars.

E. A licensee may contract for and receive an interest charge on the entire amount of the unpaid principal balance of the premium finance agreement at the single annual percentage rate which would earn not more than the total amount of interest charges at the scheduled maturity of the premium finance agreement as would the several different rates that otherwise would be applicable under subsection D, to different portions of the unpaid principal balance, if the premium finance agreement is paid according to the agreed terms.

F. For the purposes of computing an interest charge, it is permissible to calculate the interest charges on an annual basis of twelve months of thirty days each or on a daily basis if a day is counted either as 1/360th, 1/365th, or 1/366th of a year, as the licensee and insured may agree in writing.

G. If the premium finance agreement requires repayment in substantially equal and consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest charges combined and the first installment falls due no less than fifteen nor more than forty-five days after the effective date of the policy, the interest charges may be precomputed at the agreed rate on scheduled unpaid principal balances and added to the principal amount advanced under the premium finance agreement, subject to the following requirements:

1. Any insured may prepay the obligation in full at any time. If prepayment in full occurs by a new premium finance agreement, renewal or refinancing, or by cash, the insured shall be refunded or credited with the precomputed charges which are applicable to all fully unexpired months of the premium finance agreement as originally scheduled. For this purpose the applicable interest charge is the total of those charges which would have been made for each such unexpired month by applying scheduled payments to unpaid balances of principal according to the actuarial method at that single annual interest rate which would earn the original amount of precomputed interest charges on the premium finance agreement, assuming interest charges had not been precomputed at the contract rate but had been computed by actuarial method at that single annual interest rate from the inception of the premium finance agreement. All computations shall be based on the assumption that all payments are made as scheduled. The licensee may round the annual interest rate to the nearest one-quarter of one per cent. In this paragraph, "actuarial method" means the method of allocating each payment between interest charges and principal pursuant to which the payment is applied first to interest charges computed on the unpaid balance of principal for the time the balance is outstanding, and the remainder of the payment is subtracted from the unpaid principal amount.

2. If the maturity of the premium finance agreement is accelerated, the contract balance shall be reduced by the refund or credits of precomputed interest charges which would be required for prepayment in full on the date of acceleration, and thereafter the licensee may receive the interest charges authorized in this section computed on unpaid balances of the premium finance agreement for the time actually outstanding from the installment date nearest the date of acceleration until paid. The premium finance agreement may provide that the premium finance company, with or without accelerating maturity, may recompute the entire amount due under the premium finance agreement on a per cent per month basis or reduce the premium finance agreement balance as of any installment date by the refund or credit of precomputed interest charges which would be required for prepayment in full on such installment date and receive the interest charges authorized by this section computed on unpaid balances of the premium finance agreement for the time actually outstanding from such installment date until the premium finance agreement is fully paid.

#### Section 6-1413. Other charges allowed

A. A licensee may contract for, and if so contracted for, may collect a service charge for financing or arranging the financing of premiums under the agreement in an amount not to exceed ten dollars for each premium finance agreement. The service charge need not be refunded on cancellation, prepayment or acceleration of the agreement.

B. A premium finance agreement on a contract providing insurance coverage for an individual, family or household purpose, may provide for the payment by the insured of a delinquency charge of five per cent of the delinquent installment or ten dollars, whichever is less, on any installment which is in default for a period of five days or more.

C. A premium finance agreement on a contract providing insurance coverage for any entity involved in transactions solely for business purposes may provide for the payment by the insured of a delinquency charge of five per cent of the delinquent installment on any installment which is in default for a period of five days or more.

D. If the default results in the cancellation of any insurance contract listed in the premium finance agreement, the premium finance agreement may provide for the payment by the insured of a cancellation charge of fifteen dollars.

E. A licensee that receives a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal or similar instrument drawn on a bank or other depository institution which is offered by an insured in full or partial payment on a premium finance agreement and the instrument is not paid or is dishonored by the institution, may charge and collect from the insured a bad check charge in the amount of ten dollars or the actual charge made to the premium finance company by the depository institution for the return of the unpaid or dishonored instrument, whichever is more.

F. A premium finance agreement may provide for payment of collection costs, attorney fees equal to twenty per cent of the outstanding indebtedness and any other charges which arise because of breach of the contract.

G. The charges referred to in this section shall not be considered directly or indirectly to be interest or prepaid finance charges for entering into a premium finance agreement.

H. A premium finance company shall not, except as otherwise provided by law, impose, take, receive from, reserve or charge an insured greater charges than are permitted by this article.

#### Section 6-1414. Splitting of premium finance agreement prohibited

No agent or broker or premium finance company shall induce an insured to become obligated under more than one premium finance agreement for the purpose of obtaining a higher rate of interest than would otherwise be permitted by this chapter or obtaining more than one service charge.

#### Section 6-1415. Cancellation of insurance contract upon default

A. If a premium finance agreement contains a power of attorney enabling the licensee to cancel any insurance contract or contracts listed in the agreement, the insurance contract or contracts shall not be cancelled by the licensee unless the cancellation is in accordance with this section.

B. The licensee shall mail written notice to the insured at his last known address as shown on the records of the licensee not less than ten days in advance to notify the insured of its intent to cancel the insurance contract unless the default is cured within the ten day period.

C. After expiration of the ten day period, the licensee may cancel the insurance contract or contracts by mailing a notice of cancellation to the insurer. The insurance contract shall be cancelled as if the notice of cancellation had been submitted by the insured himself but without requiring the return of the insurance contract. The licensee shall also mail a notice of cancellation to the insured at his last known address as shown on the records of the licensee. If the provisions of subsection D do not apply to the cancellation of coverage, the effective date of cancellation under this subsection is the date on which the licensee mails a notice of cancellation to the insurer and the insured. The licensee shall maintain a log or any other record that documents compliance with this section.

D. If statutory, regulatory and contractual restrictions provide that the insurance contract may not be cancelled unless notice is given to a governmental agency, mortgagee or other third party, the insurer shall give the prescribed notice on behalf of itself or the insured to any governmental agency, mortgagee or other third party on or before the fifth business day after the day it receives the notice of cancellation from the licensee. The effective date of cancellation under this subsection shall be as stated in the insurance policy. The insurer shall maintain a log or any other record that documents its receipt of any notice from a licensee as provided by this section.

#### Section 6-1416. Return premiums

A. Except as provided in subsection B, if a financed insurance policy is cancelled by any party, the insurer shall return the gross unearned premiums due under the policy directly to the premium finance company for the account of the insured as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than twenty days after the effective date of cancellation of a policy providing insurance coverage for an individual, family or household purpose or not more than forty-five days after the effective date of cancellation of a policy providing insurance coverage for any entity involved in transactions solely for business purposes. The licensee shall maintain a list of all insurers that fail to return gross unearned premiums due under the insurance policy within the period specified by this subsection. The list shall include the name of the insurer, the name of the insured, the applicable insurance policy number, the date of cancellation of the insurance policy and the date the licensee received the gross unearned premium due under the insurance policy.

B. If a financed insurance policy is cancelled by any party in connection with a policy that provides insurance coverage for any entity involved in transactions solely for business purposes in which the policy is subject to an audit to calculate the actual premium of the policy, the insurer shall return any gross unearned premiums due under the policy directly to the premium finance company for the account of the insured as soon as reasonably possible, but not more than forty-five days after the effective date of cancellation. If an audit is required to calculate the actual premium due, the insurer shall notify the licensee not more than forty-five days after the effective date of cancellation and specify the time to complete the audit and make the payment to the licensee. The licensee shall maintain a list of all insurers that fail to return gross unearned premiums due under the insurance policy within the period specified by this subsection. The list shall include the name of the insurer, the name of the insured, the applicable insurance policy number, the date of cancellation of the insurance policy, the final premium determined as a result of the audit and the date the licensee received the gross unearned premium due under the insurance policy.

C. If an insurer returns any unearned premium to a person other than the premium finance company named in the premium finance agreement, the insurer is liable to that premium finance company for any and all unearned premiums due as a result of the cancellation. The insurer shall furnish to the agent or broker placing the insurance a report setting forth an itemization of the unearned premiums under the policy.

D. If the crediting of return premiums to the account of the insured results in a surplus over the amount due from the insured, the licensee shall refund the excess within ten working days of receipt of the return premium by mailing to the agent or broker placing the insurance a check for the excess made payable jointly to the insured and the agent or broker, and shall furnish the agent or broker a report setting forth an itemization of the unearned finance charge and other charges under the premium finance agreement. A refund is not required when the excess due the insured is less than one dollar.

E. On receipt of the refund check from the licensee, the agent or broker shall return any unearned premiums to the insured either in person or by depositing the refund in the mail within ten working days of receipt of the refund.

F. Failure to refund any surplus or return any unearned premium or to furnish any reports required under subsection D shall not invalidate a notice of cancellation given in accordance with this chapter.

#### Section 6-1417. Servicing of premium finance agreements

A. A licensee may receive and disburse monies in the servicing of premium finance agreements. All monies received in the process of servicing these agreements shall be kept separate, distinct and apart from funds belonging to the licensee and shall be deposited with a financial institution located in this state or a financial institution in another state that maintains insurance on its deposits by the federal deposit insurance corporation. All funds collected shall remain in the financial institution until remitted to the person entitled to the funds.

B. The licensee shall keep a record of all monies collected and the remittance of the monies.
