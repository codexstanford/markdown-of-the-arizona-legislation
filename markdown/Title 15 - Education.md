#### Section 15-185. Charter schools; financing; civil penalties; transportation; definition

A. A school district is not financially responsible for any charter school that is sponsored by the state board of education, the state board for charter schools, a university under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents, a community college district or a group of community college districts.

B. Financial provisions for a charter school that is sponsored by the state board of education, the state board for charter schools, a university, a community college district or a group of community college districts are as follows:

1. The charter school shall calculate a base support level as prescribed in section 15-943, except that:

(a) Section 15-941 does not apply to these charter schools.

(b) The small school weights prescribed in section 15-943, paragraph 1 apply if a charter holder holds one charter for one or more school sites and the average daily membership for the school sites are combined for the calculation of the small school weight. The small school weight shall not be applied individually to a charter holder if one or more of the following conditions exist and the combined average daily membership derived from the following conditions is greater than six hundred:

(i) The organizational structure or management agreement of the charter holder requires the charter holder or charter school to contract with a specific management company.

(ii) The governing body of the charter holder has identical membership to another charter holder in this state.

(iii) The charter holder is a subsidiary of a corporation that has other subsidiaries that are charter holders in this state.

(iv) The charter holder holds more than one charter in this state.

(c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of this paragraph, for fiscal years 2015-2016 and 2016-2017, the department of education shall reduce by thirty-three percent the amount provided by the small school weight for charter schools prescribed in subdivision (b) of this paragraph.

2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1 of this subsection, the student count shall be determined initially using an estimated student count based on actual registration of pupils before the beginning of the school year. Notwithstanding section 15-1042, subsection F, student level data submitted to the department may be used to determine estimated student counts.  After the first forty days, one hundred days or two hundred days in session, as applicable, the charter school shall revise the student count to be equal to the actual average daily membership, as defined in section 15-901, of the charter school. Before the fortieth day, one hundredth day or two hundredth day in session, as applicable, the state board of education, the state board for charter schools, the sponsoring university, the sponsoring community college district or the sponsoring group of community college districts may require a charter school to report periodically regarding pupil enrollment and attendance, and the department of education may revise its computation of equalization assistance based on the report. A charter school shall revise its student count, base support level and charter additional assistance before May 15.  A charter school that overestimated its student count shall revise its budget before May 15.  A charter school that underestimated its student count may revise its budget before May 15.

3. A charter school may use section 15-855 for the purposes of this section. The charter school and the department of education shall prescribe procedures for determining average daily membership.

4. Equalization assistance for the charter school shall be determined by adding the amount of the base support level and charter additional assistance. The amount of the charter additional assistance is  $1,985.58 per student count in preschool programs for children with disabilities, kindergarten programs and grades one through eight and $2,314.16 per student count in grades nine through twelve.

5. The state board of education shall apportion state aid from the appropriations made for such purposes to the state treasurer for disbursement to the charter schools in each county in an amount as determined by this paragraph. The apportionments shall be made as prescribed in section 15-973, subsection B.

6. The charter school shall not charge tuition for pupils who reside in this state, levy taxes or issue bonds. A charter school may admit pupils who are not residents of this state and shall charge tuition for those pupils in the same manner prescribed in section 15-823.

7. Not later than noon on the day preceding each apportionment date established by paragraph 5 of this subsection, the superintendent of public instruction shall furnish to the state treasurer an abstract of the apportionment and shall certify the apportionment to the department of administration, which shall draw its warrant in favor of the charter schools for the amount apportioned.

C. If a pupil is enrolled in both a charter school and a public school that is not a charter school, the sum of the daily membership, which includes enrollment as prescribed in section 15-901, subsection A, paragraph 1, subdivisions (a) and (b) and daily attendance as prescribed in section 15-901, subsection A, paragraph 5, for that pupil in the school district and the charter school shall not exceed 1.0. If a pupil is enrolled in both a charter school and a public school that is not a charter school, the department of education shall direct the average daily membership to the school with the most recent enrollment date. On validation of actual enrollment in both a charter school and a public school that is not a charter school and if the sum of the daily membership or daily attendance for that pupil is greater than 1.0, the sum shall be reduced to 1.0 and shall be apportioned between the public school and the charter school based on the percentage of total time that the pupil is enrolled or in attendance in the public school and the charter school.  The uniform system of financial records shall include guidelines to apportion the pupil enrollment and attendance as provided in this section.

D. Charter schools are allowed to accept grants and gifts to supplement their state funding, but it is not the intent of the charter school law to require taxpayers to pay twice to educate the same pupils.  The base support level for a charter school or for a school district sponsoring a charter school shall be reduced by an amount equal to the total amount of monies received by a charter school from a federal or state agency if the federal or state monies are intended for the basic maintenance and operations of the school. The superintendent of public instruction shall estimate the amount of the reduction for the budget year and shall revise the reduction to reflect the actual amount before May 15 of the current year. If the reduction results in a negative amount, the negative amount shall be used in computing all budget limits and equalization assistance, except that:

1. Equalization assistance shall not be less than zero.

2. For a charter school sponsored by the state board of education, the state board for charter schools, a university, a community college district or a group of community college districts, the total of the base support level and the charter additional assistance shall not be less than zero.

E. If a charter school was a district public school in the prior year and sponsored by the state board of education, the state board for charter schools, a university, a community college district or a group of community college districts, the reduction in subsection D of this section applies. The reduction to the base support level of the charter school shall equal the sum of the base support level and the charter additional assistance received in the current year for those pupils who were enrolled in the traditional public school in the prior year and are now enrolled in the charter school in the current year.

F. Equalization assistance for charter schools shall be provided as a single amount based on average daily membership without categorical distinctions between maintenance and operations or capital.

G. At the request of a charter school, the county school superintendent of the county where the charter school is located may provide the same educational services to the charter school as prescribed in section 15-308, subsection A. The county school superintendent may charge a fee to recover costs for providing educational services to charter schools.

H. If the sponsor of the charter school determines at a public meeting that the charter school is not in compliance with federal law, with the laws of this state or with its charter, the sponsor of a charter school may submit a request to the department of education to withhold up to ten percent of the monthly apportionment of state aid that would otherwise be due the charter school. The department shall adjust the charter school's apportionment accordingly. The sponsor shall provide written notice to the charter school at least seventy-two hours before the meeting and shall allow the charter school to respond to the allegations of noncompliance at the meeting before the sponsor makes a final determination to notify the department of education of noncompliance. The charter school shall submit a corrective action plan to the sponsor on a date specified by the sponsor at the meeting. The corrective action plan shall be designed to correct deficiencies at the charter school and to ensure that the charter school promptly returns to compliance.  When the sponsor determines that the charter school is in compliance, the department shall restore the full amount of state aid payments to the charter school.

I. In addition to the withholding of state aid payments pursuant to subsection H of this section, the sponsor of a charter school may impose a civil penalty of $1,000 per occurrence if a charter school fails to comply with the fingerprinting requirements prescribed in section 15-183, subsection C or section 15-512. The sponsor of a charter school shall not impose a civil penalty if it is the first time the charter school is out of compliance with the fingerprinting requirements and if the charter school provides proof within forty-eight hours after written notification that an application for the appropriate fingerprint check has been received by the department of public safety. The sponsor of the charter school shall obtain proof that the charter school has been notified, and the notification shall identify the date of the deadline and shall be signed by both parties. The sponsor of a charter school shall automatically impose a civil penalty of $1,000 per occurrence if the sponsor determines that the charter school subsequently violates the fingerprinting requirements. Civil penalties pursuant to this subsection shall be assessed by requesting the department of education to reduce the amount of state aid that the charter school would otherwise receive by an amount equal to the civil penalty. The amount of state aid withheld shall revert to the state general fund at the end of the fiscal year.

J. A charter school may receive and spend monies distributed by the department of education pursuant to section 42-5029, subsection E, section 42-5029.02, subsection A and section 37-521, subsection B.

K. If a school district transports or contracts to transport pupils to the Arizona state schools for the deaf and the blind during any fiscal year, the school district may transport or contract with a charter school to transport sensory impaired pupils during that same fiscal year to a charter school if requested by the parent of the pupil and if the distance from the pupil's place of actual residence within the school district to the charter school is less than the distance from the pupil's place of actual residence within the school district to the campus of the Arizona state schools for the deaf and the blind.

L. Notwithstanding any other law, a university under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents, a community college district or a group of community college districts shall not include any student in the student count of the university, community college district or group of community college districts for state funding purposes if that student is enrolled in and attending a charter school sponsored by the university, community college district or group of community college districts.

M. The governing body of a charter school shall transmit a copy of its proposed budget or the summary of the proposed budget and a notice of the public hearing to the department of education for posting on the department of education's website not later than ten days before the hearing and meeting. If the charter school maintains a website, the charter school governing body shall post on its website a copy of its proposed budget or the summary of the proposed budget and a notice of the public hearing.

N. The governing body of a charter school shall collaborate with the private organization that is approved by the state board of education pursuant to section 15-792.02 to provide approved board examination systems for the charter school.

O. If allowed by federal law, a charter school may opt out of federal grant opportunities if the charter holder or the appropriate governing body of the charter school determines that the federal requirements impose unduly burdensome reporting requirements.

P. For the purposes of this section, "monies intended for the basic maintenance and operations of the school" means monies intended to provide support for the educational program of the school, except that it does not include supplemental assistance for a specific purpose or title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 monies. The auditor general shall determine which federal or state monies meet this definition.

#### Section 15-185.01. Charter school pupils attending career technical education districts; average daily membership calculation

Notwithstanding section 15-185, subsection C, if a pupil is enrolled in both a charter school and a career technical education district and resides within the boundaries of a school district participating in the career technical education district, the average daily membership for that pupil shall be calculated in the same manner prescribed for a pupil who is enrolled in both the member school district and a career technical education district pursuant to section 15-393.

#### Section 15-186. Pupil disciplinary procedures; notification

Each charter school governing body shall develop procedures that require the charter school to annually report to the department of education in a manner prescribed by the department the number of suspensions and expulsions that involve the possession, use or sale of an illegal substance under title 13, chapter 34 and the type of illegal substance involved in each suspension or expulsion. The department of education shall compile this information and annually post the information on its website. The information shall not include personally identifiable information, shall comply with the family educational rights and privacy act of 1974 (P.L. 93-380; 88 Stat. 57; 20 United States Code section 1232g) and shall show the number of suspensions and expulsions associated with each illegal substance aggregated statewide and by county.

 

#### Section 15-186.01. Parental notification; immunity

A.

The governing board of a common school district that is located within a high school district shall notify and obtain permission from the governing board of the high school district before taking any action that results in the expansion or reduction of the common school district's boundaries. The notification and permission required by this section shall take place at least ninety days before the beginning of the fiscal year in which the proposed expansion or reduction is scheduled to take effect.

#### Section 15-445. Residents of unorganized territory; school district elections

A. The county school superintendent, on receiving notification from the state school superintendent pursuant to section 15-825.02, subsection B, shall do all of the following before calling an election:

1. Establish the boundaries of the proposed school district, taking into consideration communities of interest and excluding Indian reservations and other federal lands where reasonable to do so.  During the period that the county school superintendent is considering the new school district boundaries, the county school superintendent shall conduct at least two public meetings at which public testimony is heard and questions are answered.

2. Identify adjacent school districts that accept at least twenty-five per cent of their open enrollment or certificate of educational convenience students from the unorganized territory and that are willing to accept the unorganized territory into the existing school district. If there is only one adjacent school district that meets these criteria, the boundaries of that school district shall be reestablished to include the unorganized territory without an election.

3. If there is more than one adjacent school district that meets the criteria prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection, prepare a pamphlet and a ballot question that includes the proposed boundaries and identifies existing adjacent school districts that are willing to accept the unorganized territory into the existing school district.  The pamphlet shall be mailed to each household with one or more qualified electors. The pamphlet and ballot shall require the voters within the boundaries proposed by the county school superintendent to join an existing adjacent school district. The pamphlet and ballot shall include the full cash value, the assessed valuation and the estimated amount of the primary property taxes and the estimated amount of the secondary property taxes under each of the ballot options for each of the following:

(a) An owner occupied residence whose assessed valuation is the average assessed valuation of property classified as class three, as prescribed by section 42-12003 for the current year in the school district.

(b) An owner occupied residence whose assessed valuation is one-half of the assessed valuation of the residence in subdivision (a).

(c) An owner occupied residence whose assessed valuation is twice the assessed valuation of the residence in subdivision (a).

(d) A business whose assessed valuation is the average of the assessed valuation of property classified as class one, as prescribed by section 42-12001, paragraphs 12 and 13 for the current year in the school district.

B. The county school superintendent shall schedule the election on the next available general election date allowed by law.

C. On a canvass of the vote and a determination by the county school superintendent that a majority of the voters approve joining an existing adjacent school district, the county school superintendent shall notify the existing school district of the following:

1. That the boundaries of the school district shall be revised to include the property identified in the boundaries established by the county school superintendent.

2. That the school district shall provide the same educational services that are currently provided to students who reside in current boundaries of the school district to all students within the revised boundaries at the beginning of the next school year.

D. If the adjacent school district is a common school district that is within the boundaries of a union high school district, the unorganized territory shall join both the common school district and the union high school district.  If the adjacent school district is a common school district that is not within the boundaries of a high school district, the unorganized territory shall join the common school district, and high school pupils who reside in the previously unorganized territory shall be educated in the same manner as high school pupils who reside in the common school district.

 

#### Section 15-447. Offer of instruction in high school subjects by common school districts; limitations

The state board of education may grant permission to the governing board of a common school district to offer instruction in high school subjects, grades nine through twelve, except that the state board shall not grant permission if the qualified electors of a common school district have voted against the formation of a high school district within the last five years. If the qualified electors of a common school district vote against the formation of a high school district within one year after the state board has granted permission to the governing board to offer instruction in high school subjects, the governing board shall cease to offer instruction in high school subjects at the end of the current year and shall not offer such instruction until such time as the state board has again granted permission in accordance with this section. Enrollment of pupils in grades nine through twelve shall be deemed to be enrollment in high school. For purposes of computing the base support level, the support level weight for high school districts shall be used. Successful completion of a prescribed course of study in grades nine through twelve entitles a pupil to a certificate of high school graduation.

#### Section 15-447.01. Common school districts; offer of instruction in grade nine

A. Before a common school district offers instruction in grade nine pursuant to section 15-901, subsection A, paragraph 3, subdivision (b), the common school district governing board shall:

1. Conduct a preliminary vote at a public meeting to consider the question of offering instruction in grade nine.

2. Send a letter expressing the common school district's interest in offering instruction in grade nine to the union high school district or the unified school district where a majority of the common school pupils would otherwise enroll in grade nine.

3. Hold a public hearing on the issue at least ninety days after the letter of interest is sent as prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

4. Conduct a final vote on the issue of offering instruction in grade nine.  The final vote prescribed in this paragraph shall occur no later than January 15 of the school year that precedes the school year in which instruction in grade nine will first be offered and at least thirty days after the public hearing prescribed in paragraph 3 of this subsection.

B. Notwithstanding any other law, a common school district that offers instruction in grade nine pursuant to section 15-901, subsection A, paragraph 3, subdivision (b) may:

1. Conduct an election to exceed the revenue control limit as provided in sections 15-481 and 15-482 and use the weighted student count of pupils in grade nine as part of the calculation for the increase in the revenue control limit.

2. Use the count of pupils in grade nine to determine equalization assistance pursuant to section 15-971.

C. A common school district may not offer instruction in grade nine in a school facility where instruction is provided to pupils in kindergarten programs and grades one through six, or any combination of kindergarten instruction or grades one through six.

 

#### Section 15-448. Formation of unified school district; board membership; budget

 

(L20, Ch. 14, sec. 2.  Eff. until 7/1/23)

 

A. One or more common school districts and a high school district with coterminous or overlapping boundaries may establish a unified school district pursuant to this section. Unification of a common school district and a high school district is not authorized by this section if any of the high school facilities owned by the new unified school district would not be located within its boundaries.

B. Formation of a unified school district shall be by resolutions approved by the governing boards of the unifying school districts and certification of approval by such governing boards to the county school superintendent of the county or counties in which such individual school districts are located.  A common school district and high school district that unify pursuant to this section shall not exclude from the same unification a common school district that has overlapping boundaries with the high school district and that wishes to unify. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, the formation of a unified school district becomes effective on July 1 of the next fiscal year following the certification of the county school superintendent.  An election is not required to form a unified school district pursuant to this section. Notice of the proposed vote of the governing boards on the resolutions prescribed in this subsection shall be posted in at least three public places in each of the school districts proposed to be unified at least ninety days before the proposed vote. At least ninety days before the governing boards vote on the resolutions prescribed in this subsection, the governing boards shall mail a pamphlet to each household with one or more qualified electors that lists the full cash value, the assessed valuation and the estimated amount of the primary property taxes and the estimated amount of the secondary property taxes under the proposed unification for each of the following:

1. An owner-occupied residence whose assessed valuation is the average assessed valuation of property classified as class three, as prescribed by section 42-12003 for the current year in the school district.

2. An owner-occupied residence whose assessed valuation is one-half of the assessed valuation of the residence in paragraph 1 of this subsection.

4. A business whose assessed valuation is the average of the assessed valuation of property classified as class one, as prescribed by section 42-12001, paragraphs 12 and 13 for the current year in the school district.

C. The boundaries of the unified school district shall be the boundaries of the former common school district or districts that unify.  The boundaries of the common school district or districts that are not unifying remain unchanged.  The county school superintendent, immediately on receipt of the approved resolutions prescribed by subsection B of this section, shall file with the board of supervisors, the county assessor and the superintendent of public instruction a transcript of the boundaries of the unified school district. The boundaries shown in the transcript shall become the legal boundaries of the school districts on July 1 of the next fiscal year.

D. On formation of the unified school district, the governing board consists of the members of the former school district governing boards and the members shall hold office until January 1 following the first general election after formation of the district.  For the purpose of all actions that are necessary to operate the unified district for the next year, the unified school district governing board is constituted and may conduct meetings after the adoption of the unification resolutions prescribed by subsection B of this section.

E. Beginning on January 1 following the first general election after formation of the unified school district, the governing board shall have five members.  At the first general election after the formation of the district, members shall be elected in the following manner:

1. The three candidates receiving the highest, the second highest and the third highest number of votes shall be elected to four-year terms.

2. The two candidates receiving the fourth and fifth highest number of votes shall be elected to two-year terms. Thereafter all offices shall have four-year terms.

F. The new unified school district may appoint a resident of the remaining common school district to serve as a nonvoting member of the governing board to represent the interests of the high school pupils who reside in the remaining common school district and who attend school in the unified school district.

G. For the first year of operation, the unified school district governing board shall prepare a consolidated budget based on the student counts from the school districts comprising the unified school district, except that for purposes of determining budget amounts and equalization assistance, the student count for the former high school district shall not include the prior year average daily membership attributable to high school pupils from a common school district that was part of the former high school district but is not part of the unified school district.  The unified school district shall charge the remaining common school district tuition for these pupils as provided in subsection J of this section. The unified school district may budget for unification assistance pursuant to section 15-912.01.

H. The governing board of the unified school district shall prepare policies, curricula and budgets for the district. These policies shall require that:

1. The base compensation of each certificated teacher for the first year of operation of the new unified school district shall not be lower than the certificated teacher's base compensation for the prior year in the previously existing school districts.

2. The certificated teacher's years of employment in the previously existing school districts shall be included in determining the teacher's certificated years of employment in the new unified school district.

I. On formation of a unified school district, any existing override authorization of the former high school district and the former common school district or districts shall continue until expiration based on the revenue control limit of the school district or districts that had override authorization before unification. The unified school district may request new override authorization for the budget year as provided in section 15-481 based on the combined revenue control limit of the new district after unification. If the unified school district's request for override authorization is approved, it will replace any existing override for the budget year.

J. The unified school district shall admit high school pupils who reside in a common school district that was located within the boundaries of the former high school district.  Tuition shall be paid to the unified school district by the common school district in which such pupils reside. Such tuition amount shall be calculated in accordance with section 15-824, subject to the following modifications:

1. If the former high school district had outstanding bonded indebtedness at the time of unification, the combined tuition for the group of high school pupils who reside in each common school district shall include a debt service amount for the former high school district's outstanding bonded indebtedness that is determined as follows:

(a) Divide the total net assessed valuation of the common school district in which the group of pupils resides by the total net assessed valuation of the former high school district. For the purposes of this subdivision, "net assessed valuation" means net assessed valuation for the tax year before the year when the unified school district governing board is constituted pursuant to subsection D of this section and includes the values used to determine voluntary contributions collected pursuant to title 9, chapter 4, article 3 and title 48, chapter 1, article 8.

(b) Multiply the quotient obtained in subdivision (a) of this paragraph by the unified school district's annual debt service expenditure.

2. The debt service portion of such tuition payments calculated pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be used exclusively for debt service of the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the former high school district. When such indebtedness is fully extinguished, the debt service portion of a pupil's tuition shall be determined in accordance with paragraph 3 of this subsection.

3. If the former high school district had no outstanding bonded indebtedness at the time of unification, the tuition calculation shall include the actual school district expenditures for the portion of any debt service of the unified school district that pertains to any construction or renovation of high school facilities divided by the school district's student count for the high school portion of the school district.

4. The unified school district shall not include in the tuition calculation any debt service that pertains to any construction or renovation of school facilities for preschool through grade eight.

5. Notwithstanding section 15-951, subsection F, the revenue control limit of the common school district shall include the full amount of the debt service portion of the tuition calculated pursuant to this subsection.

K. All assets and liabilities of the unifying school districts shall be transferred and assumed by the new unified school district.  Any existing bonded indebtedness of a common school district or a high school district unifying pursuant to this section shall be assumed by the new unified school district and shall be regarded as an indebtedness of the new unified school district for the purpose of determining the debt incurring authority of the district.  Taxes for the payment of such bonded indebtedness shall be levied on all taxable property in the new unified school district, but nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve from liability to taxation for the payment of all taxable property of the former high school district if necessary to prevent a default in the payment of any bonded indebtedness of the former high school district.  The residents of a common school district that does not unify shall not vote in bond or override elections of the unified school district and shall not be assessed taxes as a result of a bond or override election of the unified school district.

L. If the remaining common school district had authorization for an override as provided in section 15-481 or 15-482, the override authorization continues for the remaining common school district or districts in the same manner as before the formation of the unified school district.

M. The bonding authorization and bonding limitations continue for the remaining common school district or districts in the same manner as before the formation of the unified school district.

N. This section does not relieve a school district formed pursuant to section 15-457 or 15-458 of its liability for any outstanding bonded indebtedness.

0. For school districts that become unified after July 1, 2004 and where all of the common schools were eligible for the small school district weight pursuant to section 15-943, paragraph 1, subdivision (a) when computing their base support level and base revenue control limit before unification, the unified school district may continue to use the small school district weight as follows:

1. Annually determine the common school student count and the weighted student count pursuant to section 15-943, paragraph 1, subdivision (a) for each common school district before unification.

2. Calculate the sum of the common school districts' student counts and weighted student counts determined in paragraph 1 of this subsection.

3. Divide the sum of the weighted student counts by the sum of the student counts determined in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

4. The amount determined in paragraph 3 of this subsection shall be the weight for the common schools in the unified school district.

P. A unified school district may calculate its revenue control limit and district support level by using subsection O of this section as follows:

1. Determine the number of individual school districts that existed before unification into a single school district.

2. Multiply the amount determined in paragraph 1 of this subsection by six hundred.

3. Multiply the amount determined in paragraph 2 of this subsection by 0.80.

4. If the amount determined in paragraph 3 of this subsection exceeds the student count of the unified school district, the unified school district is eligible to use subsection O of this section.

Q. Subsections O and P of this section shall remain in effect until the aggregate student count of the common school districts before unification exceeds the aggregate number of students of the common school districts before unification authorized to utilize section 15-943, paragraph 1, subdivision (a).

#### Section 15-450. Formation of a new joint unified school district; petition; report; election; notice; ballots; canvass of votes; appointment of governing board

A. Notwithstanding any other statute, a new joint unified school district may be formed if the formation is approved by the state board of education and if the following requirements are met:

1. The boundaries of the proposed new joint unified school district include an incorporated city that is divided by two counties.

2. The proposed new joint unified school district includes territory within the boundaries of two or more existing school districts.

3. The proposed new joint unified school district would have a student count of not less than six hundred.

4. A high school is not located within the boundaries of the proposed new joint unified school district.

5. The assessed valuation of the proposed school district is at least two million dollars.

6. The governing boards of the districts affected have been given notice of the proposed change and an opportunity to be heard pursuant to section 15-442, subsection B.

B. If it is desired that a new joint unified school district be formed pursuant to the provisions of this section, ten per cent or more of the qualified electors residing within the boundaries of the proposed joint unified school district shall file petitions with the county school superintendents of the counties in which the territory of the proposed district is situated. The petitions shall describe the territory to be included in the proposed joint unified school district and shall request that the formation of the proposed district be submitted to the qualified electors who reside within the proposed district.

C. Each county school superintendent with whom petitions for the formation of a joint unified school district are filed shall examine the petitions within fifteen days of the date of receipt to determine their sufficiency, including the adequacy of the signatures from the portion of the proposed district within his county. If the petitions are found sufficient, the county school superintendent shall transmit the petitions to the state board of education.

D. The state board of education shall promptly schedule a review of the issue of the formation of the proposed joint unified school district after receiving the petitions from the county school superintendents pursuant to subsection C of this section. The board shall approve or reject the formation of the proposed joint unified school district within sixty days of the date of receipt of the petitions. The board shall consider:

1. Operational costs of the existing and proposed districts.

2. Travel times and distances.

3. Climatic conditions.

4. Local terrain.

5. The number of pupils.

6. The fairness and appropriateness of any redistribution of taxable wealth from an existing school district to a proposed joint unified school district.

7. Whether the assessed valuation of the proposed joint unified school district is sufficient to support the district in a manner comparable to other districts of similar size.

If the state board after considering all such factors determines that the proposed new district will not cause an undue adverse effect on the operations of any existing school district, jeopardize the operation of the proposed joint common school district or cause a disproportionate amount of taxable wealth to be redistributed, it shall approve the petitions and return them to the respective county school superintendents.

E. On approval from the state board of education, the county school superintendent of each county whose territory or a portion of whose territory will be included in the proposed joint unified school district shall submit the question of the formation of the proposed joint unified school district to the voters at a general election or at a special election to be held for that purpose. If no general election is scheduled to be held within sixty days after the date the county school superintendent receives the approved petitions from the state board of education, he shall promptly call a special election to be held within sixty days after receipt of the approved petitions. Notice of the election shall be given by the county school superintendent to the boards of supervisors. At least ten days before the election, the county school superintendent shall cause notice of the proposed election to be posted in not less than three public places in the proposed district and to be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the proposed district. The notice shall state the following:

1. The question to be voted on and the boundaries of the proposed joint unified school district with sufficient definiteness to make them readily ascertainable.

2. A description of voter qualifications, including requirements that the voters shall be residents of the proposed district.

3. The location of voting places within the proposed district, at least one of which shall be in each county.

F. Within ten days after the election, the county school superintendent and the chairman of the board of supervisors of each county shall canvass the vote. If a majority of the votes cast in each county of persons who reside within the proposed district favors formation of the proposed joint unified school district, the boards of supervisors shall jointly declare the election and the joint unified school district shall become operative from and after June 30 next following the election.

G. If the joint unified school district includes territory located in two or more counties, the county of jurisdiction is the county in which the largest number of qualified electors of the joint unified school district resides, except that if all of the existing school buildings are located in one county, that county is the county of jurisdiction. The county school superintendent of the jurisdictional county shall perform all duties for and with respect to the joint unified school district required to be performed by county school superintendents. The board of supervisors of the jurisdictional county shall perform all duties for and with respect to the joint unified school district required to be performed by boards of supervisors, except that school district taxes to be levied on property in the portion of the joint unified school district lying in another county shall be levied by the board of supervisors of the other county or counties and on receipt shall be transferred to the county of jurisdiction.

A. A petition for the creation of a joint common school district shall include the following:

1. A description of the territory comprising the proposed district.

2. A request that the question of the creation of the proposed district be submitted to the qualified electors residing within each of the affected districts.

3. The signatures of not less than ten per cent of the qualified electors residing within the portion of the proposed district within the respective county involved. The county school superintendent of each county whose territory, or a portion thereof, will be included in the proposed district shall receive the petitions containing signatures of residents of his county.

B. Each county school superintendent with whom a petition for the creation of a joint common school district is filed shall, within fifteen days of the date of receipt, examine the petition to determine its sufficiency including the adequacy of the signatures from the portion of the proposed district within his county. If the petition is found sufficient, the county school superintendent shall transmit the petition to the state board of education.

C. If the petitions for the creation of the proposed joint common school district are found sufficient by the county school superintendent of each county whose territory or a portion thereof is to be included in the proposed district, the state board of education shall promptly schedule a review of the issue of the creation of the proposed joint common school district. Such review and the board determination on the issue of the creation of the proposed joint common school district shall be completed within sixty days of the date of receipt of the final petition.

D. The review of the issue of the creation of a proposed joint common school district shall include consideration of the following factors:

1. Operational costs.

2. Travel times and distances.

3. Climatic conditions.

4. Local terrain.

5. Number of pupils.

6. The fairness and appropriateness of any redistribution of taxable wealth from an existing school district to a proposed joint common school district. If the state board after considering all such factors determines that the proposed new district will not cause an undue adverse effect on the operations of any existing school district or jeopardize the operation of the proposed joint common school district or cause a disproportionate amount of taxable wealth to be redistributed, it shall approve the petitions and return them to the respective county school superintendents.

E. Upon receipt of the approved petitions the county school superintendent of each county whose territory, or a portion thereof, will be included in the proposed joint common school district shall submit the question of the formation of the proposed joint common school district at a general election, or at a special election to be held for that purpose. If no general election will be held within sixty days after the date the county school superintendent receives the approved petition from the state board of education, he shall promptly call a special election to be held within forty-five days after receipt of the approved petition. Notice of such election shall be given by the county school superintendent to the boards of supervisors.

F. The county school superintendent shall cause notice of the proposed election to be posted in not less than three public places in the area within each of the affected districts and to be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in each county, such posting and publication to be made at least ten days before the election. Such notice shall state the following:

1. The question to be voted on and the boundaries of the proposed joint common school district with sufficient definiteness to make them readily ascertainable.

Ballots shall be prepared and the officers of election appointed by the county school superintendent.

G. On the fifth day after the election the county school superintendent and the chairman of the board of supervisors of each county shall canvass the vote. If a majority of the votes cast in each county of persons who reside within each of the affected districts is in favor of creation of the proposed joint common school district, the boards of supervisors shall jointly declare the election and the joint common school district is established. For the purpose of this subsection a majority of the votes cast in each county of persons who reside within each of the affected districts means a majority vote of the qualified electors voting in each county in each part of an affected existing school district or affected area to be included in the proposed joint common school district and a majority vote of the qualified electors voting in each county in each part, if any, of an affected school district not to be included in the proposed joint common school district.

#### Section 15-456. Jurisdiction of county board of supervisors and county school superintendent over joint common school district

A. The county of jurisdiction of the proposed joint common school district is that county in which the greater portion of the qualified electors of the proposed joint common school district resides, unless all of the existing school buildings located on territory which will be within the proposed joint common school district are in one county, in which event that county shall be the county of jurisdiction.

B. The jurisdictional county of the joint common school district shall exercise authority as provided for in this section and sections 15-429, 15-453 through 15-455, 15-457, 15-491, subsection B, 15-975 and 15-997. The county school superintendent of the jurisdictional county shall perform for and in respect to the joint common school district all duties required to be performed by county school superintendents. The board of supervisors of the same county shall have jurisdiction over and perform all duties for and with respect to the joint common school district as required to be performed by boards of supervisors, except that school district taxes to be levied on property in the portion of the joint common school district lying in another county shall be levied by the board of supervisors of such other county.

#### Section 15-457. Formation of new joint common school district by subdivision of existing school district; effect on bonded indebtedness; transfer of property

A. Any territory incorporated into a joint common school district which is at the time of the creation of such joint common school district part of an existing school district shall thereafter be considered detached from the existing school district.

B. If any such existing school district has outstanding bonded indebtedness, liability for the payment of principal of and interest on such bonded indebtedness shall be prorated between the existing school district and the new joint common school district in the same proportion as the assessed valuation of taxable property in the existing school district bears to the assessed valuation of taxable property in the detached territory, such valuations to be determined according to the assessment rolls of the county in which the existing school district is located, as such rolls exist at the time of the creation of the new joint common school district. Taxes for the payment of such portion of the principal and interest shall be levied on all taxable property in the new joint common school district, but nothing in this subsection shall be construed to relieve from liability to taxation for the payment thereof all taxable property in the theretofore existing school district if necessary to prevent a default in such payment. Voter approval of the creation of the joint common school district shall constitute an approval of such assumption of indebtedness.

C. All school buildings located in the detached territory, as provided in this subsection, together with all equipment and furnishings, shall become the property of the new joint common school district, and the intangible property of the existing school district shall be prorated between the two districts on the same basis used to determine the amount of bonded indebtedness to be assumed.

D. Any assumed indebtedness shall be regarded as an indebtedness of the new joint common school district for the purpose of determining the debt incurring authority of the new joint common school district and the existing school district.

#### Section 15-458. Formation of new district or districts by subdivision of existing district; division of assets

A. In a school district containing a student count of more than six hundred, a new school district or districts may be formed by a subdivision of the existing school district.

B. On the request of the governing board or on receipt of petitions bearing the signatures of at least ten per cent of the qualified electors in the area proposed to be a new school district or the signatures of at least fifty of the qualified electors in the area proposed to be a new school district, whichever is more, and at least ten per cent of the qualified electors in the area proposed to continue as the existing school district or at least fifty signatures of the qualified electors in the area proposed to continue as the existing school district, whichever is more, the county school superintendent shall within ten days call an election to determine if the existing school district should be divided and a new school district or districts formed, except that if the existing school district is a union high school district, the county school superintendent shall call the election only on the request of the governing boards of the union high school district and each of the common school districts comprising the union high school district or on receipt of petitions bearing the signatures of at least ten per cent of the qualified electors in each of the common school districts or at least fifty signatures of the qualified electors in each of the common school districts, whichever is more. This subsection does not require the submission of the signatures of more than fifty per cent of the qualified electors of the existing school district to the county school superintendent in order to call an election for the purposes of this section. The petition shall state the proposed boundaries of the school district or districts to be formed together with the student count, specific reasons why it is in the best interest of the current district residents to have a new district or districts formed and the amount of real property valuation within the school district or districts to be formed. No new school district may be formed unless the state board of education determines that the real property valuation per student count is sufficient to support the school district in a manner comparable to other school districts of similar size and that a sufficient number of pupils will exist in each of the new districts to ensure that educational programs and services will be of similar or better quality after the subdivision.

C. The election shall be held concurrently and as provided in section 15-459, except that a majority of the votes cast by the qualified electors in each of the areas proposed as a school district must approve the division of the existing school district and the formation of the new school district.

D. The governing board of the existing school district shall prepare a projected list of assets for the existing district prior to the end of the fiscal year in which the election is held. The governing boards of the original and new school district or districts shall prepare a final statement of assets for the formerly existing school district as of the end of the fiscal year in which the election was held and shall have the statement of cash and bonded indebtedness certified by the county treasurer by August 30 of the year in which the new school district or districts become operative. The governing boards of the original school district and the new school district or districts shall set aside sufficient assets or provide other means to satisfy the liabilities of the former existing district except for bonded indebtedness and approve the final division of all assets by September 15 of the year in which the new school district or districts become operative. If one or more of the governing boards fail to provide for satisfying the liabilities and fail to approve the division of assets by September 15, the county attorney shall determine the means to satisfy the liabilities and final division of assets by October 1 of the fiscal year in which the new school district or districts become operative.

E. The division of the bonded indebtedness of the original school district shall be in accordance with the provisions of section 15-457, subsection B.

F. An original or new school district formed by a subdivision of an existing school district or districts after June 30, 1992 is not eligible to determine its budget using the provisions of section 15-949 or the support level weights prescribed in section 15-943, paragraph 1. These districts are also not eligible to participate in a small district service program as prescribed in section 15-365 or to apply to the state board of education for a capital levy adjustment as prescribed in section 15-963.

G. If two or more common school districts are within the boundaries of a union high school district, two or more unified school districts may be formed by a subdivision of the existing union high school district and by unification with the common school districts as provided in this section, subject to the following provisions:

1. Formation of a unified school district pursuant to this subsection shall be initiated if a majority of the governing board members of each of the districts affected unites in a petition to the county school superintendent for the establishment of a unified school district or if ten per cent of the number of qualified electors who voted in whichever of the last two general elections resulted in the higher number of ballots cast and who reside in each of the areas proposed to be the new unified school districts unite in a petition to the county school superintendent for the establishment of a unified school district. The petition shall include a statement of the proposed boundaries of the new unified school districts and shall request that the subdivision of the union high school district and formation of the unified districts be submitted to the qualified electors who reside within the proposed districts. The petition shall also include a detailed description of desegregation funding and expenses for the resulting school district as set forth in paragraph 7 of this subsection and may include the new school district name and other information as desirable. On receipt of the petitions, the county school superintendent shall examine the petitions within fifteen days of receipt to determine their sufficiency including the adequacy of the signatures of electors. If the petitions are found sufficient, the county school superintendent shall call an election to be held to determine the question. The county school superintendent shall prepare and the governing board shall distribute a subdivision and unification plan that includes:

(a) The proposed boundary changes.

(b) The impact of the proposed boundary changes, including where pupils will attend school, changes in pupil transportation services, changes in availability of special education services, changes in pupil-teacher ratio and operational costs.

(c) If paragraph 7 of this subsection applies to one or more of the existing school districts, a detailed description of desegregation funding and expenses for the resulting school districts as set forth in paragraph 7 of this subsection.

(d) Any other information the county school superintendent deems appropriate to include.

2. If the governing boards or the petitioners wish the new districts to receive unification assistance as provided in section 15-912.01, they shall notify the department of education and the joint legislative budget committee by August 1 of the fiscal year before the new districts would begin operation and provide the department and the joint legislative budget committee with information required to project the costs of unification assistance to the new districts for the first year of operation. The department shall include sufficient monies to cover these unification costs in its budget request for state aid for the following fiscal year.

3. The election shall be held as provided in section 15-459, except that the ballot shall contain the words "subdivision and unification, yes" and "subdivision and unification, no", and there shall be one of the following two ballot questions, whichever is applicable, stated as follows:

(a) Should (insert the name of the district) union high school district be subdivided with boundaries identical to the boundaries of (insert the name of the districts) common school districts and simultaneously creating (insert the number of the districts) unified school districts with the respective common school districts as specified in the subdivision and unification plan?

(b) Should (insert the name of the district) union high school district be subdivided simultaneously with the subdivision of (insert the name of the districts) common school districts and simultaneously creating (insert the number of the districts) unified school districts with the subdivided common school districts as specified in the subdivision and unification plan?

4. If the formation of the new unified school districts is authorized, the terms of the governing board members of the common and union high school districts do not expire on the effective date of unification but continue until January 1 following the next general election, during which time the members of the governing boards of the previously existing school districts shall serve as the governing board of the new school district in which they reside. At the next general election held after the formation and thereafter, members shall be elected as prescribed in section 15-448, subsection E. The governing boards of the new unified school districts shall prepare policies, curricula and budgets for the new unified school districts. The policies prepared by the governing boards shall include the provisions of section 15-459, subsection M.

5. If the common school district is not subdivided, the new unified school district that includes the boundaries of the previously existing common school district shall assume the bonded indebtedness of that previously existing common school district. If the common school district is subdivided, the provisions of subsection E of this section shall apply.

6. If the common school district is not subdivided, existing bond authorization of the common school districts automatically continues for the original purpose authorized. If the common school district is subdivided, the existing bond authorization of the common school district will expire unless it is divided between the new unified school districts as specified in the subdivision and unification plan.

7. If any of the school districts were authorized to budget for expenses of complying with or continuing to implement activities that were required or permitted by court order of desegregation or administrative agreement with the United States department of education office for civil rights directed towards remediating alleged or proven racial discrimination pursuant to section 15-910, this authorization does not expire on the effective date of the subdivision and unification but only applies to schools included in the court order or administrative agreement.

8. If the union high school district and the common school district or districts with which it is unified all have authorization for an override as provided in section 15-481 that would have continued after the subdivision and unification, the override authorization continues for the new district and expires at the time that the earliest override would have expired.

9. If one or more of the previously existing school districts were participating in a career ladder program pursuant to chapter 9, article 1.1 of this title before subdivision and unification, notwithstanding any other law the state board shall expedite the processing of and may approve an updated application for program reapproval for the new school district that includes the existing school district that was participating in the program.

10. The employee's years of employment in the previously existing school district shall be included in determining the employee's years of employment in the new school district after a subdivision and unification. An employee who was entitled to continuing contract status in the previously existing school district is entitled to continuing employment contract status in the new school district.

11. The base salary and benefits of each employee for the first year of operation of the new school district after a subdivision and unification shall not be lower than the employee's base salary and benefits for the prior year in the previously existing school district.

12. Notwithstanding paragraphs 10 and 11 of this subsection and pursuant to section 15-544, nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the ability of the governing board to implement a reduction in force or to scale back salaries of certified teachers, administrators or noncertificated employees for reasons of economy or to improve the efficient conduct of schools within the district following a subdivision and unification.

#### Section 15-459. Consolidation of districts; petition; election; notice; report; ballots; canvass of votes; governing board

A. On the request of the governing boards of two or more school districts in the same county or in adjacent counties or on receipt of petitions bearing the signatures of ten percent or more of the number of qualified electors who voted in whichever of the last two general elections resulted in the higher number of ballots cast and who reside in each of two or more school districts in the same county or in adjacent counties to consolidate the school districts or parts of the districts, the county school superintendent of each of the counties affected, within ten days, shall call an election to determine the question on consolidation.

B. Consolidations allowed pursuant to subsection A of this section include:

1. To change the boundaries of a school district to include any part of an adjacent school district.

2. If all the common school districts within the boundaries of an existing union high school district desire to consolidate into one common school district.

3. If two or more adjacent school districts of the same type, both or all being common, union high or unified school districts, desire to consolidate into one common, union high or unified school district.

4. If a common school district that is not a part of a union high school district desires to consolidate with an adjacent unified school district.

5. If two or more common school districts desire to consolidate into one school district and unify the consolidated district with a union high school district to form one unified school district.

6. To change the boundaries of a school district that has received a letter grade of A or B pursuant to section 15-241 to include another school district within twenty miles.

Yes ( ) No ( )."

I. The county school superintendent shall hold the election during the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year consolidation is proposed to be effective on a date prescribed by section 16-204.  The election shall be held in the manner and electors shall possess qualifications as prescribed for the election of governing board members.  The results of the election shall be reported to the county school superintendent.

J. The county school superintendent and the chairman of the board of supervisors, on the seventh day after the election, shall canvass the vote. If a majority of the votes cast in each district approved the consolidation, the districts are consolidated and become one district from and after June 30 next following the election.  If parts of two or more school districts are proposed to be consolidated, a majority of the voters in the part of a school district or districts not included in the proposed consolidation and a majority of the voters in the part of the school district or districts proposed for consolidation must approve the consolidation.

K. If the consolidated district includes territory located in two or more counties, the county of jurisdiction is the county in which the largest number of qualified electors of the consolidated school district resides, except that if all of the existing school buildings are in one county, that county is the county of jurisdiction. The county school superintendent of the jurisdictional county shall perform all duties for and with respect to the consolidated school district as required to be performed by county school superintendents.  The board of supervisors of the jurisdictional county shall perform all duties for and with respect to the consolidated school district as required to be performed by boards of supervisors, except that school district taxes to be levied on property in the portion of the consolidated school district lying in another county shall be levied by the board of supervisors of the other county or counties and on receipt shall be transferred to the county of jurisdiction. All school buildings located within the consolidated school district, together with all equipment and furnishings, become the property of the consolidated school district. Any assumed indebtedness is an indebtedness of the consolidated school district for the purpose of determining the debt incurring authority of the consolidated school district.

L. Consolidation pursuant to this section is not allowed if the resulting school district would have a student count for the current year of more than ten percent of the total student count of all school districts in this state.

M. The governing board is constituted, may conduct meetings and shall prepare policies, curricula and budgets for the new school district after the canvass pursuant to subsection J of this section demonstrates that a majority of the votes cast in each school district approved the consolidation.  These policies shall require that:

1. The base salary and benefits of each employee for the first year of operation of the new school district shall not be lower than the employee's base salary and benefits for the prior year in the previously existing school district.

3. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection and pursuant to section 15-544, this section does not restrict the ability of the governing board to implement a reduction in force or to scale back salaries of certified teachers, administrators or noncertificated employees for reasons of economy or to improve the efficient conduct of schools within the district following a school district consolidation.

N. If all of the districts to be consolidated have authorization for an override as provided in section 15-481 that would have continued after the consolidation, the override authorization continues for the new district and expires at the time that the earliest override would have expired.

O. If one or more, but not all, of the districts to be consolidated have authorization for an override as provided in section 15-481 that would have continued after the consolidation, the override authorization shall only apply to the schools included under the terms of the prior override authorization. Consolidation of school districts does not consolidate or pool the liability to be taxed for the override, and only property that was located within the boundaries of the district that approved the override before consolidation is to pay taxes to support the override. This subsection also applies if all of the districts to be consolidated have authorization for overrides, but the authorizations are pursuant to different subsections of section 15-481 or the override amounts are not the same percentage of the revenue control limit.

P. Notwithstanding section 15-457, consolidation of school districts does not consolidate or pool the liability of the former school districts into the resulting school district. Outstanding indebtedness incurred by a school district before consolidation shall be repaid without interruption according to existing debt schedules as determined by the county board of supervisors. If a school district consolidates after July 1, 2004, the new school district may pay tuition to the district of attendance when a pupil is precluded by distance or lack of transportation from attending school in the district of a pupil's residence.

Q.

For the purposes of this subdivision, the revenue control limit is separated into elementary and secondary components based on the weighted student count as provided in section 15-971, subsection B, paragraph 2, subdivision (a).

2. If a school district utilizes this subsection to request an override of more than one year, the ballot shall include an estimate of the amount of the proposed increase in the future years in place of the statement that the amount of the proposed increase will be based on a percentage of the school district's revenue control limit in future years, as prescribed in subsections E and F of this section.

3. Notwithstanding subsection P of this section, the maximum period of an override authorized pursuant to this subsection is five years.

4. Subsection P, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section do not apply to overrides authorized pursuant to this subsection.

I. If the election is to exceed the revenue control limit as provided in section 15-482 and if the proposed increase will be fully funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property within the school district, the ballot shall contain the words "budget increase, yes" and "budget increase, no", and the voter shall signify the voter's desired choice.  The ballot shall also contain the amount of the proposed increase of the budget over the alternate budget, a statement that the amount of the proposed increase will be based on a percentage of the school district's revenue control limit in future years, if applicable, as provided in subsection Q of this section, and the following statement:

Any budget increase authorized by this election shall be entirely funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property within this school district for the year for which adopted and for _____ subsequent years, shall not be realized from monies furnished by the state and shall not be subject to the limitation on taxes specified in article IX, section 18, Constitution of Arizona. Based on the current net assessed valuation used for secondary property tax purposes, to fund the proposed increase in the school district's budget that will be funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property within this school district would require an estimated tax rate of $__________ per $100 of net assessed valuation used for secondary property tax purposes and is in addition to the school district's tax rate that will be levied to fund the school district's revenue control limit allowed by law.

J. If the election is to exceed the revenue control limit as provided in section 15-482 and if the proposed increase will be fully funded by revenues other than a levy of taxes on the taxable property within the school district, the ballot shall contain the words "budget increase, yes" and "budget increase, no", and the voter shall signify the voter's desired choice.

K. The maximum budget increase that may be requested and authorized as provided in subsection I or J of this section, or a combination of both of these subsections, is five percent of the revenue control limit as provided in section 15-947, subsection A for the budget year. For a common school district not within a high school district or a common school district within a high school district that offers instruction in high school subjects as provided in section 15-447, five percent of the revenue control limit means five percent of the revenue control limit attributable to the weighted student count in preschool programs for children with disabilities, kindergarten programs and grades one through eight as provided in section 15-971, subsection B. For a unified school district, five percent of the revenue control limit means five percent of the revenue control limit attributable to the weighted student count in preschool programs for children with disabilities, kindergarten programs and grades one through twelve. For a union high school district, five percent of the revenue control limit means five percent of the revenue control limit attributable to the weighted student count in grades nine through twelve.

L. If the election is to exceed district additional assistance and if the proposed increase will be fully funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property within the school district, the ballot shall contain the words "budget increase, yes" and "budget increase, no", and the voter shall signify the voter's desired choice. An election held pursuant to this subsection shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November.

If the election is to exceed district additional assistance and if the proposed increase will be fully funded by revenues from other than a levy of taxes on the taxable property within the school district, the ballot shall contain the words "budget increase, yes" and "budget increase, no", and the voter shall signify the voter's desired choice.  An election held pursuant to this subsection shall be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November.  The ballot shall also contain the amount of the proposed increase of the proposed budget over the alternate budget and the following statement:

Any budget increase authorized by this election shall be entirely funded by this school district with revenues from other than a levy of taxes on the taxable property within the school district for the year in which adopted and for ______ subsequent years and shall not be realized from monies furnished by the state.

N. If the election is to exceed a combination of the revenue control limit as provided in subsection E or F of this section, the revenue control limit as provided in subsection I or J of this section or district additional assistance as provided in subsection L or M of this section, the ballot shall be prepared so that the voters may vote on each proposed increase separately and shall contain statements required in the same manner as if each proposed increase were submitted separately.

O. If the election provides for a levy of taxes on the taxable property within the school district, at least thirty days before the election, the department of revenue shall provide the school district governing board and the county school superintendent with the current net assessed valuation of the school district. The governing board and the county school superintendent shall use the current net assessed valuation of the school district to translate the amount of the proposed dollar increase in the budget of the school district over that allowed by law into a tax rate figure.

P. If the voters in a school district vote to adopt a budget in excess of the revenue control limit as provided in subsection E or F of this section, any additional increase shall be included in the aggregate budget limit for each of the years authorized. Any additional increase shall be excluded from the determination of equalization assistance. The school district governing board, however, may levy on the net assessed valuation used for secondary property tax purposes of the property in the school district the additional increase if adopted under subsection E of this section for the period of one year, two years or five through seven years as authorized.  If an additional increase is approved as provided in subsection F of this section, the school district governing board may only use revenues derived from the school district's prior year's maintenance and operation fund ending cash balance to fund the additional increase.  If a budget increase was previously authorized and will be in effect for the budget year or budget year and subsequent years, as provided in subsection E or F of this section, the governing board may request a new budget increase as provided in the same subsection under which the prior budget increase was adopted, which shall not exceed the maximum amount allowed under subsection G of this section. If the voters in the school district authorize the new budget increase amount, the existing budget increase no longer is in effect. If the voters in the school district do not authorize the budget increase amount, the existing budget increase remains in effect for the time period for which it was authorized. The maximum additional increase authorized as provided in subsection E or F of this section and the additional increase that is included in the aggregate budget limit is based on a percentage of a school district's revenue control limit in future years, if the budget increase is authorized for more than one year. If the additional increase:

1. Is for two years, the proposed increase in the second year is equal to the initial proposed percentage increase.

2. Is for five years or more, the proposed increase is equal to the initial proposed percentage increase in the following years of the proposed increase, except that in the next to last year it is two-thirds of the initial proposed percentage increase and it is one-third of the initial proposed percentage increase in the last year of the proposed increase.

If the voters in a school district vote to adopt a budget in excess of the revenue control limit as provided in subsection I or J of this section, any additional increase shall be included in the aggregate budget limit for each of the years authorized.  Any additional increase shall be excluded from the determination of equalization assistance. The school district governing board, however, may levy on the net assessed valuation used for secondary property tax purposes of the property in the school district the additional increase if adopted under subsection I of this section for the period of one year, two years or five through seven years as authorized. If an additional increase is approved as provided in subsection J of this section, the increase may only be budgeted and expended if sufficient monies are available in the maintenance and operation fund of the school district. If a budget increase was previously authorized and will be in effect for the budget year or budget year and subsequent years, as provided in subsection I or J of this section, the governing board may request a new budget increase as provided in the same subsection under which the prior budget increase was adopted that does not exceed the maximum amount permitted under subsection K of this section. If the voters in the school district authorize the new budget increase amount, the existing budget increase no longer is in effect. If the voters in the school district do not authorize the budget increase amount, the existing budget increase remains in effect for the time period for which it was authorized. The maximum additional increase authorized as provided in subsection I or J of this section and the additional increase that is included in the aggregate budget limit is based on a percentage of a school district's revenue control limit in future years, if the budget increase is authorized for more than one year. If the additional increase:

1. Is for two years, the proposed increase in the second year is equal to the initial proposed percentage increase.

2. Is for five years or more, the proposed increase is equal to the initial proposed percentage increase in the following years of the proposed increase, except that in the next to last year it is two-thirds of the initial proposed percentage increase and it is one-third of the initial proposed percentage increase in the last year of the proposed increase.

R. If the voters in a school district vote to adopt a budget in excess of district additional assistance as provided in subsection L of this section, any additional increase shall be included in the aggregate budget limit for each of the years authorized. The additional increase shall be excluded from the determination of equalization assistance.

S. If the voters in a school district vote to adopt a budget in excess of district additional assistance as provided in subsection M of this section, any additional increase shall be included in the aggregate budget limit for each of the years authorized. The additional increase shall be excluded from the determination of equalization assistance. The school district governing board may only use revenues derived from the school district's prior year's maintenance and operation fund ending cash balance and capital outlay fund ending cash balance to fund the additional increase for the period authorized but not to exceed ten years. For overrides approved by a vote of the qualified electors of the school district at an election held from and after October 31, 1998, the period of the additional increase prescribed in this subsection shall not exceed seven years for any capital override election.

T. In addition to subsections P and S of this section, from the maintenance and operation fund and capital outlay fund ending cash balances, the school district governing board shall first use any available revenues to reduce its primary tax rate to zero and shall use any remaining revenues to fund the additional increase authorized as provided in subsections F and M of this section.

E. Placement decisions of teaching intern certificate holders issued pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 1 of this section and section 15-552 shall be based on agreements between the teacher preparation provider, the provider's partner organizations and the local education agency. The practices of the department of education and the rules and policies of the state board of education may not restrict placement of teaching intern certification holders based on local education agency instructional models and may only consider the academic quality of the school, the effectiveness of the teaching intern certification holder's on-site mentor and the opportunity for a wide variety of schools and school models to access teaching intern certification holders.

A teacher shall not be transferred more than once pursuant to this subsection.

F. The governing board shall prescribe specific procedures for the teacher performance evaluation system, which shall include at least the following elements:

1. At least two actual classroom observations of the certificated teacher demonstrating teaching skills in a complete and uninterrupted lesson by the qualified evaluator.  There shall be at least sixty calendar days between the first and last observations. The last observation may follow the issuance of a preliminary notice of inadequacy of classroom performance and be used to determine whether the teacher has corrected inadequacies and has demonstrated adequate classroom performance. An observation shall not be conducted within two instructional days of any scheduled period in which school is not in session for one week or more. Within ten business days after each observation, the qualified evaluator shall provide written feedback to the teacher.

G. The governing board may waive the requirement of a second classroom observation for a continuing teacher whose teaching performance based on the first classroom observation places the teacher in one of the two highest performance classifications for the current school year, unless the teacher requests a second observation.

H. The results of an annual evaluation conducted as provided in this section shall be in writing or provided in an electronic format to the certificated teacher, and a copy shall be transmitted or provided in an electronic format to the certificated teacher within five days after completion of the evaluation. The certificated teacher may initiate a written reaction or response to the evaluation.

I. Each evaluation shall include recommendations as to areas of improvement in the performance of the certificated teacher if the performance of the teacher warrants improvement. After transmittal of an evaluation, the qualified evaluator or another board designee shall confer with the teacher to make specific recommendations as to areas of improvement in the teacher's performance. The qualified evaluator or other board designee shall provide professional development opportunities for the certificated teacher to improve performance and follow up with the teacher after a reasonable period of time for the purpose of ascertaining that the teacher is demonstrating adequate performance.

J. Copies of the evaluation report and performance classification of a certificated teacher retained by the governing board and the department of education are confidential, do not constitute a public record and shall not be released or shown to any person except:

1. To the certificated teacher who may make any use of it.

2. To authorized district officers and employees for all personnel matters regarding employment and contracts and for any hearing that relates to personnel matters.

3. To school districts and charter schools that inquire about the performance of the teacher for prospective employment purposes.  A school district or charter school that receives information about a certificated teacher from the evaluation report and performance classification shall use this information solely for employment purposes and shall not release this information to or allow access to this information by any other person, entity, school district or charter school.

### Article 3.1 - English Language Education for Children in Public Schools

#### Section 15-751. Definitions

 

(Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 Applies)

 

In this article,

1. "Bilingual education/native language instruction" means a language acquisition process for students in which much or all instruction, textbooks, or teaching materials are in the child's native language other than English.

2. "English language classroom" means a classroom in which English is the language of instruction used by the teaching personnel, and in which such teaching personnel possess a good knowledge of the English language.  English language classrooms encompass both English language mainstream classrooms and sheltered English immersion classrooms

3. "English language mainstream classroom" means a classroom in which the students either are native English language speakers or already have acquired reasonable fluency in English.

4. "English learner" or "limited English proficient student" means a child who does not speak English or whose native language is not English, and who is not currently able to perform ordinary classroom work in English.

5. "Sheltered English immersion" or "structured English immersion" means an English language acquisition process for young children in which nearly all classroom instruction is in English but with the curriculum and presentation designed for children who are learning the language.  Books and instructional materials are in English and all reading, writing, and subject matter are taught in English.  Although teachers may use a minimal amount of the child's native language when necessary, no subject matter shall be taught in any language other than English, and children in this program learn to read and write solely in English.  This educational methodology represents the standard definition of "sheltered English" or "structured English" found in educational literature.

#### Section 15-752. English language education

 

(Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 Applies)

 

Subject to the exceptions provided in section 15-753, all children in Arizona public schools shall be taught English by being taught in English and all children shall be placed in English language classrooms. Children who are English learners shall be educated through sheltered English immersion during a temporary transition period not normally intended to exceed one year.  Local schools shall be permitted but not required to place in the same classroom English learners of different ages but whose degree of English proficiency is similar.  Local schools shall be encouraged to mix together in the same classroom English learners from different native-language groups but with the same degree of English fluency.  Once English learners have acquired a good working knowledge of English and are able to do regular school work in English, they shall no longer be classified as English learners and shall be transferred to English language mainstream classrooms.  As much as possible, current per capita supplemental funding for English learners shall be maintained.  Foreign language classes for children who already know English shall be completely unaffected, as shall special educational programs for physically- or mentally-impaired students.

#### Section 15-753. Parental waivers

 

(Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 Applies)

 

A. The requirements of section 15-752 may be waived with the prior written informed consent, to be provided annually, of the child's parents or legal guardian under the circumstances specified in this section.  Such informed consent shall require that said parents or legal guardian personally visit the school to apply for the waiver and that they there be provided a full description of the educational materials to be used in the different educational program choices and all the educational opportunities available to the child.  If a parental waiver has been granted, the affected child shall be transferred to classes teaching English and other subjects through bilingual education techniques or other generally recognized educational methodologies permitted by law.  Individual schools in which 20 students or more of a given grade level receive a waiver shall be required to offer such a class; in all other cases, such students must be permitted to transfer to a public school in which such a class is offered.

B. The circumstances in which a parental exception waiver may be applied for under this section are as follows:

1. Children who already know English: the child already possesses good English language skills, as measured by oral evaluation or standardized tests of English vocabulary comprehension, reading, and writing, in which the child scores approximately at or above the state average for his grade level or at or above the 5th grade average, whichever is lower; or

2. Older children: the child is age 10 years or older, and it is the informed belief of the school principal and educational staff that an alternate course of educational study would be better suited to the child's overall educational progress and rapid acquisition of basic English language skills; or

3. Children with special individual needs: the child already has been placed for a period of not less than thirty calendar days during that school year in an English language classroom and it is subsequently the informed belief of the school principal and educational staff that the child has such special and individual physical or psychological needs, above and beyond the child's lack of English proficiency, that an alternate course of educational study would be better suited to the child's overall educational development and rapid acquisition of English.  A written description of no less than 250 words documenting these special individual needs for the specific child must be provided and permanently added to the child's official school records, and the waiver application must contain the original authorizing signatures of both the school principal and the local superintendent of schools.  Any such decision to issue such an individual waiver is to be made subject to the examination and approval of the local school superintendent, under guidelines established by and subject to the review of the local governing board and ultimately the state board of education. Teachers and local school districts may reject waiver requests without explanation or legal consequence, the existence of such special individual needs shall not compel issuance of a waiver, and the parents shall be fully informed of their right to refuse to agree to a waiver.

#### Section 15-754. Legal standing and parental enforcement

 

(Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 Applies)

 

As detailed in sections 15-752 and 15-753, all Arizona school children have the right to be provided at their local school with an English language public education. The parent or legal guardian of any Arizona school child shall have legal standing to sue for enforcement of the provisions of this statute, and if successful shall be awarded normal and customary attorney's fees and actual and compensatory damages, but not punitive or consequential damages.  Any school board member or other elected official or administrator who willfully and repeatedly refuses to implement the terms of this statute may be held personally liable for fees and actual and compensatory damages by the child's parents or legal guardian, and cannot be subsequently indemnified for such assessed damages by any public or private third party. Any individual found so liable shall be immediately removed from office, and shall be barred from holding any position of authority anywhere within the Arizona public school system for an additional period of five years.

#### Section 15-755. Standardized testing for monitoring education progress

 

(Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 applies)

 

In order to ensure that the educational progress of all Arizona students in academic subjects and in learning English is properly monitored, a standardized, nationally-normed written test of academic subject matter given in English shall be administered at least once each year to all Arizona public schoolchildren in grades two through twelve.  All students with disabilities shall be included in all general state and district assessments, with appropriate accommodations and alternate assessments where necessary and as indicated in their respective individual education program, in accordance with 20 United States Code   The particular test to be used shall be selected by the office of the state superintendent of public instruction, and it is intended that the test shall generally remain the same from year to year.  The national percentile scores of students shall be confidentially provided to individual parents, and the aggregated percentile scores and distributional data for individual schools and school districts shall be made publicly available on an internet web site, and the scores for students classified as "limited-English" shall be separately subaggregated and made publicly available there as well.  Although administration of this test is required solely for monitoring educational progress, Arizona public officials and administrators may utilize these test scores for other purposes as well if they so choose.

 

#### Section 15-756. Identification of English language learners

A. The primary or home language for all new pupils who enroll in a school district or charter school shall be identified in a manner prescribed by the superintendent of public instruction.

B. The English language proficiency of all pupils with a primary or home language other than English shall be assessed through the administration of English language proficiency assessments in a manner prescribed by the superintendent of public instruction.  The test scores adopted by the superintendent as indicating English language proficiency shall be based on the test publishers' designated scores. The department shall annually request an appropriation to pay for the purchase of all language proficiency assessments, scoring and ancillary materials as prescribed by the department for school districts and charter schools.

C. If it is determined that a pupil is not English language proficient, the pupil shall be classified as an English language learner and shall be enrolled in an English language education program pursuant to section 15-752 or 15-753.

If the individualized education program team determines that a residential special education placement is the least restrictive environment in which an appropriate educational program can be provided, the home school district shall submit the following documentation to the department of education:

1. A residential special education voucher application signed by designated representatives of the state placing agency, as defined in section 15-1181, and the home school district, respectively.

2. The educational reasons for recommending the residential special education placement, including an evaluation or addendum to the evaluation that describes the instructional and behavioral interventions that were previously attempted and the educational reasons for recommending the residential special education placement, including documentation that the nature or severity of the disability is such that education in a less restrictive environment is not appropriate.

3. Exit criteria as required in subsection K of this section.

4. That prior written notice for a change in the child's placement was provided.

H. If a residential special education placement is required by the child's individualized education program, the educational component of the residential facility shall be one that is approved by the department of education for the specific special education services required.

I. The residential component of the facility in which the residential special education placement is made shall be licensed by the department of economic security, the department of child safety or the department of health services, whichever is appropriate.

J. Following and in accordance with the consensus decision of the individualized education program team as prescribed in section 15-766, a residential special education placement shall be made by the school district and the appropriate state agency. The individualized education program team shall determine whether a residential special education placement is necessary. The state placing agency shall consider the recommendations of the individualized education program team in selecting the specific residential facility. The department of education shall enter into interagency services agreements with the department of economic security, the department of child safety or the Arizona health care cost containment system to establish a mechanism for resolving disputes if the school district and the department of economic security, the department of child safety or the Arizona health care cost containment system cannot mutually agree on the specific residential placement to be made. Dispute resolution procedures may not be used to deny or delay residential special education placement.

K. The individualized education program for any child who requires residential special education placement must include exit criteria that indicate when the educational placement of the child shall be reviewed to determine whether the child can be moved to a less restrictive placement.

L. All noneducational and nonmedical costs incurred by the placement of a child with a disability in a private or public school program and concurrent out-of-home care program shall be paid by the department of economic security for those children eligible to receive services through the division of developmental disabilities, by the department of child safety for the children for which it has legal responsibility and by the Arizona health care cost containment system for those children eligible to receive behavioral health or children's rehabilitation services through the Arizona health care cost containment system administration. This section does not prevent or limit the Arizona health care cost containment system, the department of child safety and the department of economic security from joint case management of any child who qualifies for services from two or more of these agencies or from sharing the noneducational costs of providing those services. The educational costs incurred by the placement of a child with a disability in an out-of-home care facility shall be paid as follows:

1. Through a residential special education placement voucher as provided in section 15-1184 if the child is determined to require a residential special education placement as defined in section 15-761.

2. Through an initial or continuing residential education voucher if a child is placed in a private residential facility by a state placing agency, as defined in section 15-1181, for care, treatment and safety reasons and the child needs educational services while in that placement.

3. Through a certificate of educational convenience if the child is attending a public school not within the child's school district of residence as provided in section 15-825.

4. By the home school district, pursuant to a contract with a public or private school as provided in subsection D of this section, if the home school district is unable to provide satisfactory education and services through its own facilities and personnel.

M. The department of economic security, the department of child safety or the Arizona health care cost containment system, whichever is appropriate, shall determine if the child placed for purposes of special education in a private or public school and concurrent out-of-home care is covered by an insurance policy that provides for inpatient or outpatient child or adolescent psychiatric treatment. The appropriate state agency may only pay charges for treatment costs that are not covered by an insurance policy. Notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate state agency may pay for placement costs of the child before the verification of applicable insurance coverage. On the depletion of insurance benefits, the appropriate state agency shall resume payment for all noneducational and nonmedical costs incurred in the treatment of the child. The appropriate state agency may request the child's family to contribute a voluntary amount toward the noneducational and nonmedical costs incurred as a result of residential placement of the child. The amount that the appropriate state agency requests the child's family to contribute shall be based on guidelines in the rules of the appropriate state agency governing the determination of contributions by parents and estates. This subsection does not require parents to incur any costs for required special education and related services or shall be construed to result in a reduction in lifetime insurance benefits available for a child with a disability.

N. If appropriate services are offered by the school district and the parent or the child chooses for the child to attend a private facility, either for day care or for twenty-four-hour care, neither the school district nor the respective agency is obligated to assume the cost of the private facility. If residential twenty-four-hour care is necessitated by factors such as the child's home condition and is not related to the special educational needs of the child, the agency responsible for the care of the child is not required to pay any additional costs of room and board and nonmedical expenses pursuant to this section.

 

#### Section 15-766. Evaluation of child for placement in special education program; due process hearing procedures

D. The department of education shall evaluate claim requests on a quarterly basis.  If there are insufficient monies in the fund to fund all eligible claims within a given quarter, the department shall prioritize funding based on the difference in the claim amount submitted by the school district or charter school and the total funding the school district or charter school has received for that student. If a school district or charter school submits a claim with insufficient information, the department may notify the school district or charter school to revise its claim within two weeks.

E. If a school district or charter school incurs an additional expense for a student who received funding for a claim from the fund in the same fiscal year, the school district or charter school may revise the claim and may receive funding at the end of the quarter in which the claim is submitted, subject to available monies in the fund.

A. Pupils shall comply with the rules, pursue the required course of study and submit to the authority of the teachers, the administrators and the governing board. A teacher may send a pupil to the principal's office in order to maintain effective discipline in the classroom.  If a pupil is sent to the principal's office pursuant to this subsection, the principal shall employ appropriate discipline management techniques that are consistent with rules adopted by the school district governing board.  A teacher may remove a pupil from the classroom if either of the following conditions exists:

1. The teacher has documented that the pupil has repeatedly interfered with the teacher's ability to communicate effectively with the other pupils in the classroom or with the ability of the other pupils to learn.

2. The teacher has determined that the pupil's behavior is so unruly, disruptive or abusive that it seriously interferes with the teacher's ability to communicate effectively with the other pupils in the classroom or with the ability of the other pupils to learn.

B. A pupil may be expelled for continued open defiance of authority, continued disruptive or disorderly behavior, violent behavior that includes use or display of a dangerous instrument or a deadly weapon as defined in section 13-105, use or possession of a gun, or excessive absenteeism.  A pupil may be expelled for excessive absenteeism only if the pupil has reached the age or completed the grade after which school attendance is not required as prescribed in section 15-802.  A school district may expel pupils for actions other than those listed in this subsection as the school district deems appropriate. Any expulsions of pupils in a kindergarten program and grades one through four must comply with section 15-843, subsection K.

F. A school district may reassign a pupil to an alternative education program if the pupil refuses to comply with rules, refuses to pursue the required course of study or refuses to submit to the authority of teachers, administrators or the governing board.

G. A school district or charter school shall expel from school for a period of not less than one year a pupil who is determined to have brought a firearm to a school within the jurisdiction of the school district or the charter school, except that the school district or charter school may modify this expulsion requirement for a pupil on a case-by-case basis. This subsection shall be construed consistently with the requirements of the individuals with disabilities education act (20 United States Code sections 1400 through 1420). For the purposes of this subsection:

1. "Expel" may include removing a pupil from a regular school setting and providing educational services in an alternative setting.

2. "Firearm" means a firearm as defined in 18 United States Code

H. A school district or charter school shall expel from school for at least one year a pupil who is determined to have threatened an educational institution, except that the school district or charter school may modify this expulsion requirement for a pupil on a case-by-case basis if the pupil participates in mediation, community service, restitution or other programs in which the pupil takes responsibility for the results of the threat. This subsection shall be construed consistently with the requirements of the individuals with disabilities education act (20 United States Code sections 1400 through 1420).  A school district may reassign a pupil who is subject to expulsion pursuant to this subsection to an alternative education program pursuant to subsection E of this section if the pupil participates in mediation, community service, restitution or other programs in which the pupil takes responsibility for the threat.  A school district or charter school may require the pupil's parent or guardian to participate in mediation, community service, restitution or other programs in which the parent or guardian takes responsibility with the pupil for the threat. For the purposes of this subsection, "threatened an educational institution" means to interfere with or disrupt an educational institution as defined in section 13-2911 by doing any of the following:

4. Refusing to obey a lawful order to leave the property of an educational institution.

I. Each school district shall establish an alternative to suspension program in consultation with local law enforcement officials or school resource officers. The school district governing board shall adopt policies to determine the requirements for participation in the alternative to suspension program.  Pupils who would otherwise be subject to suspension pursuant to this article and who meet the school district's requirements for participation in the alternative to suspension program shall be transferred to a location on school premises that is isolated from other pupils or transferred to a location that is not on school premises. The alternative to suspension program shall be discipline intensive and require academic work, and may require community service, groundskeeping and litter control, parent supervision, and evaluation or other appropriate activities. The community service, groundskeeping and litter control, and other appropriate activities may be performed on school grounds or at any other designated area.

J. Each school shall establish a placement review committee to determine the placement of a pupil if a teacher refuses to readmit the pupil to the teacher's class and to make recommendations to the governing board regarding the readmission of expelled pupils. The process for determining the placement of a pupil in a new class or replacement in the existing class shall not exceed three business days after the date the pupil was first removed from the existing class.  The principal shall not return a pupil to the classroom from which the pupil was removed without the teacher's consent unless the committee determines that the return of the pupil to that classroom is the best or only practicable alternative.  The committee shall be composed of two teachers who are employed at the school and who are selected by the faculty members of the school and one administrator who is employed by the school and who is selected by the principal.  The faculty members of the school shall select a third teacher to serve as an alternate member of the committee. If the teacher who refuses to readmit the pupil is a member of the committee, that teacher shall be excused from participating in the determination of the pupil's readmission and the alternate teacher member shall replace that teacher on the committee until the conclusion of all matters relating to that pupil's readmission.

#### Section 15-901.06. Dropout recovery programs; written learning plan; requirements; annual report; definitions

A. Each school district and charter school that provides instruction to high school pupils may offer a dropout recovery program for eligible pupils.

B. The state board of education shall prescribe standards and achievement testing requirements for dropout recovery programs that attempt to ensure that the programs are compatible with public school education goals and requirements. The standards shall require dropout recovery programs to do all of the following:

1. Provide curricula aligned to the academic standards adopted by the state board of education. The curricula may be delivered online. A provider of Arizona online instruction pursuant to section 15-808 may not also operate a dropout recovery program pursuant to this section.

2. Provide standardized tests required by federal and state law.

3. Make available appropriate and sufficient supports for pupils, including tutoring, career counseling and college counseling.

4. Comply with federal and state laws governing pupils with disabilities.

5. Meet state requirements for high school graduation.

C. Each eligible pupil who is enrolled in a dropout recovery program shall have a written learning plan developed by the pupil's assigned mentor. The written learning plan shall include the following elements:

1. The start date and anticipated end date of the plan.

2. Courses to be completed by the pupil during the academic year.

3. Whether courses will be taken sequentially or concurrently.

4. State competency exams to be taken, as necessary.

5. Expectations for satisfactory monthly progress.

6. Expectations for contact with the pupil's assigned mentor.

D. The monthly participation in a dropout recovery program shall be recorded on or before the tenth school day of each month and shall be reported to the department of education at the same time as other data required pursuant to section 15-1042. Monthly participation calculations shall include:

1. Newly enrolled pupils who have a written learning plan on file on or before the first school day of the previous month.

2. Pupils who met the expectations for satisfactory monthly progress in the previous month.

3. Pupils who did not meet the expectations for satisfactory monthly progress in the previous month but did meet the expectations in the month before the previous month.

4. Pupils who met expectations for program reentry in the revised written learning plan in the previous month.

E. Because dropout recovery pupils are not expected to regularly attend classes at the district facilities, standard procedures for recording pupil attendance cannot be effectively applied to those students.  For pupils participating in a dropout recovery program, an eligible pupil shall be counted as being in attendance in the school's average daily attendance calculations pursuant to subsection F of this section if the pupil meets one of the following conditions:

1. Is in the first month of enrollment in the program and completes the program orientation during that month.

2. Is enrolled in teacher-facilitated courses and meets the expectations for satisfactory monthly progress for the current or previous month.  A pupil who does not meet expectations for monthly progress for two or more consecutive months shall not be reported as being in attendance until the pupil meets the expectations for program reentry.

3. Meets the expectations for program reentry in the revised written learning plan.

F. If a pupil is enrolled in a school district or charter school other than the school district or charter school that participates in the dropout recovery program and also participates in a dropout recovery program in the same fiscal year, the average daily membership as prescribed in section 15-901, subsection A, paragraph 1, subdivisions (a) and (b) for that pupil in the school district or charter school and in a dropout recovery program shall not exceed 1.0, except that if the pupil is enrolled in a dropout recovery program and a career technical education district, the average daily membership provisions of section 15-393 apply.  If the pupil is enrolled in both a school district or charter school and a dropout recovery program in the same fiscal year and the sum of the average daily membership and average daily attendance for that pupil is greater than 1.0 or the amount prescribed in section 15-393 if the pupil is enrolled in a career technical education district, the sum shall be reduced to 1.0 or to the amount specified in section 15-393 if the pupil is enrolled in a career technical education district and shall be apportioned between the school district or charter school and the career technical education district, if applicable, and the dropout recovery program based on the proportionate shares of average daily membership in the school district or charter school and the average daily attendance in the dropout recovery program. The uniform system of financial records shall include guidelines for the apportionment of pupil enrollment and attendance as provided in this subsection.  Pupils in a dropout recovery program do not incur absences for purposes of this subsection and may generate average daily attendance for attendance during any hour of the day, during any day of the week and at any time between July 1 and June 30 of each fiscal year. The average daily attendance of a pupil who participates in a dropout recovery program shall not exceed 1.0 or the amount prescribed in section 15-393 if the pupil is enrolled in a career technical education district, and shall be calculated by fulfilling the requirements of subsection E of this section. Average daily membership shall not be calculated on the one hundredth day of instruction for the purposes of this section.

G. Notwithstanding section 15-901, subsection A, paragraph 1, the average daily membership for pupils enrolled in a dropout recovery program shall equal the average daily attendance of the pupils.

H. School districts and charter schools shall be responsible for tuition charges and fees related to pupil participation in a dropout recovery program, including course materials and access to technology for use with online courses.

I. School districts and charter schools may contract with an educational management organization to provide a dropout recovery program.  If contracting with an educational management organization, the school district or charter school shall ensure that all of the following requirements are met:

1. The educational management organization is accredited by a regional accrediting body.

2. Teachers provided by the educational management organization hold a current teaching license from any state and a valid Arizona fingerprint clearance card pursuant to section 15-534, and teachers of core subjects are highly qualified in the subjects to which they are assigned.

J. Dropout recovery programs shall be classified as alternative schools and shall be subject to the accountability provisions of section 15-241.

K. Entities that are contracted to provide dropout recovery programs may conduct outreach to encourage pupils who are not currently enrolled in a school district or charter school in this state to return to school.  Entities that are contracted to provide dropout recovery programs shall not conduct advertising or marketing campaigns directed at pupils who are currently enrolled in a school district or charter school, or undertake any other activity that encourages pupils who are currently enrolled in a school district or charter school to stop attending school in order to qualify for a dropout recovery program.

L. The department of education shall submit an annual report to the governor, the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives that details the outcomes of dropout recovery programs, including the number of pupils who participate in the programs and the number of pupils who participate in the programs and who graduate from high school. The department shall provide a copy of the annual report to the secretary of state.

M. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Eligible pupil" means a pupil who, if enrolled, would be eligible for placement in an alternative school but who is not currently enrolled in a school district or charter school and who has been withdrawn from a school district or charter school for at least thirty days, unless the district determines that the student is unable to participate in other district programs.

2. "Satisfactory monthly progress" means an amount of progress that is measurable on a monthly basis and that, if continued for twelve months, would result in the same amount of academic credit being awarded to the pupil as would be awarded to a pupil in a traditional education program who completes a full school year.  Satisfactory monthly progress may include a lesser required amount of progress for the first two months that a pupil participates in the program.

 

#### Section 15-901.07. Concurrent coursework; calculation of average daily membership; definition

A. A school district or a charter school may include students enrolled in concurrent coursework for the purposes of calculating average daily membership if the school district has received approval from the state board of education or the charter school has received approval from its sponsor to offer concurrent coursework and all of the following apply:

6. The school district or charter school pays the community college or university for the tuition cost of the concurrent coursework or reimburses the student for the tuition cost of the concurrent coursework.

B. A course at a community college or university of three semester hours of credit or more is considered a subject for the purposes of meeting the definition of full-time student prescribed in section 15-901. A course at a community college or university of three semester hours of credit or more is not required to meet one hundred twenty-three hours a year, or the equivalent, to be considered a subject.

C. Instructional hours provided by a community college or university to a student in concurrent coursework shall be included in the calculation of the average daily membership for that student pursuant to section 15-901.

D. Average daily membership for classes at a community college or university shall be based on the community college or university credits earned by the student.  For each community college or university course for which three credits are earned, one-eighth of an average daily membership shall be generated. Except as otherwise provided by law, for a full-time high school student who attends concurrent enrollment courses pursuant to this section, the average daily membership may not exceed 1.0.

E. For the purposes of this section, "concurrent coursework" means courses at a community college under the jurisdiction of a community college district in this state or at a university under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents in the required or elective subjects that satisfy high school graduation requirements pursuant to section 15-701.01.

G. The governing board may authorize the expenditure of monies budgeted within the maintenance and operation section of the budget for any subsection within the section in excess of amounts specified in the adopted budget only by action taken at a public meeting of the governing board and if the expenditures for all subsections of the section do not exceed the amount budgeted as provided in this section.

School districts that underestimated tuition revenues may adjust their budgets before May 15 based on tuition revenues for attendance of nonresident pupils during the current fiscal year. School districts that overestimated revenues as provided in section 15-947, subsection C, paragraph 2, subdivision (a), items (iii), (iv) and (v) and subdivision (c) shall adjust the general budget limit and expenditures based on actual revenues during the current fiscal year. School districts that underestimated such revenues may adjust their budgets before May 15 based on actual revenues during the current fiscal year. Procedures for completing adjustments shall be as prescribed in the uniform system of financial records. Not later than May 18, the budget as adjusted shall be submitted electronically to the superintendent of public instruction.

J. A common school district not within a high school district whose estimated tuition charge for high school pupils exceeds the actual tuition charge for high school pupils shall adjust the general budget limit and expenditures based on the actual tuition charge.  Not later than May 18, the budget as adjusted shall be submitted electronically to the superintendent of public instruction. A common school district not within a high school district whose estimated tuition charge for high school pupils is less than the actual tuition charge for high school pupils may adjust its budget before May 15 based on the actual tuition charge.  Procedures for completing adjustments shall be as prescribed in the uniform system of financial records. If the adjusted general budget limit requires an adjustment of state aid and if the adjustment to state aid is not made in the current year, the superintendent of public instruction shall adjust by August 15 of the succeeding fiscal year the apportionment of state aid to the school district to correct any overpayment or underpayment of state aid received during the current year.

K. The governing board may include title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance allocated for children with disabilities, children with specific learning disabilities, children residing on Indian lands and children residing within the boundaries of an accommodation school that is located on a military reservation and that is classified as a heavily impacted local educational agency pursuant to 20 United States Code section 7703, which is in addition to basic assistance when determining the general budget limit as prescribed in section 15-947, subsection C. The increase in the general budget limit for children residing within the boundaries of an accommodation school that is located on a military reservation and that is classified as a heavily impacted local education agency shall equal the dollar amount calculated pursuant to 20 United States Code section 7703(b)(2). The governing board may adjust before May 15 the budget for the current year based on any adjustments that result in increases over the amount estimated by the superintendent of public instruction for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance for such pupils for the fiscal year preceding the current year. The governing board shall adjust before May 15 the budget for the current year based on any adjustments that result in decreases in the amount estimated by the superintendent of public instruction for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance for such pupils for the fiscal year preceding the current year.

If the expenditures of any school district exceed these limits or sections of the budget without authorization as provided in section 15-907, and if the state board of education determines that the equalization assistance for education received by the school district as provided in section 15-971 does not conform with statutory requirements, the state board of education shall reduce the state aid for equalization assistance for education for the school district computed as provided in section 15-971 during the fiscal year subsequent to the fiscal year in which the excess equalization assistance for education was received by an amount equal to the excess equalization assistance for education, except that in case of hardship to the school district, the superintendent of public instruction may approve reductions partly in the first subsequent year and partly in the second subsequent year. If the state board of education determines that the equalization assistance for education received by the school district conforms with statutory requirements, the state board of education shall not reduce the district's equalization assistance for education pursuant to this subsection but the district shall reduce the budget limits as required in subsection M of this section. A school district that disagrees with the department of education's determination regarding an excess expenditure under this subsection may request a hearing before the state board of education.

M. The governing board of a school district shall reduce the general budget limit or the unrestricted capital budget limit for the year subsequent to the year in which the expenditures were in excess of the applicable limit or section of the budget by the amount determined in subsection L of this section, except that in case of hardship to the school district, the superintendent of public instruction may approve reductions partly in the first subsequent year and partly in the second subsequent year. The reduction in the limit is applicable to each school district that has exceeded the general budget limit, the unrestricted capital budget limit or a section of the budget even if the reduction exceeds the state aid for equalization assistance for education for the school district.

N. Except as provided in section 15-916, no expenditure shall be made by any school district for a purpose not included in the budget or in excess of the aggregate budget limit prescribed in this section, except that if no budget has been adopted, from July 1 to July 15 the governing board may make expenditures if the total of the expenditures does not exceed ten percent of the prior year's aggregate budget limit. Any expenditures made from July 1 to July 15 and before the adoption of the budget shall be included in the total expenditures for the current year. No expenditure shall be made and no debt, obligation or liability shall be incurred or created in any year for any purpose itemized in the budget in excess of the amount specified for the item irrespective of whether the school district at any time has received or has on hand funds in excess of those required to meet the expenditures, debts, obligations and liabilities provided for under the budget except expenditures from cash controlled funds as defined by the uniform system of financial records and except as provided in section 15-907 and subsection G of this section. This subsection does not prohibit any school district from prepaying insurance premiums, magazine subscriptions or officiating services, or from prepaying any item that is normally prepaid in order to procure the service or to receive a discounted price for the service, as prescribed by the uniform system of financial records.

O. The governing board of a school district that is classified as a heavily impacted school district having twenty percent or more pupils pursuant to 20 United States Code section 238(d)1(A) may determine its eligibility to increase the amount that may be included in determining the general budget limit as provided in subsection K of this section and may increase the amount as follows:

1. For fiscal year 1988-1989:

(a) Multiply $1,094 by the number of children with disabilities or children with specific learning disabilities, excluding children who also reside on Indian lands, reported to the division of impact aid, United States department of education in the district's application for fiscal year 1987-1988.

(b) Multiply $547 by the number of children residing on Indian lands, excluding children who have disabilities or also have specific learning disabilities, reported to the division of impact aid, United States department of education in the district's application for fiscal year 1987-1988.

(c) Multiply $1,914 by the number of children residing on Indian lands who have disabilities or also have specific learning disabilities reported to the division of impact aid, United States department of education in the district's application for fiscal year 1987-1988.

(d) Add the amounts determined in subdivisions (a) through (c) of this paragraph.

(e) If the amount of title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance as provided in subsection K of this section is less than the sum determined in subdivision (d) of this paragraph, the district is eligible to use this subsection.

2. For budget years after 1988-1989, use paragraph 1 of this subsection, but increase each dollar amount by the growth rate for that year as prescribed by law, subject to appropriation and use the number of children reported in the appropriate category for the current fiscal year.

3. If the district is eligible to use this subsection, subtract the amount of title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance determined in subsection K of this section from the sum determined in paragraph 1, subdivision (d) of this subsection. The difference is the increase in the amount that may be included in determining the general budget limit as provided in subsection K of this section, if including this amount does not increase the district's primary tax rate for the budget year. If the amount of title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance determined in subsection K of this section is adjusted for the current year, the increase determined in this paragraph shall be recomputed using the adjusted amount and the recomputed increase shall be reported to the department of education by May 15 on a form prescribed by the department of education.

4. If a district uses this subsection, the district is not required to adjust its budget for the current year based on adjustments in the estimated amount of title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance as provided in subsection K of this section.

P. A school district, except for an accommodation school, that applies for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance during the current year may budget an amount for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 administrative costs for the budget year. The amount budgeted for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 administrative costs is exempt from the revenue control limit and may not exceed an amount determined for the budgeted year as follows:

1. Determine the minimum cost. The minimum cost for fiscal year 1990-1991 is $2,343. For fiscal year 1991-1992 and thereafter, the minimum cost is the minimum cost for the prior year increased by the growth rate as prescribed by law, subject to appropriation.

2. Determine the hourly rate. The hourly rate for fiscal year 1990-1991 is $9.38. For fiscal year 1991-1992 and thereafter, the hourly rate is the hourly rate for the prior year increased by the growth rate as prescribed by law, subject to appropriation.

3. Determine the title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 revenues available by subtracting the amount of title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance used to increase the general budget limit as provided in subsections K and O of this section for the current fiscal year from the total amount of title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 revenues received in the current fiscal year.

4. Determine the total number of administrative hours as follows:

(a) Determine the sum of the following:

(i) 1.00 hours for each high impact pupil who is not a person with a disability or does not have specific learning disabilities.

(ii) 1.25 hours for each high impact pupil who is a person with a disability or has specific learning disabilities.

(iii) 0.25 hours for each low impact pupil who is not a person with a disability or does not have specific learning disabilities.

(iv) 0.31 hours for each low impact pupil who is a person with a disability or has specific learning disabilities.

(b) For the purposes of this paragraph:

(i) "High impact pupil" means a pupil who resides on Indian lands or a pupil who resides on federal property or in low rent housing and whose parent is employed on federal property or low rent housing property or is on active duty in uniformed service, as provided in title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965, section 8003(a) (20 United States Code section 7703) and as reported in the application for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance in the current year.

(ii) "Low impact pupil" means a pupil who resides on nonfederal property and has a parent who is employed on federal property or low rent housing property or is on active duty in a uniformed service or a pupil who resides on federal property or in low rent housing and who does not have a parent who is employed on federal property or low rent housing property or is on active duty in uniformed service, as provided in title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965, section 8003(a) (20 United States Code section 7703) and as reported in the application for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance in the current year.

5. Multiply the total number of administrative hours determined in paragraph 4 of this subsection by the hourly rate determined in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

6. Determine the greater of the minimum cost determined in paragraph 1 of this subsection or the product determined in paragraph 5 of this subsection.

7. Add to the amount determined in paragraph 6 of this subsection the amount, if any, to be expended by the school district in the budget year through an intergovernmental agreement with other school districts or the department of education to provide title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 technical assistance to participating districts.

8. Determine the lesser of the amount determined in paragraph 7 of this subsection or the revenues available as determined in paragraph 3 of this subsection.

9. The amount determined in paragraph 8 of this subsection is the maximum amount that may be budgeted for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 administrative costs for the budget year as provided in this subsection.

10. If the governing board underestimated the amount that may be budgeted for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965, section 8007 administrative costs for the current year, the board may adjust the general budget limit and the budget before May 15. If the governing board overestimated the amount that may be budgeted for title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 administrative costs for the current year, the board shall adjust the general budget limit and the budget before May 15.

Q. If a school district governing board has adopted a budget for a fiscal year based on forms and instructions provided by the auditor general and the department of education for that fiscal year and if, as a result of the enactment or nonenactment of proposed legislation after May 1 of the previous fiscal year, the budget is based on incorrect limits, does not include items authorized by law or does not otherwise conform with law, the governing board may revise its budget at a public hearing on or before September 15 to conform with the law. Not later than September 18, the budget as adjusted shall be submitted electronically to the superintendent of public instruction.  If the governing board does not revise the budget on or before September 15 and if the budget includes any items not authorized by law or if the budget exceeds any limits, the governing board shall adjust or revise the budget as provided in subsection E of this section.

R. Notwithstanding any other law, if a school district receives assistance pursuant to title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965, the school district shall establish a local level fund designated as the impact aid fund and deposit the impact aid monies received in the fund.  The school district shall separately account for monies in the fund and shall not combine monies in the fund with any other source of local, state or federal assistance.  Monies in the fund shall be expended pursuant to federal law only for the purposes allowed by this title. The school district shall account for monies in the fund according to the uniform system of financial records as prescribed by the auditor general. The superintendent of public instruction shall separately account for monies in each school district's impact aid fund, if an impact aid fund is established, in the annual report required by section 15-255. Monies in the fund are considered federal monies and are not subject to legislative appropriation.

S. For the purposes of this section, "title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance" means, for the current year, an amount equal to the final determination of title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance for the fiscal year preceding the current year as confirmed by the division of impact aid, United States department of education or, if a final determination has not been made, the amount estimated by the superintendent of public instruction as confirmed by the division of impact aid, United States department of education and, for the budget year, an amount equal to the determination of title VIII of the elementary and secondary education act of 1965 assistance for the fiscal year preceding the budget year as estimated by the superintendent of public instruction.

#### Section 15-905.01. Truth in taxation; calculation; notice and hearing; vote on tax increase

If the amount exceeding the previous truth in taxation base limit is approved by the school district governing board following the hearing prescribed in subsection B of this section, the excess amount plus the previous truth in taxation base limit becomes the school district's new truth in taxation base limit.

4. If a school district no longer qualifies for one or more of the expenditures prescribed in paragraph 1 of this subsection, the amount budgeted for the most recent fiscal year in which the school district was eligible for that expenditure shall be deducted from the school district's truth in taxation base limit.

B. For any fiscal year in which a school district governing board budgets an amount that is higher than the truth in taxation base limit calculated pursuant to subsection A of this section, any fiscal year in which a school district levies any amount for adjacent ways pursuant to section 15-995 or any fiscal year in which the school district levies any amount for liabilities in excess of the school district budget pursuant to section 15-907:

#### Section 15-910. School district budgets; excess utility costs; desegregation costs; tuition costs for bond issues; costs for registering warrants; report

 

(L22, Ch. 285, sec. 3.  Eff. 7/1/23.  Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 applies)

 

A. The governing board may budget for the district's excess utility costs that are specifically exempt from the district's revenue control limit. If approved by the qualified electors voting at a statewide general election, the exemption from the revenue control limit under this subsection expires at the end of the 2008-2009 budget year. The uniform system of financial records shall specify expenditure items allowable as excess utility costs, which are limited to direct operational costs of heating, cooling, water and electricity, telephone communications and sanitation fees. The department of education and the auditor general shall include in the maintenance and operation section of the budget format, as provided in section 15-903, a separate line for utility expenditures and a special excess utility cost category. The special excess utility cost category shall contain budgeted expenditures for excess utility costs, determined as follows:

1. Determine the lesser of the total budgeted or total actual utility expenditures for fiscal year 1984-1985.

2. Multiply the amount in paragraph 1 of this subsection by the total percentage increase or decrease in the revenue control limit and the capital outlay revenue limit for the budget year over the revenue control limit and the capital outlay revenue limit for fiscal year 1984-1985 excluding monies available from a teacher compensation program provided for in section 15-952.

3. The sum of the amounts in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection is the amount budgeted in the utility expenditure line.

4. Additional expenditures for utilities are budgeted in the excess utility cost category.

B. The governing board shall apply the same percentage increase or decrease allowed in the revenue control limit and the capital outlay revenue limit as provided in section 15-905, subsection E to the utility expenditure line of the budget.

C. The governing board may expend from the excess utility cost category only after it has expended for utility purposes the full amount budgeted in the utility expenditure line of the budget.

D. The governing board, after notice is given and a public meeting is held as provided in section 15-905, subsection D, may revise at any time before May 15 the amount budgeted in the excess utility cost category for the current year. Not later than May 18, the budget as revised shall be submitted electronically to the superintendent of public instruction.

E. If the revised excess utility cost category results in an expenditure of monies in excess of school district revenues for the current year, the county school superintendent shall include within the revenue estimate for the budget year monies necessary to meet the liabilities incurred by the school district in the current year in excess of revenues received for the current year.

F. If a school district receives a refund of utility expenditures or a rebate on energy saving devices or services, the refund or rebate shall be applied against utility expenditures for the current year as a reduction of the expenditures, except that the reduction of expenditures shall not exceed the amount of actual utility expenditures.

G. The governing board may budget for expenses of complying with or continuing to implement activities that were required or permitted by a court order of desegregation or administrative agreement with the United States department of education office for civil rights directed toward remediating alleged or proven racial discrimination that are specifically exempt in whole or in part from the revenue control limit and district additional assistance. This exemption applies only to expenses incurred for activities that are begun before the termination of the court order or administrative agreement. If a district is levying a property tax on February 23, 2006 and using those monies to administer an English language learner program to remedy alleged or proven discrimination under title VI of the civil rights act of 1964 (42 United States Code section 2000d), the district may spend those monies to remedy a violation of the equal educational opportunities act of 1974 (20 United States Code section 1703(f)). Nothing in this subsection allows a school district to levy a property tax for violations of the equal educational opportunities act of 1974 (20 United States Code section 1703(f)) in the absence of an alleged or proven discrimination under title VI of the civil rights act of 1964 (42 United States Code section 2000d).

H. If a governing board chooses to budget monies outside of the revenue control limit as provided in subsection G of this section, the governing board may do one of the following:

1. Use monies from the maintenance and operation fund equal to any excess desegregation or compliance expenses beyond the revenue control limit before June 30 of the current year.

2. Notify the county school superintendent to include the cost of the excess expenses in the county school superintendent's estimate of the additional amount needed for the school district from the secondary property tax as provided in section 15-991.

3. Employ the provisions of both paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, provided that the total amount transferred and included in the amount needed from property taxes does not exceed the total amount budgeted as prescribed in subsection J, paragraph 1 of this section.

I. If a governing board chooses to budget monies outside of district additional assistance as provided in subsection G of this section, the governing board may notify the county school superintendent to include the cost of the excess expenses in the county school superintendent's estimate of the additional amount needed for the school district from the secondary property tax as provided in section 15-991.

J. A governing board using subsections G, H and I of this section:

M. The governing board may budget for interest expenses it incurred for registering warrants drawn against a fund of the school district or net interest expense on tax anticipation notes as prescribed in section 35-465.05, subsection C for the fiscal year preceding the current year if the county treasurer pooled all school district monies for investment as provided in section 15-996 for the fiscal year preceding the current year and, in those school districts that receive state aid, the school districts applied for an apportionment of state aid before the date set for the apportionment as provided in section 15-973 for the fiscal year preceding the current year.  The governing board may budget an amount for interest expenses for registering warrants or issuing tax anticipation notes equal to or less than the amount of the warrant interest expense or net interest expense on tax anticipation notes as prescribed in section 35-465.05, subsection C for the fiscal year preceding the current year as provided in this subsection that is specifically exempt from the revenue control limit. For the purposes of this subsection, "state aid" means state aid as determined in sections 15-971 and 15-972.

#### Section 15-910. School district budgets; excess utility costs; desegregation costs; tuition costs for bond issues; costs for registering warrants; report

 

(L22, Ch. 317, sec. 6.  Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 applies)

 

A. The governing board may budget for the district's excess utility costs that are specifically exempt from the district's revenue control limit. If approved by the qualified electors voting at a statewide general election, the exemption from the revenue control limit under this subsection expires at the end of the 2008-2009 budget year. The uniform system of financial records shall specify expenditure items allowable as excess utility costs, which are limited to direct operational costs of heating, cooling, water and electricity, telephone communications and sanitation fees. The department of education and the auditor general shall include in the maintenance and operation section of the budget format, as provided in section 15-903, a separate line for utility expenditures and a special excess utility cost category. The special excess utility cost category shall contain budgeted expenditures for excess utility costs, determined as follows:

1. Determine the lesser of the total budgeted or total actual utility expenditures for fiscal year 1984-1985.

2. Multiply the amount in paragraph 1 of this subsection by the total percentage increase or decrease in the revenue control limit and the capital outlay revenue limit for the budget year over the revenue control limit and the capital outlay revenue limit for fiscal year 1984-1985.

3. The sum of the amounts in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection is the amount budgeted in the utility expenditure line.

4. Additional expenditures for utilities are budgeted in the excess utility cost category.

B. The governing board shall apply the same percentage increase or decrease allowed in the revenue control limit and the capital outlay revenue limit as provided in section 15-905, subsection E to the utility expenditure line of the budget.

C. The governing board may expend from the excess utility cost category only after it has expended for utility purposes the full amount budgeted in the utility expenditure line of the budget.

D. The governing board, after notice is given and a public meeting is held as provided in section 15-905, subsection D, may revise at any time before May 15 the amount budgeted in the excess utility cost category for the current year. Not later than May 18, the budget as revised shall be submitted electronically to the superintendent of public instruction.

E. If the revised excess utility cost category results in an expenditure of monies in excess of school district revenues for the current year, the county school superintendent shall include within the revenue estimate for the budget year monies necessary to meet the liabilities incurred by the school district in the current year in excess of revenues received for the current year.

F. If a school district receives a refund of utility expenditures or a rebate on energy saving devices or services, the refund or rebate shall be applied against utility expenditures for the current year as a reduction of the expenditures, except that the reduction of expenditures shall not exceed the amount of actual utility expenditures.

G. The governing board may budget for expenses of complying with or continuing to implement activities that were required or permitted by a court order of desegregation or administrative agreement with the United States department of education office for civil rights directed toward remediating alleged or proven racial discrimination that are specifically exempt in whole or in part from the revenue control limit and district additional assistance. This exemption applies only to expenses incurred for activities that are begun before the termination of the court order or administrative agreement. If a district is levying a property tax on February 23, 2006 and using those monies to administer an English language learner program to remedy alleged or proven discrimination under title VI of the civil rights act of 1964 (42 United States Code section 2000d), the district may spend those monies to remedy a violation of the equal educational opportunities act of 1974 (20 United States Code section 1703(f)). Nothing in this subsection allows a school district to levy a property tax for violations of the equal educational opportunities act of 1974 (20 United States Code section 1703(f)) in the absence of an alleged or proven discrimination under title VI of the civil rights act of 1964 (42 United States Code section 2000d).

H. If a governing board chooses to budget monies outside of the revenue control limit as provided in subsection G of this section, the governing board may do one of the following:

1. Use monies from the maintenance and operation fund equal to any excess desegregation or compliance expenses beyond the revenue control limit before June 30 of the current year.

2. Notify the county school superintendent to include the cost of the excess expenses in the county school superintendent's estimate of the additional amount needed for the school district from the secondary property tax as provided in section 15-991.

3. Employ the provisions of both paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, provided that the total amount transferred and included in the amount needed from property taxes does not exceed the total amount budgeted as prescribed in subsection J, paragraph 1 of this section.

I. If a governing board chooses to budget monies outside of district additional assistance as provided in subsection G of this section, the governing board may notify the county school superintendent to include the cost of the excess expenses in the county school superintendent's estimate of the additional amount needed for the school district from the secondary property tax as provided in section 15-991.

J. A governing board using subsections G, H and I of this section:

1. Shall prepare and employ a separate maintenance and operation desegregation budget and capital outlay desegregation budget on a form prescribed by the superintendent of public instruction in conjunction with the auditor general. The budget format shall be designed to allow a school district to plan and provide in detail for expenditures to be incurred solely as a result of compliance with or continuing to implement activities that were required or permitted by a court order of desegregation or administrative agreement with the United States department of education office for civil rights directed toward remediating alleged or proven racial discrimination.

2. Shall prepare as a part of the annual financial report a detailed report of expenditures incurred solely as a result of compliance with or continuing to implement activities that were required or permitted by a court order of desegregation or administrative agreement with the United States department of education office for civil rights directed toward remediating alleged or proven racial discrimination, in a format prescribed by the auditor general in conjunction with the Arizona department of education as provided by section 15-904.

(k) Verification that the desegregation funding will supplement and not supplant funding for other academic and extracurricular activities.

(l) Verification that the desegregation funding is educationally justifiable.

K. If a school district governing board budgets for expenses of complying with a court order of desegregation or an administrative agreement with the United States department of education office for civil rights directed toward remediating alleged or proven racial discrimination, the governing board shall ensure that the desegregation expenses will:

1. Be educationally justifiable.

2. Result in equal education opportunities for all pupils in the school district.

7. Each fiscal year, not exceed the amount budgeted by the school district for desegregation expenses in fiscal year 2008-2009.

L. Beginning in fiscal year 2018-2019, subsections G through K of this section apply only if the governing board uses revenues from secondary property taxes rather than primary property taxes to fund expenses of complying with or continuing to implement activities that were required or allowed by a court order of desegregation or administrative agreement with the United States department of education office for civil rights directed toward remediating alleged or proven racial discrimination that are specifically exempt in whole or in part from the revenue control limit and district additional assistance.  Secondary property taxes levied pursuant to this subsection do not require voter approval, but shall be separately delineated on a property owner's property tax statement.

A school district may deposit in the account monies generated from the energy or water savings projects or measures implemented in school facilities. A school district may use monies in the energy and water savings account for payments under a performance contract entered into pursuant to section 15-213 or 15-213.01.

B. The auditor general and the department of education shall prescribe the appropriate designation of the energy and water savings accounts in the uniform system of financial records and shall prescribe reporting requirements on the appropriate budget forms and annual financial report forms.

C. Monies deposited in an energy and water savings account shall be used as a designated pool of capital investment monies to pay for the incremental cost of energy or water savings measures in school facilities that are owned by the school district.  Any contract entered into pursuant to this section shall contain an agreement between the qualified provider and the energy or water services company that both parties have performed a reasonable investigation to determine that the measures contemplated by the contract will result in stated energy or water savings. Contract terms may extend up to the expected life, according to the manufacturer's equipment standards, of the energy cost savings measures implemented, the term of the financial agreement or twenty-five years, whichever is shortest.

D. Expenditures from an energy and water savings account shall be used only for the following:

1. Projects or measures pursuant to a contract pursuant to this section or section 15-213.01 that save energy or water in school facilities that are owned by the school district. Monies may be used pursuant to this paragraph to provide technical assistance regarding energy or water savings to school districts by a qualified provider or energy or water services company.

2. Payment of principal, interest, related financing costs and prepayment premiums.

E. School districts shall procure energy or water savings measures or services with monies distributed from the energy and water savings accounts.

F. Before the implementation of the energy or water savings measures or services, the qualified provider or energy or water services company shall compute, and the school district shall review and approve, the estimated amount of the energy or water savings and the associated impact on energy, water or other costs and revenue to be achieved by the school district on an annual and monthly basis over the term of the guaranteed energy cost savings contract and shall include these estimates in the contract. The qualified provider and the school district shall update the annual and monthly energy or water savings and associated cost impact estimates annually based on actual experience for the term of the guaranteed energy cost savings contract.

G. Before the implementation of the energy or water savings measures or services, the qualified provider or financial institution, trustee or paying agent and the school district shall jointly develop a schedule of monthly or another mutually agreed-on interval of payments for repayment of the capital investment monies. The repayment schedule shall result in lower energy, water or other costs or increased revenue, which shall include the total cost of all the installed energy or water savings measures for the school district over the expected life, according to the manufacturer's equipment standards, of the energy cost savings measures implemented, the term of the financial agreement or twenty-five years, whichever is shortest. The repayment schedule shall be included in the contract.

H. The school district shall transfer the amount of the payment prescribed pursuant to subsection G of this section to the energy and water savings account from the maintenance and operation portion of the school district's budget to repay any unpaid balance of the capital investment previously deposited in the energy and water savings account from the qualified provider or energy or water services company plus a reasonable carrying charge. For the period of time that the company's capital investment monies and reasonable carrying charge remain unpaid, the qualified provider or energy or water services company shall provide a separate billing or billing component to repay the capital investment pursuant to the repayment schedule prescribed pursuant to subsection G of this section, which shall be paid by the school district from the energy and water savings account. The school district's general budget limit shall be reduced by the amount of monies transferred to the energy and water savings account pursuant to this section.

I. After the balance of the qualified provider's or energy or water services company's capital investment monies deposited in the energy and water savings account plus a reasonable carrying charge are repaid in full by the school district, the school district may discontinue the deposit in the energy and water savings account of amounts that are prescribed in subsection G of this section.

J. Any monies associated with an energy or water savings project remaining in the energy and water savings account after the capital investment monies of the qualified provider or energy or water services company plus a reasonable carrying charge are repaid in full may be transferred to the maintenance and operation portion of the school district's budget, and the general budget limit may be increased by the amount transferred.

K. School districts may deposit energy-related rebate or grant monies in the energy and water savings account to assist in funding energy or water savings projects.  These rebate or grant monies may be used to reduce the total cost of energy or water savings projects and to reduce the amount of capital investment monies received from and repaid to utility, energy or water services companies. School districts are not required to repay the rebate or grant monies in the manner described in subsection G of this section pursuant to the agreements with the providers of rebate or grant funds.

L. School districts shall not use or deposit any excess utilities monies budgeted pursuant to section 15-910 in the energy and water savings account.

M. School districts may deposit monies from other funding sources in the energy and water savings account to fund energy or water saving projects in school facilities. These monies shall be repaid in a manner consistent with this section and pursuant to the contract between the school district and the provider of the funding.

A. The governing board of a school district may budget any budget balance in the maintenance and operation section of the budget, as provided in section 15-903, from the current fiscal year for use in the maintenance and operation section of the budget in the budget year. The amount that may be budgeted as the budget balance carryforward in any one fiscal year shall not include any budget balance attributable to any reduction in the district's general budget limit, including reductions for items that are exempt from the revenue control limit and for which expenditures are limited to a designated purpose such as monies levied pursuant to section 15-910, subsection G or for the bond issues portion of the cost of tuition. The amount budgeted as the budget balance carryforward is specifically exempt from the revenue control limit.

B. If the actual amount of the allowable budget balance carryforward is less than the amount budgeted for the budget balance carryforward, the governing board shall adjust the general budget limit and expenditures before May 15 based on the actual allowable budget balance carryforward. If the actual amount of the allowable budget balance carryforward is more than the amount budgeted for the budget balance carryforward, the governing board may adjust its budget before May 15 based on the actual amount of the allowable fund balance carryforward.  Not later than May 18, the budget as revised shall be submitted electronically to the superintendent of public instruction.

C. If the governing board is eligible to budget for a budget balance carryforward as provided in subsection A of this section, the governing board may transfer an amount from the district's ending cash balance of the maintenance and operations fund to the school opening fund. The school opening fund is a cash controlled fund as provided in section 15-905, subsection N, and may only be expended for the additional maintenance and operations expenses incurred in the first year of operation of a new school within the school district. The monies in the school opening fund are not subject to reversion, except that at the end of five years of no activity in the fund, any remaining monies shall be reverted to the maintenance and operations fund.  Any monies so reverted may be considered additional budget balance for that fiscal year.

D. If a governing board transfers monies as provided in subsection C of this section, the amount so transferred in a fiscal year shall be subtracted from the amount the district would otherwise be eligible to budget for that fiscal year as provided in subsection A of this section. The difference, if any, is the maximum amount that may be budgeted for that fiscal year as a budget balance carryforward.

E. For the purposes of this section, "budget balance" means the difference between actual and budgeted expenditures.

If the proposed budget override will be fully funded by a levy of taxes on the taxable property within the school district, the ballot shall contain the words "budget override, yes" and "budget override, no", and the voter shall signify the voter's desired choice.  The ballot shall also contain the amount of the proposed budget override compared to the amount the school district budgeted in the preceding year and the amount the school district would be allowed to budget for if the measure is not approved by the voters.  The statement shall also include the estimated amount of the override for each year the override is sought.  The ballot shall also include the following statement:

The budget override authorized by this election allows the _______________ school district to levy property taxes in excess of the property tax levy allowed by law to fund the school district's revenue control limit.  The property tax levy for the year for which adopted and for ____ subsequent years will be annually adjusted based on a formula that authorizes the _______________ school district to exceed the revenue control limit by up to thirty-five percent for kindergarten programs and grades one through eight or up to sixty-five percent for grades nine through twelve.  The levy shall not be realized from monies furnished by the state and shall not be subject to the limitation on taxes specified in article IX, section 18, Constitution of Arizona. Based on an estimate of assessed valuation used for secondary property tax purposes, the proposed override in the ________________ school district's budget over that allowed by the revenue control limit would result in an estimated increase in the school district's tax rate of _________________ dollars per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation for the secondary property tax purposes.

J. If the proposed budget override will be fully funded by revenues from other than a levy of taxes on the taxable property within the school district, the ballot shall contain the words "budget override, yes" and "budget override, no", and the voter shall signify the voter's desired choice.  The ballot shall also contain the amount of the proposed budget override compared to the amount the school district budgeted in the preceding year and the amount the school district would be allowed to budget for if the measure is not approved by the voters.  The statement shall also include the estimated amount of the override for each year the override is sought.

2. For a unified school district, for a common school district not within a high school district or for a common school district that offers instruction in high school subjects as provided in section 15-447:

(a) Determine the qualifying tax rate pursuant to section 41-1276 for the school district.

C. The clerk of the board of supervisors shall report to the department of revenue not later than the Friday following the third Monday in August of each year the amount by school district of additional state aid for education and the data used for computing the amount as provided in subsection B of this section. The department of revenue shall verify all of the amounts and report to the county board of supervisors not later than August 30 of each year the property tax rate or rates that shall be used for property tax reduction as provided in subsection E of this section.

D. The board of supervisors shall reduce the property tax rate or rates that would be levied in lieu of this section by the school district or districts on the assessed valuation used for primary property taxes of the residential property in the school district or districts by the rate or rates selected in subsection B, paragraph 1, subdivision (c) and paragraph 2, subdivision (c) of this section. The excess of the reduction in property taxes for a parcel of property resulting from the reduction in the property tax rate pursuant to this subsection over the amounts listed in this subsection shall be deducted from the amount of additional state aid for education. The reduction in property taxes on a parcel of property resulting from the reduction in the property tax rate pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed $600, except as provided in subsection I of this section.

E. Before levying taxes for school purposes, the board of supervisors shall determine whether the total primary property taxes to be levied for all taxing jurisdictions on each parcel of residential property, in lieu of this subsection, violate article IX, section 18, Constitution of Arizona. For those properties that qualify for property tax exemptions pursuant to article IX, section 2, Constitution of Arizona, eligibility for the credit is determined on the basis of the limited property value that corresponds to the taxable assessed value after reduction for the applicable exemption.  If the board of supervisors determines that such a situation exists, the board shall apply a credit against the primary property taxes due from each such parcel in the amount in excess of article IX, section 18, Constitution of Arizona. Such excess amounts shall also be additional state aid for education for the school district or districts in which the parcel of property is located.

F.

The additional state aid for education provided in this section shall be apportioned as provided in section 15-973.

I. If a parcel of property is owned by a cooperative apartment corporation or is owned by the tenants of a cooperative apartment corporation as tenants in common, the reduction in the property taxes prescribed in subsection D of this section shall not exceed the amounts listed in subsection D of this section for each owner-occupied housing unit on the property. The assessed value used for determining the reduction in taxes for the property is equal to the total assessed value of the property times the ratio of the number of owner-occupied housing units to the total number of housing units on the property. For the purposes of this subsection, "cooperative apartment corporation" means a corporation:

1. Having only one class of outstanding stock.

2. Of which all of the stockholders are entitled, solely by reason of their ownership of stock in the corporation, to occupy for dwelling purposes apartments in a building owned or leased by the corporation and that are not entitled, either conditionally or unconditionally, except on a complete or partial liquidation of the corporation, to receive any distribution not out of earnings and profits of the corporation.

3. Of which eighty percent or more of the gross income is derived from tenant-stockholders. For the purposes of this paragraph, "gross income" means gross income as defined by the United States internal revenue code, as defined in section 43-105.

J. The total amount of state monies that may be spent in any fiscal year for state aid for education in this section shall not exceed the amount appropriated or authorized by section 35-173 for that purpose.  This section does not impose a duty on an officer, agent or employee of this state to discharge a responsibility or create any right in a person or group if the discharge or right would require an expenditure of state monies in excess of the expenditure authorized by legislative appropriation for that specific purpose.

K. Notwithstanding subsection E of this section, the maximum amount of additional state aid for education that will be funded by this state pursuant to subsection E of this section shall be $1,000,000 per county.  For any county with a school district or districts that collectively would otherwise receive more than $1,000,000 in additional state aid for education pursuant to subsection E of this section, the property tax oversight commission established by section 42-17002 shall determine the proportion of the violation of article IX, section 18, Constitution of Arizona, that is attributable to each taxing jurisdiction within the affected school district or districts. Based on those proportions, the property tax oversight commission shall determine an amount that each taxing jurisdiction within the affected school district or districts shall transfer to the affected school district or districts during the fiscal year in order to compensate the affected school district or districts for its pro rata share of the reduction in additional state aid for education funding required by this subsection.  In determining the proportion of the violation of article IX, section 18, Constitution of Arizona, that is attributable to each taxing jurisdiction within the affected school district or districts, the property tax oversight commission shall assume a proportion of zero for any taxing jurisdiction that has a tax rate for the fiscal year that is equal to or less than the tax rate of peer jurisdictions, as determined by the property tax oversight commission.

L. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Owner" includes any purchaser under a contract of sale or under a deed of trust.

The separate question shall inform the voters that the monies will be credited to the debt service fund, and may therefore reduce the amount of the secondary property tax, if the measure authorizing the monies to be credited to the bond building fund does not pass.

(a) The available aggregate indebtedness capacity of the district under the statutes and constitution of this state.

(b) The principal amount authorized at the election for the district from which the issue of bonds is being sold.

E. Any net premium used as provided in subsection D, paragraph 3 of this section shall be amortized for all debt limitation purposes on a pro rata basis each year by multiplying the net premium used by a percentage equal to the percentage of the total principal amount of the bond issue that matures in that year.

Eligible employees initially appointed on or after August 9, 1974 shall elect to become members of the Arizona state retirement system or to participate in an optional retirement program established by the Arizona board of regents. The election shall be made in writing and filed with the Arizona state retirement system and the disbursing officer of the employing institution and shall be effective as of the effective date of appointment. If an eligible employee fails to make an election as provided in this paragraph, the eligible employee shall be deemed to have elected membership in the Arizona state retirement system.

2. Eligible employees initially appointed before August 9, 1974 may elect to participate in the optional retirement programs. The election shall be made in writing and filed with the Arizona state retirement system and the disbursing officer of the employing institution on or before December 14, 1974, shall become effective as of January 1, 1975 and shall constitute a waiver of all benefits provided by the Arizona state retirement system, except all such benefits as are expressly provided by law.

3. Any employee who becomes eligible may elect an optional retirement program. The election shall be made in writing and filed with the Arizona state retirement system and the disbursing officer of the employing institution within thirty days after notice in writing to the employee of the employee's eligibility, and shall become effective on the first day of the pay period following such election, and shall constitute a waiver of all benefits provided by the Arizona state retirement system, except all such benefits as are expressly provided by law.

4.

Additional contributions to the employee's retirement account shall not be required and continued service with the Arizona board of regents or an institution under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents while under an optional retirement program shall be deemed to be member service in the Arizona state retirement system for the purpose of determining eligibility for any benefits under such system. The amount of any such benefits under such system shall be computed only on the basis of service otherwise creditable to a member of the system and the employee's compensation during such service. For purposes of subsection D of this section, years of member service in the Arizona state retirement system shall count as years of service under the optional retirement programs.

The Arizona board of regents shall contribute public funds appropriated or any other funds available for such purpose on behalf of each participant in the optional retirement programs in an amount equal to seven per cent of the participant's compensation.

The appropriation to each university for purposes of enabling the Arizona board of regents to make the contribution provided in this subsection shall not exceed the employer contribution required under the Arizona state retirement system as prescribed by title 38, chapter 5, article 2. Funds utilized by the board of regents or by a university to pay that portion of the contribution that represents the difference between the employer contribution as prescribed by title 38, chapter 5, article 2 and the contribution rate provided in this subsection for an optional retirement program do not constitute a use of appropriated monies for supplemental retirement.

D. In the case of an electing employee initially appointed on or after August 9, 1974, contributions pursuant to subsection C of this section shall not be made by the Arizona board of regents until the employee's completion of five years of service. Employee contributions required during this initial five year period and during continued service with an institution under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents shall be promptly remitted to the optional retirement programs approved by the Arizona board of regents. At the end of an electing employee's completion of five years of service, a single contribution in an amount determined pursuant to subsection C of this section, with interest, shall be made by the chief financial officer of the employing institution to the approved company or companies on behalf of such employee. In the case of an electing employee who does not continue in service with an institution under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents for at least five years, the amount of employer contributions, with interest, shall be refunded to this state.

E. If an employee's service is terminated by death prior to the completion of five years of service, a death benefit equal to the sums appropriated for such employee, plus interest, shall be paid to the beneficiary designated by the participant under the participant's optional retirement program.

F. The provisions of subsection D of this section shall not apply to any electing employee who, at the time of initial appointment, owns a contract determined by the Arizona board of regents to be acceptable for use in the optional retirement program.

G. The Arizona board of regents may provide for the administration of such optional retirement programs and perform or authorize the performance of such functions as may be necessary for such purposes. The Arizona board of regents shall approve the company or companies from which benefits may be purchased under the optional retirement programs. Such optional retirement programs shall not permit loans. In giving its approval, the board shall consider:

3. The suitability of such rights and benefits to the needs of the participants and the interests of the institutions under its jurisdiction in the recruitment and retention of faculty and administrative officers.

H. Any eligible employee initially appointed after August 9, 1974, electing to participate in the optional retirement programs, shall be ineligible for membership in the Arizona state retirement system as long as the employee remains continuously employed in any position by the Arizona board of regents or by an institution under its jurisdiction, except as expressly provided by law.

I. The benefits, annuities and employee and employer contributions provided for in this section, and all interest, earnings and other credits pertaining to such benefits, annuities and contributions, shall not be subject to execution or attachment and shall be nonassignable. The employee and employer contributions provided for in this section and all interest, earnings and other credits pertaining to such contributions are exempt from state, county and municipal taxes. The benefits and annuities received by an employee under this section after December 31, 1988 are subject to tax pursuant to title 43.

J. Subject to amendment of the federal-state agreement provided for in section 38-702, every eligible employee electing to participate in the optional retirement programs shall have old age, survivors and disability insurance coverage provided by the federal social security act in accordance with the provisions of title 38, chapter 5, article 1.

Under such compacts, the following covenants may be agreed to:

ARTICLE I

Whereas, the future of this nation and of the western states is dependent upon the quality of the education of its youth; and

Whereas, many of the western states individually do not have sufficient numbers of potential students to warrant the establishment and maintenance within their borders of adequate facilities in all of the essential fields of technical, professional and graduate training, nor do all of the states have the financial ability to furnish within their borders institutions capable of providing acceptable standards of training in all of the fields mentioned above; and

Whereas, it is believed that the western states, or groups of such states within the region, cooperatively can provide acceptable and efficient educational facilities to meet the needs of the region and of the students thereof:

Now, therefore, the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming do hereby covenant and agree as follows:

ARTICLE II

Each of the compacting states and territories pledges to each of the other compacting states and territories faithful cooperation in carrying out all the purposes of this compact.

ARTICLE III

The compacting states and territories hereby create the western interstate commission for higher education, hereinafter called the commission. Said commission shall be a body corporate of each compacting state and territory and an agency thereof. The commission shall have all the powers and duties set forth herein, including the power to sue and be sued, and such additional powers as may be conferred upon it by subsequent action of the respective legislatures of the compacting states and territories.

ARTICLE IV

The commission shall consist of three resident members from each compacting state or territory. At all times one commissioner from each compacting state or territory shall be an educator engaged in the field of higher education in the state or territory from which he is appointed.

The commissioners from each state and territory shall be appointed by the governor thereof as provided by law in such state or territory. Any commissioner may be removed or suspended from office as provided by the law of the state or territory from which he shall have been appointed.

The terms of each commissioner shall be four years; provided however that the first three commissioners shall be appointed as follows: one for two years, one for three years and one for four years. Each commissioner shall hold office until his successor shall be appointed and qualified. If any office becomes vacant for any reason, the governor shall appoint a commissioner to fill the office for the remainder of the unexpired term.

ARTICLE V

Any business transacted at any meeting of the commission must be by affirmative vote of a majority of the whole number of compacting states and territories.

One or more commissioners from a majority of the compacting states and territories shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business.

Each compacting state and territory represented at any meeting of the commission is entitled to one vote.

ARTICLE VI

The commission shall elect from its number a chairman and a vice-chairman, and may appoint, and at its pleasure dismiss or remove, such officers, agents and employees as may be required to carry out the purpose of this compact; and shall fix and determine their duties, qualifications and compensation, having due regard for the importance of the responsibilities involved.

The commissioners shall serve without compensation but shall be reimbursed for their actual and necessary expenses from the funds of the commission.

ARTICLE VII

The commission shall adopt a seal and bylaws and shall adopt and promulgate rules and regulations for its management and control.

The commission may elect such committees as it deems necessary for the carrying out of its functions.

The commission shall establish and maintain an office within one of the compacting states for the transaction of its business and may meet at any time, but in any event must meet at least once a year. The chairman may call such additional meetings and upon the request of a majority of the commissioners of three or more compacting states or territories shall call additional meetings.

The commission shall submit a budget to the governor of each compacting state and territory at such time and for such period as may be required.

The commission shall, after negotiations with interested institutions, determine the cost of providing the facilities for graduate and professional education for use in its contractual agreements throughout the region.

On or before the fifteenth day of January of each year, the commission shall submit to the governors and legislatures of the compacting states and territories a report of its activities for the preceding calendar year.

The commission shall keep accurate books of account, showing in full its receipts and disbursements, and said books of account shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by the governor of any compacting state or territory or his designated representative. The commission shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedure of any of the compacting states or territories. The commission shall provide for an independent annual audit.

ARTICLE VIII

It shall be the duty of the commission to enter into such contractual agreements with any institutions in the region offering graduate or professional education and with any of the compacting states or territories as may be required in the judgment of the commission to provide adequate services and facilities of graduate and professional education for the citizens of the respective compacting states or territories. The commission shall first endeavor to provide adequate services and facilities in the fields of dentistry, medicine, public health and veterinary medicine and may undertake similar activities in other professional and graduate fields.

For this purpose the commission may enter into contractual agreements:

(a) With the governing authority of any educational institution in the region or with any compacting state or territory to provide such graduate or professional educational services upon terms and conditions to be agreed upon between contracting parties, and

(b) With the governing authority of any educational institution in the region or with any compacting state or territory to assist in the placement of graduate or professional students in educational institutions in the region providing the desired services and facilities, upon such terms and conditions as the commission may prescribe.

In conducting such studies, the commission may confer with any national or regional planning body which may be established. The commission shall draft and recommend to the governors of the various compacting states and territories uniform legislation dealing with problems of higher education in the region.

For the purposes of this compact the word "region" shall be construed to mean the geographical limits of the several compacting states and territories.

ARTICLE IX

The operating costs of the commission shall be apportioned equally among the compacting states and territories.

ARTICLE X

This compact shall become operative and binding immediately as to those states and territories adopting it whenever five or more of the states of Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming have duly adopted it prior to July 1, 1953. This compact shall become effective as to any additional states or territories adopting thereafter at the time of such adoption.

ARTICLE XI

This compact may be terminated at any time by consent of a majority of the compacting states or territories. Consent shall be manifested by passage and signature in the usual manner of legislation expressing such consent by the legislature and governor of such terminating state. Any state or territory may at any time withdraw from this compact by means of appropriate legislation to that end. Such withdrawal shall not become effective until two years after written notice thereof by the governor of the withdrawing state or territory, accompanied by a certified copy of the requisite legislative action, is received by the commission. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state or territory from its obligations hereunder accruing prior to the effective date of withdrawal. The withdrawing state or territory may rescind its action of withdrawal at any time within the two year period. Thereafter, the withdrawing state or territory may be reinstated by application to and the approval by a majority vote of the commission.

ARTICLE XII

If any compacting state or territory shall at any time default in the performance of any of its obligations assumed or imposed in accordance with the provisions of this compact, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact or agreements hereunder shall be suspended from the effective date of such default as fixed by the commission.

Unless such default shall be remedied within a period of two years following the effective date of such default, this compact may be terminated with respect to such defaulting state or territory by affirmative vote of three-fourths of the other member states or territories.

That if the student does not begin practice in this state within the time prescribed in this section but shall have repaid an agreed part of the sum expended by this state in his behalf, the board may permit him to discharge the balance of his obligation by subsequent practice within this state.

5. That in the event of the death of the student during the period of his education, internship or practice, his obligation to this state under this article shall cease except as to any portion that is then due.
