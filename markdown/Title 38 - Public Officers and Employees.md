C. Officers shall not approve any bond when the financial standing and ability of the sureties thereon are unknown to them, or when any of the sureties thereon are assessed for the current year for taxes upon property the aggregate value of which is less than the amount for which the surety becomes liable upon the bond, unless either:

1. The surety is first examined under oath before the officer authorized to approve the bond concerning the surety's ability to respond in damages.

Every official bond executed by an officer pursuant to law is in force and obligatory upon the principal and sureties therein for any and all breaches of the conditions thereof committed during the time the officer continues to discharge any of the duties of or hold the office, whether the breaches are committed or suffered by the principal officer, his deputy or clerk. When, except in criminal prosecutions, a penalty, forfeiture or liability is imposed on any officer for nonperformance or malperformance of official duty, the liability therefor attaches to the official bond of the officer, and to the principal and sureties thereon.  Every such bond is in force and obligatory upon the principal and sureties therein for the faithful discharge of all duties which may be required of the officer by any law enacted subsequently to the execution of the bond, and such condition shall be expressed therein.

#### Section 38-260. Beneficiaries of bond

Every official bond executed by any officer pursuant to law, is in force and obligatory upon the principal and sureties therein to and for the state and to and for the use and benefit of all persons who may be injured or aggrieved by the wrongful act or default of the officer in his official capacity. Any person so injured or aggrieved may bring an action on the bond in his own name without an assignment thereof.

#### Section 38-261. Successive recoveries

No bond is void on the first recovery of a judgment thereon, but action may afterwards be brought on the bond from time to time by the state, or by any person injured, and judgment recovered thereon until the whole penalty of the bond is exhausted.

#### Section 38-262. Defects in form, approval or filing of bond

When an official bond does not contain the substantial matter or conditions required by law, or when there are any defects in the approval or filing thereof, such defects shall not discharge the officer and his sureties, and they are bound to the state, or party injured, according to the conditions and obligations required by law to be inserted therein. The state or the injured party may in an action upon the bond, suggest the defect in the bond, approval or filing, and recover the proper and equitable demand or damages from the officer and the persons who intended to become and were included as sureties in the bond.

#### Section 38-263. Additional bond; failure to file

A. When a surety on any official bond moves from the state, becomes insolvent or insufficient, or the penalty on the bond becomes insufficient, the person approving the bond shall, of his own motion, or on the showing of any person, supported by an affidavit, at once notify any such officer to appear before him at a time stated, not less than three nor more than ten days after the service of the notice, and show cause why he should not execute a new or additional bond with good and sufficient sureties.

B. After hearing thereon, either party aggrieved by the decision may appeal to the judge of the superior court of the county in which the bond is filed, and in the absence of the judge, to the court commissioner of the county, who shall proceed to hear the matter summarily and decide the case, and such decision shall be final. If the officer fails to appear, the matter may be heard in his absence, and if any officer, when required to do so, fails to file a new or additional bond, his office shall be deemed vacant.

#### Section 38-264. Additional bond; terms

The new or additional bond shall be in the penalty directed by the person approving the original bond, in all respects similar to, and approved by and filed with the same officer as the original bond. When so filed it shall be of like force from the date of its execution and subject the officer and his sureties to the same liabilities as the original bond.

#### Section 38-265. Liability on original and additional bonds

The original bond is not discharged or affected by the giving of new or additional bond, but remains of like force and obligation as if the new or additional bond had not been given. The officer and his sureties are liable upon either or both bonds, and an action may be brought upon either bond, or separate actions on both bonds, and the same cause of action may be alleged and judgment recovered in each action.

#### Section 38-266. Judgment on original and additional bonds; contribution of sureties

A. If separate judgments are recovered on the bonds for the same cause of action, the plaintiff is entitled to have execution issued on both judgments, but he shall only collect by execution or otherwise the amount actually adjudged to him on the same causes of action, together with the costs of both actions.

B. When the sureties on either bond have been compelled to pay any amount of money on account of the principal obligor therein, they are entitled to recover of the sureties on the remaining bond, a distributive part of the amount thus paid, in the proportion which the penalties of the bonds bear one to the other, and to the amount thus paid, respectively.

#### Section 38-267. Discharge of sureties

A. When any sureties on the official bond of an officer wish to be discharged from their liability, they and such officer may procure such discharge if the officer will execute a new bond to be approved and filed as the original bond. Upon the filing and approval of the new bond, the first sureties are exonerated from all further liability, but their bond remains in full force as to all liabilities incurred previous to the approval of the new bond.

B. The liability of the sureties in each new bond is in all respects the same and may be enforced in like manner as the liability of the sureties in the original bond.

#### Section 38-268. Bonds of persons appointed to fill vacancies

Any person appointed to fill a vacancy, before entering upon the duties of the office, shall give a bond as required of the officer originally elected or appointed.

#### Section 38-269. Withdrawal of surety; effect on remaining sureties

A. Any surety on the official bond of any officer may be relieved from liabilities thereon afterwards accruing by complying with the following provisions:

1. The surety shall file with the person authorized by law to approve the official bond, a sworn statement in writing setting forth his desire to be relieved from liability thereon afterwards arising, and the reasons therefor.

2. Serve notice of the filing of the statement on the officer named in the official bond, and make return or affidavit of service thereon and file it with the approving officer.

B. Within ten days after the service of the notice, the person authorized to approve the bond shall make an order declaring such office vacant, and releasing the surety from all liability thereafter to arise on the official bond, and the office thereafter is in law vacant, and shall be immediately filled by election or appointment, as in other cases of vacancy, unless the officer has before that time given good and ample surety for the discharge of all his official duties as originally required.

C. The release, discharge, voluntary withdrawal or incompetency of the surety on any official bond, does not affect the bond as to the remaining sureties thereon, or alter or change their liability.

#### Section 38-270. Supplemental bond upon withdrawal of surety; exception

A. When a surety on any official bond gives notice of intention to withdraw therefrom, or is removed or becomes insolvent or becomes otherwise incompetent, the principal shall, within ten days after the notice or disqualification, execute and file, subject to the same conditions as the original, a supplemental bond, in which shall be recited the names of the remaining original sureties, and the name of the new surety, and the amount for which he becomes bound, who is substituted in lieu of the surety released or disqualified.

B. When the original bond is given for an amount in excess of the amount required by law, if the withdrawal or removal of any surety does not reduce the bond below the amount required by law to be secured by sureties, then no supplemental or additional bond is necessary. Until the filing and approval of the supplemental bond, the sureties withdrawing or removed on the formed bond are liable for all the acts of their principals.

#### Section 38-271. Effect of withdrawal on liability of surety

No surety shall be released from liability for acts, omissions or causes existing or which arose before the making of the order discharging him, but legal proceedings may be had therefor in all respects as though no such order had been made.

#### Section 38-272. Affidavit of plaintiff in action to recover on bond that defendant owns real property; notice to recorder

After an action has been commenced to recover upon any bond required to be given by a public officer, the plaintiff may file an affidavit stating either positively or on information and belief that the bond was executed by the defendant, and that the defendant has real property, designating the county or counties in which it is located. The clerk receiving the affidavit shall certify to the recorder of the county in which the real estate is located the names of the parties to the action, the name of the court in which the action is pending and the amount claimed in the complaint, with the date of the commencement of the action.

#### Section 38-273. Recording notice of ownership of real property; lien of judgment

Upon receiving the certificate the county recorder shall endorse, file and record it in the same manner as notices of the pendency of an action affecting real estate. Any judgment recovered in such action is a lien upon all real estate belonging to the defendant and located in any county in which the certificate is filed for the amount that the owner thereof is or may be liable upon the judgment, from the time of filing the certificate.

1. Requests for proposals for health insurance that specify that the carrier's proposed premiums for each plan be based on the expected age, gender and health status of the entire pool of employees and officers and their family members enrolled in all qualifying plans and not on the age, gender or health status of the individuals expected to enroll in the particular plan for which the premium is proposed.

Before monies are presumed abandoned, ASRS shall attempt to contact the apparent owner in writing.  If the apparent owner is a member, beginning five years before the apparent owner's required beginning date of distributions pursuant to section 38-775 and for three years after that date, ASRS shall annually send a notice to the apparent owner notifying the apparent owner of the owner's eligibility for a retirement benefit.  If the apparent owner is a beneficiary, beginning in the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member’s death and for three years, ASRS shall annually send a notice to the apparent owner notifying the apparent owner of the owner’s eligibility for a survivor benefit.  If this notice is returned by the postal authority as undeliverable, ASRS shall make a good faith attempt to locate the apparent owner, including contacting any known beneficiary on record with ASRS, searching public databases to identify the address of the apparent owner or using the services of a third-party address verification service.  If the good faith attempt to locate the apparent owner fails and the base amount of the unclaimed monies is three hundred dollars or more, ASRS may use the services of a people search service.  A fee imposed by the people search service shall not be deducted from the member's benefit and these expenditures are continuously appropriated and shall be paid from the administration account established pursuant to section 38-721 in the amount deemed necessary by the board.

F. If at any time an owner, as defined in section 44-301, establishes an entitlement in the monies, ASRS shall withdraw the monies from either the ASRS trust fund or the LTD trust fund, whichever is applicable, and pay the owner the monies or benefit to which the owner is entitled pursuant to this article or article 2.1 of this chapter, including interest at a rate determined by ASRS, if applicable.

A. The governing body of any political subdivision may adopt, by appropriate legislation, a supplemental retirement plan for employees and officers of the political subdivision. The supplemental retirement plan shall provide the same retirement benefits and require the same obligations for entitlement as are provided for other members under this article, except that:

1. The supplemental retirement plan shall specify the date of commencement of the supplemental retirement plan as the first day of the month following board approval of the supplemental plan of the political subdivision as provided in this section.

2. Employer and employee obligations shall be paid to ASRS in accordance with that date.

B. The governing body of the political subdivision shall submit the supplemental retirement plan to the board in the form of an agreement.

The board shall either approve or disapprove the supplemental retirement plan submitted by the governing body of the political subdivision.

C. On approval, the board shall administer the supplemental plan of the political subdivision.

D. The employer's share of contributions and payments in excess of those required of the employer under section 38-737 shall be paid from monies of the political subdivision.

E. On establishment of the supplemental retirement plan the governing body of the political subdivision shall deduct member contributions in the same amounts and in the same manner as provided in this article for state employees and shall pay those contributions, together with the employer contributions for the political subdivision, to ASRS for deposit in the ASRS depository. The governing body of the political subdivision shall reimburse ASRS in a similar manner for its pro rata share of administrative costs attributable to coverage of employees of the political subdivision.

F. In addition to the employer contributions required under section 38-737, on establishment of the supplemental retirement plan the governing body of the political subdivision shall pay to ASRS the amount equal to the present value required to fund additional costs of benefits attributable to service for the political subdivision before the effective date of the supplemental retirement plan using the actuarial assumptions that are approved by the board. The board may authorize payments to be made at such times as the board requires and in amounts that are less than the amount required for fully funding the additional costs.

G. If the supplemental retirement plan is authorized by a political subdivision, then on or after the effective date of the supplemental retirement plan the governing body of the political subdivision and the board may sign an agreement to waive the provisions of subsection F of this section and to authorize benefits under the supplemental retirement plan only for service with the political subdivision after the effective date of the supplemental retirement plan. In lieu of waiving benefits for all service before the effective date of the supplemental retirement plan, the governing body of the political subdivision may elect to waive benefits for a portion of that service. Amendments to the agreement may increase but shall not reduce the service for which a member is entitled to benefits. The governing body of the political subdivision shall certify for each member the years of service before the effective date of the supplemental retirement plan for which the member is entitled to benefits. In addition to the employer contributions required in section 38-737, the governing body of the political subdivision shall pay to ASRS the amount, as determined by the board, required to fund the cost of the benefits attributable to service before the effective date of the supplemental retirement plan for which members are entitled to benefits.

H. The new political subdivision shall designate the classification of employees that is eligible for membership in ASRS and shall make contributions each year as provided in this section.

I. The liability of the political subdivision providing a supplemental retirement plan within ASRS arises in consideration of the officer's or employee's retention in or entrance into service for the political subdivision.

J. Notwithstanding any other law, an employee of a political subdivision who was previously a member of another public employee retirement system and who receives or is eligible to receive retirement benefits from that public employee retirement system for any period of employment is ineligible to receive service credit from ASRS for the same period of employment.

#### Section 38-730. Charter city or ASRS retirement service credits; transfers

A. On application the retirement service credits of an employee of a charter city that is not an employer under ASRS or an employee of an employer that is an employer under ASRS whose job functions are shifted by law from one employer jurisdiction to another shall be transferred to the retirement system of the new employer.

B. An employee of a charter city that is not an employer under ASRS or an employee of an employer that is an employer under ASRS who becomes employed by the other employer jurisdiction may apply to have the employee's retirement service credits transferred to the retirement system of the new employer.  The retirement service credits of an employee of a charter city that is not an employer under ASRS shall not be transferred unless the governing body of that city approves the transfer. The retirement service credits of an employee of an employer that is an employer under ASRS shall not be transferred unless the board approves the transfer.

C. The transfer shall be made pursuant to section 38-922.

D. The accumulated retirement contributions of an employee whose retirement service credits are transferred that are paid to the retirement system of the new employer shall not be withdrawn by the employee unless the employee's employment terminates.

#### Section 38-735. Payment of contributions; recovery of delinquent payments

C. Payments made by employers pursuant to this article or article 2.1, 7 or 8 of this chapter become delinquent after the due date prescribed in the board's rules and thereafter shall be increased by interest from and after that date until payment is received by ASRS. ASRS shall charge interest on the delinquent payments at an annual rate equal to the interest rate assumption approved by the board from time to time for actuarial equivalency. Delinquent payments due under this article or article 2.1, 7 or 8 of this chapter, together with interest charges as provided in this subsection, may be recovered by action in a court of competent jurisdiction against an employer that is liable for payments or, at the request of the director, may be deducted from any other monies, including excise revenue taxes, payable to the employer by any department or agency of this state.  The employer shall record delinquent payments that are recovered or deducted from other monies pursuant to this subsection pursuant to applicable accounting and financial reporting standards.

 

#### Section 38-736. Member contributions

A. Member contributions are required as a condition of employment and shall be made by payroll deductions. Member contributions shall begin simultaneously with membership in ASRS.

Amounts so deducted by employers shall be deposited in the ASRS depository.

B. The employer shall pay the member contributions required of members on account of compensation earned. The paid contributions shall be treated as employer contributions for the purpose of determining tax treatment under the internal revenue code. The effective date of the employer payment shall not be before the date ASRS has received notification from the United States internal revenue service that pursuant to section 414(h) of the internal revenue code the member contributions paid will not be included in gross income for income tax purposes until the paid contributions are distributed by refund or retirement benefit payments. The employer shall pay the member contributions from monies that are established and available in the retirement deduction account and that would otherwise have been designated as member contributions and paid to ASRS. Member contributions paid pursuant to this subsection shall be treated for all other purposes, in the same manner and to the same extent, as member contributions made before the approval of the United States internal revenue service pursuant to this section.

Beginning July 1, 2011 through June 29, 2016, the total employer contribution shall be determined on the projected unit credit method. Beginning June 30, 2016, the board shall determine the actuarial cost method pursuant to section 38-714.

5. 401(a) pension contributions that the employer prepays and accrued earnings may be used solely to reduce the employer's future 401(a) pension contributions as required from the employer pursuant to this section and section 38-735.

6. The employer shall determine when to use the 401(a) pension contributions the employer prepays and the accrued earnings from those 401(a) pension contributions.

7. ASRS shall provide the employer an annual statement of 401(a) pension contributions the employer prepaid and the accrued earnings.

8. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, an employer may not prepay 401(a) pension contributions according to this subsection either:

(a) In an amount greater than the employer's net pension liability as reflected by ASRS in its most recent applicable governmental accounting standards report.

(b) After the total of the unamortized prepaid 401(a) pension contributions and the accrued earnings is equal to or greater than the employer's net pension liability as reflected by ASRS in its most recent applicable governmental accounting standards report.

9. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the employer shall elect an amortization schedule by written agreement with ASRS, and the amortization period shall begin in the fiscal year following the occurrence of the earlier of:

(a) The employer's net pension liability is zero or less as reflected by ASRS in its most recent applicable governmental accounting standards report.

(b) The total of the unamortized prepaid 401(a) pension contributions and the accrued earnings is equal to or greater than the employer's net pension liability as reflected by ASRS in its most recent applicable governmental accounting standards report.

10. After an employer elects amortization terms, ASRS shall provide the employer an amortization schedule annually that is current and based on the employer's election.

11. If ASRS determines to no longer offer the option of prepaying the employer's 401(a) pension contributions directly to ASRS, any 401(a) pension contributions the employer prepays and the accrued earnings remaining on account shall be used for future obligations according to the written agreement between the employer and ASRS.

12. Assets transferred in or out of or held in the ASRS trust fund established by section 38-712, or a section 115 trust, and the accrued earnings are exempt from state, county and municipal taxes.

13. The legislature intends that the accrued earnings not be subject to federal income tax. ASRS may adopt additional rules, policies and procedures as ASRS deems necessary or appropriate to fulfill the legislature's intent that the accrued earnings not be subject to federal income tax.

14. If ASRS receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that this subsection or any portion of this subsection will jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the 401(a) pension contributions the employer prepays according to this subsection and the accrued earnings, the portion of this subsection that will cause the disqualification does not apply.

E. For the purposes of this section:

1. "401(a) pension contributions" means the portion of an employer's pension contribution that is specific to the retirement program established under this article and qualified under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code.

#### Section 38-738. Adjustment and refund

A. If more than the correct amount of employer or member contributions is paid into ASRS by an employer through a mistake of fact, ASRS shall provide the employer with an employer credit against future contributions if the employer requests an employer credit or, if the request is made within one year after the date of overpayment, shall return the contributions to the employer. ASRS may not pay an employer earnings attributable to the excess contributions but shall reduce the amount returned to an employer pursuant to this subsection by the amount of losses attributable to the excess contributions. If more than the correct amount of employer or member contributions is paid into ASRS by an employer through a mistake of law, ASRS shall provide the employer with an employer credit against future contributions if the employer requests an employer credit.  On receipt of an employer credit or return of contributions pursuant to this subsection, the employer shall return any member portion of the returned contributions to the member.

B. If less than the correct amount of employer or member contributions is paid into ASRS by an employer, the following apply:

1. The member shall pay an amount that is equal to the amount that would have been paid in member contributions for the period in question.  For active members, payments shall be made as provided in section 38-747.  For members who are inactive, retired or on long-term disability, payments shall be made using after-tax income and a personal check, cashier's check or money order. If the member does not make the payment within ninety days after being notified by ASRS that the employer has paid all amounts due from the employer, the unpaid amount accrues interest until the amount is paid in full. The member is responsible for payment of the unpaid amount and interest. The interest rate is the interest rate assumption that is approved by the board for actuarial equivalency for the period in question to the date payment is received.

2. If the member contributions to ASRS made pursuant to this subsection exceed the limits prescribed in section 38-747, subsection E when taking into account other annual additions of the member for the limitation year, the amount to be paid by the member shall be adjusted as provided in section 38-747. For the purposes of this paragraph, "limitation year" has the same meaning prescribed in section 38-769.

3. The employer shall pay to ASRS an amount equal to the amount that would have been paid in employer contributions for the period in question together with accumulated interest that would have accrued on both the employer and member contributions due.  If the employer does not remit full payment of all employer contributions and all interest due within ninety days after being notified by ASRS of the amount due, the unpaid amount accrues interest until the amount is paid in full. The interest rate is the interest rate assumption that is approved by the board for actuarial equivalency for the period in question to the date payment is received.

4. On satisfaction of the requirements of this subsection, the member's salary history on the records of ASRS shall be adjusted and any additional service credits acquired by the member shall be reinstated.

5. If the member retires before all contributions are made pursuant to this subsection, the member's benefits shall be calculated only based on the contributions actually made.

6. Annual additions shall be determined as provided in section 38-747, subsection O.

7. The initiator of the request for correction of salary history and service credits on records of ASRS is responsible for providing credible evidence of past employment and compensation to ASRS in a form or forms that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that a period of employment occurred under circumstances that made the employee eligible for membership in ASRS during that period.  A determination of eligibility by ASRS may be appealed to the ASRS board in a manner prescribed by the board.

8. A member who previously received a return of contributions pursuant to section 38-740 may receive an adjustment of employer contributions or service credits pursuant to this section only for qualifying employment and compensation that occurred after the member's most recent return of contributions pursuant to section 38-740.

C. Subsection B of this section applies to eligible verified service that occurred less than or equal to fifteen years before the date the initiator of the request for correction of salary history and service credits on the records of ASRS provides ASRS with credible evidence in writing that less than the correct amount of contributions was paid into ASRS or ASRS otherwise determines that less than the correct amount of contributions was made.

D. Eligible verified service that is more than fifteen years before the date the initiator of the request for correction of salary history and service credits on the records of ASRS provides ASRS with credible evidence in writing that less than the correct amount of contributions was paid into ASRS or ASRS otherwise determines that less than the correct amount of contributions was made is considered public service credit.  The member may purchase this service pursuant to section 38-743.

E. Notwithstanding any other law, an employer may correct a contributions error pursuant to subsection B of this section by making payment adjustments through the employer's payroll reporting for the contributions that were not submitted if both of the following apply:

1. The adjustment is made within the same fiscal year that the contributions were due to ASRS.

2. The employer obtains written consent from the employee to make the adjustment to the employee's paycheck.

F. Notwithstanding any other law, if an employer pays less than the correct amount of employer or member contributions into ASRS, the correct amount of member contributions may not be paid to ASRS after the death of the member.

#### Section 38-739. Credited service

A. A member shall not earn more than one year of credited service in any fiscal year.

B. A member shall earn proportionate credited service for each month for which the member performs service and is compensated equal to the ratio that the month bears to the number of months in the member's service year.

Consistent with the compliance statement issued by the United States internal revenue service, an employee who is employed with an ASRS employer in a position that was exempt from ASRS membership because the position was not included in agreements providing for the employee's coverage under the federal old-age and survivors insurance system but on whose behalf the employer has remitted ASRS contributions shall retain credited service for the period of employment for which the employer remitted ASRS contributions on the employee's behalf.

2. If a member has five or more years of credited service, ASRS shall disburse the member's contributions and an amount equal to a percentage of the employer contributions paid on behalf of the member.  This amount excludes payments made by an employer pursuant to section 38-738, subsection B, paragraph 3, unless the member has made the payment required by section 38-738, subsection B, paragraph 1.

D. Withdrawal of contributions with interest constitutes a withdrawal from membership in ASRS and results in a forfeiture of all other benefits under ASRS.

E. If ASRS has disbursed an overpayment pursuant to section 38-765 or 38-797.08, ASRS shall withhold the overpayment amount plus any required income tax withholding from the return of contributions.

A. If an active member who received a return of contributions on termination of employment and by receipt of those contributions forfeited credited service earned on that employment, as provided in section 38-740, subsection A or B, is subsequently reemployed by an employer, the member's service shall be credited only from the date the member's most recent reemployment period commenced.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the member may redeposit the amount of the contributions the ASRS paid at the time of the member's separation from service, with interest on that amount to the date of redeposit at the interest rate assumption approved by the board for actuarial equivalency. On satisfaction of this obligation, the member's service credits acquired by the previous employment shall be reinstated. The member is subject to the benefits and duties in effect at the time of the member's most recent reemployment except as provided in section 38-711, paragraph 5, subdivision (a). If a member redeposits less than the amount required under this subsection, ASRS shall proportionately reduce the member's reinstated service credits.

A. Except as provided in subsection E, beginning on July 1, 2002, the annual compensation of each employee taken into account under ASRS for any fiscal year or for any other specified twelve consecutive month period shall not exceed two hundred thousand dollars.  In determining benefit accruals under ASRS for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2001 and except as provided for in subsection E, the annual compensation limit under this subsection for fiscal years beginning before January 1, 2002 is two hundred thousand dollars.

B. If compensation under ASRS is determined on a period of time that contains fewer than twelve calendar months, the compensation limit for that period of time is equal to the dollar limit for the calendar year during which the period of time begins, multiplied by the fraction in which the numerator is the number of full months in that period of time and the denominator is twelve.

C. For fiscal years beginning before July 1, 1997, the annual compensation limit prescribed in this section also applies to the combined compensation of a member who is a member of the group of ten highly compensated employees, as defined in section 414(q) of the internal revenue code, and who is paid the highest compensation during the fiscal year and any family member of the member who is either the member's spouse or the member's lineal descendant and who has not attained the age of nineteen before the close of the fiscal year.  If the maximum compensation is adjusted pursuant to subsection D, the adjusted limitation shall be prorated among the affected members' compensation determined pursuant to this section before application of the adjusted limitation to the other provisions of this article.

D. The board shall adjust the maximum compensation under subsection A at the same time and in the same manner as adjusted by the United States secretary of the treasury under section 401(a)(17)(B) of the internal revenue code.  The adjustment under this subsection for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the fiscal year of ASRS that begins with or within the calendar year.

E. The dollar limitation prescribed in subsection A does not apply to an eligible member to the extent that the annual compensation of an eligible member taken into account by ASRS for any fiscal year or for any other specified twelve consecutive month period would be reduced below two hundred thirty-five thousand eight hundred forty dollars. This was the amount of compensation taken into account by ASRS as of July 1, 1993. The board shall adjust this amount as of the effective date of the increase prescribed by the United States secretary of the treasury. For the purposes of this subsection, "eligible member" means a person who first became a member of ASRS before July 1, 1996.

#### Section 38-747. Purchase of credited service; payment; limitations; definitions

A. A member who purchases credited service pursuant to section 38-738, 38-742, 38-743, 38-744, 38-745 or 38-922 shall either:

1. Make payments directly to ASRS as provided in subsection H of this section.

2. Elect to have the member's employer make payments as provided in subsection B of this section.

B. A member may elect to have the member's employer make payments for all or any portion of the amounts payable for the member's purchase of credited service pursuant to the sections prescribed in subsection A of this section through a salary reduction program in accordance with the following:

1. The amounts paid pursuant to a salary reduction program are in lieu of contributions by the electing member. The electing member's salary or other compensation shall be reduced by the amount paid by the employer pursuant to this subsection. For the purposes of this paragraph, "other compensation" includes a member's termination pay.

2. The member shall make an election pursuant to this subsection at any time on or after the date the member elects to purchase credited service pursuant to the sections prescribed in subsection A of this section and before the member's termination of employment.  The election shall specify the number of payroll periods that deductions will be made from the member's compensation and the dollar amount of deductions for each payroll period during the specified number of payroll periods.  In the case of an election to utilize all or any part of the member's termination pay to purchase credited service, the member's election shall be made at least three full calendar months before the date of the member's termination of employment and entitlement to receive the termination pay. After an election is made pursuant to this subsection, the election is binding on and irrevocable for the member and the member's employer during the member's remaining period of current employment.  After a member makes an irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection, the member does not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly. For the purposes of this paragraph, "termination pay" means any lump sum that is paid at the member's termination of employment for accrued vacation, sick leave or overtime pay.

3. A member who makes an irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection to have the member's employer make payments for less than all of the amounts payable for the member's purchase of credited service may irrevocably elect to have the member's employer make payments for all or any portion of the remaining amounts payable for the member's purchase of credited service. A member who makes one or more irrevocable elections pursuant to this subsection may also make other contributions to ASRS pursuant to subsection H of this section to the extent of any remaining amounts payable for which the member has not made an election pursuant to this subsection. An additional election or contribution with respect to a portion of the amounts payable for the member's purchase of credited service does not alter, amend or revoke an irrevocable election already made pursuant to this subsection for any other portion of the amounts payable for the member's purchase of credited service.

4. If on termination of the member's employment with an ASRS employer all amounts have not been paid to ASRS pursuant to the member's irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection, the member may pay ASRS, within thirty days after the member's termination of employment and subject to other limitations prescribed in this section, all or any portion of the unpaid amounts as provided in subsection H of this section.  These payments do not alter, amend or revoke any irrevocable election already made pursuant to this subsection with respect to any amount to be paid by the member's employer while the member is employed by the member's employer.

5. Amounts paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as employer contributions for the purpose of determining tax treatment under the internal revenue code.  The effective date of employer payments pursuant to this subsection shall not be before the date ASRS receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the internal revenue code the amounts paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection will not be included in the member's gross income for income tax purposes until those amounts are distributed by refund or retirement benefit payments.

6. Unless otherwise provided, member contributions paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection are treated for all other purposes under ASRS in the same manner and to the same extent as member contributions that are not paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection. ASRS shall not grant credited service for contributions made pursuant to this subsection until those contributions are received by ASRS. ASRS may assess interest or administrative charges attributable to any salary reduction election made pursuant to this subsection.  The interest or administrative charges shall be added to the amount of contributions that is made to ASRS by the member each payroll period and that is paid by the member's employer.  The interest or administrative charges shall not be treated as member contributions for any purposes under this article and a member or a member's beneficiary does not have a right to the return of the interest or administrative charges pursuant to any other provision of this article.  Interest assessed pursuant to this subsection shall be at the rate specified by the board pursuant to section 38-711, paragraph 2.

7. If a member transfers employment from one participating employer with which the member has made an irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection to another participating employer, the member and the successor participating employer shall complete the terms of the irrevocable election that the member made with the original participating employer.

C. A member who elects before July 1, 1999 to receive retirement benefits based on section 38-771, subsection C, paragraph 2 or a member who elects to make contributions to ASRS pursuant to section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4 shall either make the member's additional contributions required pursuant to section 38-771, subsection E or allowed pursuant to section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4 directly to ASRS as provided in subsection H of this section or shall elect to have the member's employer make payments for those additional contributions as provided in subsection D of this section.  A member who elected to be covered or who was deemed to be covered by section 38-771 on or before December 31, 1995 or who elects to make member contributions pursuant to section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 3 is deemed to have made an irrevocable election pursuant to subsection D of this section to make the member's contributions to ASRS that are required by section 38-771, subsection D or allowed by section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 3.

D. Any member contributions that are required by section 38-771, subsection D or that are allowed pursuant to section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 3 are deemed to be made by the member to ASRS through a salary reduction program in accordance with the following:

1. A member may make member contributions pursuant to section 38-771, subsection E or section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4 through a salary reduction program elected pursuant to this subsection.  If a member makes an irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection before July 1, 1999 to have the member's employer make payments for additional contributions pursuant to section 38-771, subsection E, the election continues in effect from and after June 30, 1999 and shall not be revoked, amended or altered by any election made pursuant to section 38-771.01 or otherwise.  The amounts paid pursuant to a salary reduction program are in lieu of contributions by the electing member.  The member's salary or other compensation shall be reduced by the amount paid by the employer pursuant to this subsection.

2. Before a member's termination of employment, the member may make an election pursuant to this subsection at any time after the date the member elects to receive retirement benefits based on section 38-771, subsection C, paragraph 2 but before July 1, 1999 or at any time after the member elects to make member contributions pursuant to section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4.  The election shall specify the number of payroll periods that deductions will be made from the member's compensation and the dollar amount of deductions for each payroll period during the specified number of payroll periods.  After an election is made pursuant to this subsection, the election is binding on and irrevocable for the member and the member's employer during the member's remaining period of employment.

3. After a member makes or is deemed to have made an irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection, the member does not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly.  A member who makes an irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection to have the member's employer make payments for less than all of the amounts payable for the member's additional contributions allowed by section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4 may irrevocably elect to have the member's employer make payments for all or any portion of the remaining amounts payable for the member's additional contributions. A member who makes one or more irrevocable elections pursuant to this subsection may also make other contributions to ASRS pursuant to section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4 or pursuant to subsection H of this section to the extent of any remaining amounts payable for which the member has not made an election pursuant to this subsection. An additional election or contribution with respect to a portion of the amounts payable for the member's additional contributions pursuant to section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4 does not alter, amend or revoke an irrevocable election already made pursuant to this subsection for any other portion of the amounts payable for the member's additional contributions allowed by section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4.

4. If on termination of the member's employment all amounts have not been paid to ASRS pursuant to the member's irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection, the member may pay ASRS, within thirty days after the member's termination of employment and subject to other limitations prescribed in this section, all or any portion of the unpaid amounts as provided in subsection H of this section.  These payments do not alter, amend or revoke any irrevocable election already made pursuant to this subsection with respect to any amount to be paid by the member's employer while the member is employed by the member's employer.

5. Amounts paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as employer contributions for the purpose of determining tax treatment under the internal revenue code.  The effective date of employer payments pursuant to this subsection shall not be before the date ASRS receives notification from the United States internal revenue service that pursuant to section 414(h)(2) of the internal revenue code the amounts paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection will not be included in the member's gross income for income tax purposes until those amounts are distributed by refund or retirement benefit payments.

6. Unless otherwise provided, member contributions paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection are treated for all other purposes under ASRS in the same manner and to the same extent as member contributions that are not paid by an employer pursuant to this subsection.

7. If a member transfers employment from one participating employer with which the member has made an irrevocable election pursuant to this subsection to another participating employer, the member and the successor participating employer shall complete the terms of the irrevocable election that the member made with the original participating employer.

E. The following limits apply to contributions to ASRS:

1. Except to the extent paragraphs 2 and 3 of this subsection apply to certain contributions made by a member to ASRS and to the extent permitted under section 414(v) of the internal revenue code, if applicable, in any one limitation year, the annual additions contributed or allocated to ASRS for or on behalf of a member shall not exceed the lesser of either:

(a) $40,000 or a larger amount that is prescribed by the board and that is due to any cost of living adjustment announced by the United States secretary of the treasury pursuant to section 415(d) of the internal revenue code.  The board shall increase the amount prescribed by this subdivision as of the effective date of the increase announced by the United States secretary of the treasury.

(b) One hundred percent of the member's compensation for the limitation year.  The compensation limit prescribed in this subdivision does not apply to any contribution to ASRS for medical benefits after a member's separation from service, within the meaning prescribed in section 401(h) or 419A(f)(2) of the internal revenue code, that is otherwise treated as an annual addition.

2. Unless paragraph 4 of this subsection applies, for plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1998, in any one limitation year, the annual additions credited to ASRS for or on behalf of a member who makes contributions to ASRS to purchase credited service pursuant to section 38-743, 38-744, 38-745 or 38-922 and with respect to which an irrevocable election has not been made pursuant to subsection B of this section shall not exceed the greater of either:

(a) The requirements of section 38-769. For the purposes of applying the limits prescribed in section 38-769 under this subdivision, the accrued benefit derived from the contributions shall be treated as an annual benefit and the reduced limit for certain early retirement in section 38-769, subsection C, paragraph 2 does not apply.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph 3 of this subsection, the requirements of paragraph 1 of this subsection.  The contributions shall be treated as annual additions and any of the member's other annual additions for the limitation year shall be taken into account. For the purposes of applying the requirements of paragraph 1 of this subsection under this subdivision, the percentage of compensation limit in paragraph 1, subdivision (b) of this paragraph does not apply.

3. For plan years beginning on or after July 1, 1998, the requirements of paragraph 1 of this subsection shall not be applied to reduce the amount of credited service that may be purchased by an eligible member pursuant to section 38-743, 38-744, 38-745 or 38-922 to an amount that is less than the amount of credited service allowed to be purchased pursuant to those sections on August 5, 1997 without the application of any of the limits prescribed in this section or section 415 of the internal revenue code.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "eligible member" means a person who first becomes a member of ASRS before July 1, 1999.

4. Member contributions to ASRS to purchase credited service pursuant to section 38-743, 38-744 or 38-922 shall not be made by a member if recognition of that service would cause a member to receive a retirement benefit for the same service from ASRS and one or more other retirement plans. This paragraph does not apply to either of the following:

(a) Contributions made by an eligible member as defined in paragraph 3 of this subsection, except that any service purchase by an eligible member is subject to any other limitations, including limitations on duplicative service purchase, otherwise provided in this article.

(b) Any member contributions with respect to which an irrevocable election has been made by a member pursuant to subsection B of this section, except that the service purchase is subject to any other limitations, including limitations on duplicative service purchase, otherwise provided in this article.

F. If a member's contributions are subject to the limitations of subsection E of this section, the contributions shall be treated as being made to a separate defined contribution plan.  If the member's contributions exceed the limits prescribed in subsection E of this section when taking into account other member and employer contributions to ASRS on behalf of the member for the limitation year, the amount to be paid by the member shall be reduced to not exceed the limits prescribed in subsection E of this section and the remaining amount shall be carried forward to the next limitation year, unless the limits are exceeded in the next limitation year. If the limits are exceeded in the next limitation year, the procedure prescribed by this subsection shall be repeated until all payments have been made.

2. Holding the amounts in a suspense account established pursuant to subsection L of this section and allocating the amounts as either member or employer contributions for the benefit of the member in the next limitation year and before any further member or employer contributions are made that would constitute annual additions made to a defined contribution plan pursuant to section 415 of the internal revenue code.  ASRS shall allocate contributions as prescribed in this section, and the amount allocated shall reduce the amount of the member or employer contributions for the limitation year in which the allocation is made.

H. To the extent that a payment under this subsection does not alter, amend or revoke any one or more currently effective irrevocable elections made by the member pursuant to subsection B or D of this section, the board may accept contributions made pursuant to section 38-771 or member contributions for the payment for credited service purchases pursuant to section 38-738, 38-742, 38-743, 38-744, 38-745 or 38-922 or contributions made pursuant to section 38-771.01, subsection F, paragraph 4, in whole or in part, by any one or a combination of the following methods:

If a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer is from a retirement program that is qualified under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code and that includes a cash or deferred arrangement described in section 401(k) of the internal revenue code, the member on whose behalf the transfer was made is not eligible to retire under section 38-764, subsection H before the date the member attains fifty-nine and one-half years of age.

3. Any member or employer contributions made to ASRS or any other plan that are treated as being made to a defined contribution plan maintained by an employer of the member.

4. Any forfeitures, including any income attributable to forfeitures, allocated for or on behalf of a member of ASRS or any other plan that are treated as being allocated under a defined contribution plan maintained by an employer of the member.

P. To the extent any portion of the subject benefits, if treated as subject to the benefit limitations of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code, exceed the applicable limitation on benefits pursuant to section 38-769 for the form of distribution, a percentage of corrective contributions and interest and gains shall be treated as annual additions for the limitation year in which contributed by the employer to ASRS. This percentage of corrective contributions and interest and gains shall be equal to the percentage determined by dividing the subject benefits that exceed the limitation on benefits pursuant to section 38-769 by the subject benefits.  If the corrective contributions and interest and gains that are treated as annual additions for the limitation year in which the corrective contributions and interest and gains are contributed by the employer to ASRS exceed the limit on annual additions for the limitation year, the retirement benefit attributable to the excess shall be treated as an excess benefit and shall be payable to the member as any other excess benefit is payable pursuant to section 38-774, and the employer shall pay the excess to the separate unfunded governmental excess benefit arrangement administered by the board pursuant to section 38-774.

1. The actuarial accrued liability shall equal the sum of the plan employer actuarial accrued liability and the LTD program employer actuarial accrued liability. Actuarial accrued liability shall be calculated based on the same actuarial assumptions and methods as the actuarial valuation performed immediately preceding the nonparticipating employer's nonparticipation date.

2. The designated asset amount shall equal the sum of the following:

2. The nonparticipating employer shall continue to make contributions through lump sum payments in accordance with section 38-735, equal to the sum of:

(a) Contributions owed through payroll deductions based on the contribution rate determined for participating employers pursuant to section 38-737.

(b) The amount required to amortize the past service funding requirement in the nonparticipating employer's separate fund over a period that is determined by the board and that is consistent with generally accepted actuarial standards.

F. The ASRS actuary shall determine the actuarial assumptions used to determine the contribution requirements for the nonparticipating employer under subsection E of this section. Notwithstanding section 38-737, the contribution for the nonparticipating employer may not be determined as a percentage of compensation due to the anticipated decline of compensation for employees of the nonparticipating employer participating in ASRS. The nonparticipating employer shall certify on each payroll the amount to be contributed and shall remit that amount to ASRS at a rate that is consistent with the rate paid by the participating employers.

At any time after benefits have commenced, the member may name a different contingent annuitant or rescind the election by written notice to the board as follows:

(a) If a different contingent annuitant is named, the life annuity of the member under the same joint and survivor life annuity option previously elected shall be adjusted to the actuarial equivalent of the original annuity, based on the age of the new contingent annuitant. The adjustment shall include all postretirement increases in retirement income that are authorized by law after the member's date of retirement. Payment of this adjusted life annuity shall continue under the provisions of the option previously elected by the member.

(b) If the member rescinds the election, the member shall thereafter receive a straight life annuity equal to what the member would otherwise be entitled to receive if the member had not elected the joint and survivor life annuity option, including all postretirement increases in retirement income that are authorized by law after the date of retirement. The increased payment shall continue during the remainder of the member's lifetime.

(c) If a member whose original date of retirement is before July 1, 2008 rescinds the joint and survivor life annuity option previously elected and receives the straight life annuity pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph, the member may again elect the same joint and survivor life annuity option previously elected subject to the same restrictions prescribed in subdivision (a) of this paragraph.

(d) A member whose original date of retirement is on or after July 1, 2008 may exercise a one-time election to rescind the joint and survivor life annuity option elected by the member if the contingent annuitant dies or ceases to be a contingent annuitant pursuant to the terms of a qualified domestic relations order.

(e) If the member's contingent annuitant is the member's current spouse, the member shall obtain the consent of the contingent annuitant pursuant to section 38-776 before the member names a new contingent annuitant or before the member rescinds the election, except that consent is not required if the rescission is pursuant to subdivision (d) of this paragraph.

2. A period certain and life annuity actuarially reduced with payments for five, ten or fifteen years that are not dependent on the continued lifetime of the member but whose payments continue for the member's lifetime beyond the five, ten or fifteen year period. At the time of electing this option, the member shall name a period certain beneficiary or beneficiaries who are entitled to receive the payments for any portion of the period certain beyond the lifetime of the member. The member may name a different beneficiary at any time. If no beneficiary survives the member, any remaining payments are the property of the member's estate. A member who retires after August 9, 2001 and before July 1, 2008 may rescind the election of a period certain and life annuity. If the member rescinds the election of a period certain and life annuity, the member shall thereafter receive a straight life annuity equal to what the member would otherwise be entitled to receive if the member had not elected the period certain and life annuity option, including all postretirement increases in retirement income that are authorized by law after the date of retirement. The increased payment shall continue during the remainder of the member's lifetime. If the member reverts to a straight life annuity pursuant to this paragraph, the member may again elect a period certain and life annuity subject to the same provisions of the period certain and life annuity previously elected by the member. If the member's contingent annuitant is the member's current spouse, the member shall obtain the consent of the contingent annuitant pursuant to section 38-776 before the member rescinds the election of a period certain and life annuity or again elects a period certain and life annuity. A member whose original date of retirement is on or after July 1, 2008 may exercise a one-time election to rescind the period certain and life annuity option elected by the member if the beneficiary dies or ceases to be a beneficiary pursuant to the terms of a qualified domestic relations order or at the expiration of the member's period certain term.

3. Beginning on July 1, 2002, a lump sum payment equal to not more than thirty-six months of the member's retirement benefits based on the actuarial equivalent of the retirement income to which the member would be entitled under normal or early retirement. The member's benefit shall be actuarially reduced to provide for the lump sum payment. The lump sum payment shall be made at the time of retirement. If a member has received an overpayment pursuant to section 38-765 or 38-797.08, ASRS shall withhold the overpayment amount plus any required income tax withholding from the partial lump sum. Any benefit increase granted to a member who elects a lump sum payment pursuant to this paragraph is subject to the following conditions:

(a) If the benefit increase is a percentage increase of the member's retirement benefit, the increase shall be based on the actuarially reduced retirement benefit of the member.

(b) If the benefit increase is pursuant to section 38-767, the amount of the member's benefit increase shall be calculated without regard to the lump sum payment pursuant to this paragraph.

4. Other forms of actuarially reduced optional benefits prescribed by the board.

C. A member who is married at the time of retirement shall elect a joint and survivor life annuity pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section, and the member's current spouse shall be the contingent annuitant unless the member's current spouse consents to a waiver of this requirement pursuant to section 38-776 or the election would violate another law, an existing contract or a court order. If the married member does not elect a type of joint and survivor life annuity for the member's current spouse and the member's current spouse has not waived the requirements of this subsection, ASRS shall cancel the member's retirement. The member may reapply for retirement at any time in a manner established by ASRS.

#### Section 38-762. Survivor benefits before retirement; definition

A. On the death of any active or inactive member before retirement, the designated beneficiary of the member shall be paid a survivor benefit equal to the sum of both of the following:

1. The member's contribution and interest and the employer's contribution and interest to the defined benefit plan established by this article for credited service that a member earned by working for an employer, plus all contributions and interest made for the purchase of military service, leave without pay or other public service credit. This amount excludes payments made by an employer pursuant to section 38-738, subsection B, paragraph 3, unless the member has made the payment required by section 38-738, subsection B, paragraph 1.

C. In lieu of a single payment, a designated beneficiary who is eligible for a survivor benefit pursuant to subsection A of this section may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of the survivor benefit as monthly income for life, if the resulting monthly amount is greater than or equal to the amount determined by the board under section 38-764, subsection E.

D. If a member dies before distribution of the member's benefits commences, the member's entire benefits shall be distributed within the required distribution provisions of section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section by the United States secretary of the treasury as prescribed in section 38-775.

E. If a deceased member did not designate a beneficiary or the beneficiary named by a member predeceases the member, ASRS shall pay the member's survivor benefit to the following persons in the following order of priority:

1. The member's surviving spouse.

2. The member's surviving natural or adopted children in equal shares.

3. The member's surviving parents in equal shares.

4. The member's estate.

F. Any payment pursuant to this section is payment for the account of the member or the member's beneficiary and all persons entitled to payment and, to the extent of the payment, is a full and complete discharge of all liability of the board or ASRS, or both, under or in connection with ASRS.

G. For the purposes of this section, "designated beneficiary" means any individual designated by the member as the member's beneficiary.

#### Section 38-763. Survivor benefits after retirement

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, if a member dies after distribution of retirement benefits commences, ASRS shall continue to distribute the remaining portion of retirement benefits within the required distribution provisions of section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section by the United States secretary of the treasury as prescribed in section 38-775.

B. On the death of a retired member who is receiving benefits, the estate or beneficiary of the member is entitled to receive at least the amount of the member's contribution to ASRS plus interest, as determined by the director, less the benefits distributed by ASRS. This amount is payable either as a lump sum or at the same periodic rate in effect at the time of the member's death, as determined by the estate or beneficiary.

#### Section 38-764. Commencement of retirement; payment of retirement benefits; lump sum payments

A. Retirement is deemed to commence on a date elected by the member.

D. The board may pay the entire retirement benefit in a lump sum pursuant to subsection C of this section only if continued membership in ASRS will result in additional requests for lump sum payments based on cost of living adjustments or the establishment of minimum benefit awards.

E. If any benefit that is payable as a series of periodic payments amounts to less than a threshold amount determined by the board, the board, in its sole discretion and based on uniform rules it establishes, may order the amount to be paid in a lump sum. A member who receives a lump sum payment pursuant to this subsection remains a member of ASRS and is eligible for the coverage provided pursuant to section 38-782 and the payment pursuant to section 38-783 but is not eligible for a benefit increase pursuant to section 38-767.

F. All distributions of retirement benefits to a member shall be distributed within the required distribution provisions of section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section by the United States secretary of the treasury as prescribed in section 38-775.

If any change or error in the records results in any member or beneficiary receiving from ASRS more or less than the member or beneficiary would have been entitled to receive if the records had been correct, ASRS shall correct the error and as far as practicable shall adjust the payments in a manner so that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member or beneficiary was correctly entitled is paid. ASRS shall correct any change or error and shall pay the appropriate monies to a member or beneficiary or shall recover monies from the member or beneficiary if the member or beneficiary is overpaid.  ASRS shall recover monies by reducing any benefit otherwise payable by ASRS or the LTD program established by article 2.1 of this chapter to an active, inactive, person with a disability or retired member, survivor, contingent annuitant, beneficiary or alternate payee.

 

#### Section 38-766. Retired members; return to work; suspension of benefits; exceptions; maximum benefit

D. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, ASRS shall not suspend the payment of retirement benefits if a retired member begins or returns to employment with an employer in a position that satisfies all of the following:

1. Results in a true change in position, job duties and job title from the position occupied by the member before ASRS retirement.

2. Either:

#### Section 38-766.02. Retired members; return to work; employer contribution payments; exception; definitions

A. Notwithstanding section 38-766.01, subsection E, beginning July 1, 2012, an employer shall pay contributions at an alternate contribution rate on behalf of a retired member who returns to work with an ASRS employer in any capacity in a position ordinarily filled by an employee of the employer or in a position that is similar in duties and responsibilities to that of a position ordinarily filled by an employee of the employer. This subsection applies to a retired member who has reached a normal retirement age or a retired member who retired under section 38-758 if the retired member's retirement benefit has not been suspended pursuant to section 38-766.

B. The ASRS actuary shall determine the alternate contribution rate in an annual valuation performed as of June 30. For the fiscal year beginning on July 1 of the following calendar year, the valuation shall determine the percentage to be applied to the compensation, gross salary or contract fee of a retired member who meets the requirements of this section.

C. The alternate contribution rate shall not be less than two percent in any fiscal year. The alternate contribution rate is equal to the lesser of:

1. The employer contribution rate established by the ASRS actuary pursuant to section 38-737 plus the employer contribution rate established by the ASRS actuary pursuant to section 38-797.06.

2. The total past service funding requirement rate established by the ASRS actuary pursuant to section 38-737 plus the total past service funding requirement rate established by the ASRS actuary pursuant to section 38-797.06.

D. ASRS shall determine the schedule and method of payment of the alternate contribution rate.  Subject to section 38-738, subsection A, all contributions made by the employer and allocated to the fund established by section 38-712 are irrevocable and shall be used as benefits under this article or to pay the expenses of ASRS. Payments made pursuant to this section by employers become delinquent after the due date prescribed in the board's rules and thereafter shall be increased by interest from and after that date until payment is received by ASRS. ASRS shall charge interest on the delinquent payments as prescribed in section 38-711. ASRS may recover delinquent payments due under this section, together with interest charges as provided in this section, by action in a court of competent jurisdiction against an employer liable for payments or, at the request of the director, ASRS may deduct the delinquent payments and interest charges from any other monies, including excise revenue taxes, payable to the employer by any department or agency of this state.

E. An employer of a retired member shall submit any reports, data, paperwork or materials that are requested by ASRS and that are necessary to determine the compensation, gross salary or contract fee associated with a retired member who returns to work or to determine the function, utilization, efficacy or operation of the return to work program.

F. An employer is not required to pay contributions at an alternate contribution rate on behalf of a retired member under subsection A of this section if the retired member returns to work with the employer in a position that is currently filled by an employee of the employer who is an active member and for which the employer is currently required to pay and is paying contributions on behalf of the active member in that same position pursuant to sections 38-736 and 38-737.  An employer may pay contributions at an alternate contribution rate for a retired member who meets the requirements for an exemption under this subsection.

G. For contributions made pursuant to subsection F of this section beginning July 1, 2019, if ASRS and the employer determine that the alternate contribution rate does not apply to a retired member who returns to work for whom the employer has paid contributions at the alternate contribution rate, the employer may request an employer credit, not including interest, for those contributions within ninety days after the end of the fiscal year in which the contributions were paid.  If ASRS determines that an employer credit is not feasible, ASRS shall issue a refund to an employer in a form determined by ASRS.

H. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Contract fee" means the gross amount paid to a retired member as an independent contractor minus an amount, not to exceed ten percent, for an administrative fee.

2. "Gross salary" means the gross amount paid to a retired member by a leasing company as salary or wages, including amounts that are subject to deferred compensation or tax shelter agreements, for services rendered or that would have been paid to the retired member except for the member's election or a legal requirement that all or part of the gross amount be used for other purposes.

#### Section 38-767. Benefit increases; applicability

A. For a member whose membership commenced before the effective date of this amendment to this section, effective July 1 of each year, each retired member or beneficiary of a retired member is entitled to receive a permanent benefit increase in the base benefit equal to the amount determined in subsection D of this section if the retired member or beneficiary of a retired member was receiving benefits on or before July 31 of the previous calendar year. The annual permanent benefit increases shall be paid on a monthly basis. The benefit increase shall commence on July 1.

B. The total amount of the percentage increase provided in subsection A of this section shall not exceed four per cent in aggregate for all persons eligible for an increase.  The percentage payable from excess investment earnings shall be determined as follows:

1. Determine any excess investment earnings account balance available.

2. Determine the total excess investment earnings as provided in subsection C of this section.

3. Add the amount determined in paragraph 1 of this subsection to the amount determined in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

4. Determine one per cent of the actuarial present value of benefits for retired members and beneficiaries as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which an increase is being granted.

5. Divide the amount determined in paragraph 3 of this subsection by the amount determined in paragraph 4 of this subsection.  If the quotient is equal to or more than four, the percentage increase payable from excess investment earnings on accounts associated with those persons eligible for an annual benefit increase pursuant to subsection A of this section is four per cent. If the quotient is one or more but less than four, the percentage increase payable from excess investment earnings on accounts associated with those persons eligible for an annual benefit increase pursuant to subsection A of this section is that per cent rounded to the nearest tenth of a per cent. If the quotient is less than one, no benefit increases shall be granted.

C. The excess investment earnings on accounts associated with those persons eligible for an annual benefit increase pursuant to subsection A of this section are equal to the actuarial present value of benefits for all retired members and beneficiaries as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which an increase is being granted multiplied by the positive difference, if any, between the yield rate on the actuarial value of ASRS assets for the fiscal year that ended June 30 of the year prior to the year for which an increase is being granted and eight per cent.  The excess investment earnings on accounts associated with those persons eligible for an annual benefit increase pursuant to subsection A of this section are zero if the yield rate on ASRS assets is less than or equal to eight per cent.

D. The permanent benefit increase for each person entitled to receive an increase pursuant to subsection A of this section shall be determined based on years of credited service as follows:

1. Multiply the percentage determined in subsection B, paragraph 5 of this section by the actuarial present value of benefits for retired members and beneficiaries as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which an increase is being granted.

2. Determine the actuarial present value of a one dollar per year of credited service annual increase in the base benefit amounts as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which an increase is being granted, received by all persons entitled to receive an increase pursuant to subsection A of this section.

3. Divide the amount determined in paragraph 1 of this subsection by the amount determined in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

4. Multiply the amount determined in paragraph 3 of this subsection by the number of years of credited service for each retired member and the number of years of credited service earned by a retired member for each beneficiary entitled to receive an increase pursuant to subsection A of this section.

E. Any excess investment earnings on accounts associated with those persons eligible for an annual benefit increase pursuant to subsection A of this section from any year that are not used for benefit adjustments for that year are available for future benefit increases in the following years.

F. Monies available for future benefit increases shall earn interest at a rate of eight per cent per year.  This interest shall be used to pay the additional benefit increases provided for in subsection G of this section.

G. In addition to a benefit increase pursuant to subsection A of this section, if a retired member who was eligible for an annual benefit increase pursuant to subsection A of this section had more than ten years of credited service, the retired member or beneficiary of the retired member is entitled to receive a benefit increase based on the number of years following retirement as follows:

1. At least five years but less than ten years, a monthly benefit increase equal to the amount determined in subsection H of this section.

2. At least ten years but less than fifteen years, a monthly benefit increase equal to two times the amount determined in subsection H of this section.

3. At least fifteen years but less than twenty years, a monthly benefit increase equal to three times the amount determined in subsection H of this section.

4. At least twenty years but less than twenty-five years, a monthly benefit increase equal to four times the amount determined in subsection H of this section.

5. At least twenty-five years but less than thirty years, a monthly benefit increase equal to five times the amount determined in subsection H of this section.

6. At least thirty years, a monthly benefit increase equal to six times the amount determined in subsection H of this section.

H. The amount of the monthly benefit increase under subsection G of this section for a retired member or beneficiary of a retired member who is entitled to the increase when at least five years but less than ten years have elapsed since the retired member's retirement date is equal to the amount obtained by dividing the amount of interest credited pursuant to subsection F of this section by the amount that equals the sum of:

1. The actuarial present value, as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which the increase is granted, of a benefit increase of one dollar per month for the retired members and beneficiaries of retired members who are eligible for an increase under subsection G of this section and for whom at least five years but less than ten years have elapsed since the retired members' retirement dates.

2. The actuarial present value, as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which the increase is granted, of a benefit increase of two dollars per month for the retired members and beneficiaries of retired members who are eligible for an increase under subsection G of this section and for whom at least ten years but less than fifteen years have elapsed since the retired members' retirement dates.

3. The actuarial present value, as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which the increase is granted, of a benefit increase of three dollars per month for the retired members and beneficiaries of retired members who are eligible for an increase under subsection G of this section and for whom at least fifteen years but less than twenty years have elapsed since the retired members' retirement dates.

4. The actuarial present value, as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which the increase is granted, of a benefit increase of four dollars per month for the retired members and beneficiaries of retired members who are eligible for an increase under subsection G of this section and for whom at least twenty years but less than twenty-five years have elapsed since the retired members' retirement dates.

5. The actuarial present value, as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which the increase is granted, of a benefit increase of five dollars per month for the retired members and beneficiaries of retired members who are eligible for an increase under subsection G of this section and for whom at least twenty-five years but less than thirty years have elapsed since the retired members' retirement dates.

6. The actuarial present value, as of June 30 of the year prior to the year for which the increase is granted, of a benefit increase of six dollars per month for the retired members and beneficiaries of retired members who are eligible for an increase under subsection G of this section and for whom at least thirty years have elapsed since the retired members' retirement dates.

I. A member of the defined contribution program administered by ASRS is only eligible for the benefit increases pursuant to this section if the member elects to transfer irrevocably from the defined contribution program administered by ASRS to the defined benefit program established by this article.

J. The cost of the benefit increases granted pursuant to this section shall be added to the existing liabilities of ASRS.

K. As used in this section, the actuarial present value of benefits for retired members and beneficiaries does not include the value of benefits provided pursuant to section 38-783.

 

#### Section 38-768. Minimum retirement benefit

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a retired member or beneficiary who is entitled to a benefit under this article shall receive at least a minimum monthly benefit that is computed pursuant to subsection B of this section if the retired member or beneficiary is at least seventy-five years of age and if the retired member or beneficiary is any of the following:

1. Retired from ASRS with at least twenty years of credited service.

2. A beneficiary of ASRS who is receiving benefits derived from a retired member who had at least twenty years of credited service.

4. A beneficiary who is receiving benefits derived from a retired member who had at least twenty years of service, who irrevocably revoked the receipt of benefits determined on the basis of membership in the defined contribution program administered by ASRS and who elected to receive benefits under this article.

B. The minimum monthly benefit provided by subsection A of this section:

1. For retired members, is $600.

2. For beneficiaries, is the amount determined by paragraph 1 of this subsection and reduced in accordance with the option chosen by multiplying the amount determined by paragraph 1 of this subsection by the actuarial figure for the option chosen and by the percentage of the option chosen.

C. If the minimum monthly benefit pursuant to subsections A and B of this section is more than the retired member's or beneficiary's current monthly benefit, the retired member or beneficiary is eligible to receive a monthly benefit equal to the minimum benefit. If the retired member's or beneficiary's current monthly benefit is more than the minimum benefit, the retired member's or beneficiary's benefit remains the same.

D. A member who receives a lump sum payment pursuant to section 38-764, subsection C is not eligible for a minimum benefit as provided by this section.

#### Section 38-769. Maximum retirement benefits; termination; definitions

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, except as provided in subsection C of this section, the employer provided portion of a member's annual benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity, at any time within a limitation year, shall not exceed one hundred sixty thousand dollars or a larger amount that is effective as of January 1 of each calendar year, is prescribed by the board and is due to any cost of living adjustment announced by the United States secretary of the treasury pursuant to section 415(d) of the internal revenue code. The board shall increase the amount pursuant to this subsection as of the effective date of the increase as prescribed by the United States secretary of the treasury. Benefit increases provided in this section resulting from the increase in the limitations of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code as amended by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001 shall be provided to all current and former members who have benefits that are limited by section 415(b) of the internal revenue code and who have an accrued benefit under ASRS immediately before July 1, 2001, other than an accrued benefit resulting from a benefit increase solely as a result of the increases provided by this section resulting from the increase in the limitations of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code as amended by the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of 2001.

B. Notwithstanding the limitations of subsection A of this section, the benefits payable to a member are deemed not to exceed the limitations determined under subsection A of this section if the retirement benefits payable to the member under this article do not exceed ten thousand dollars for the limitation year and if an employer has not at any time maintained a defined contribution plan in which the member has participated.

C. The limitations determined under subsection A of this section are subject to the following adjustments:

1. If a member has less than ten years of membership in ASRS, the maximum dollar limitation determined under subsection A of this section shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of years, or partial years, of membership in ASRS and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided in this paragraph also applies to the ten thousand dollar floor limitation provided in subsection B of this section, except that the reduction applies to years of service with an employer rather than to years of membership in ASRS. The reduction in this paragraph does not reduce the limitations determined under subsection A of this section to an amount less than one-tenth of the limitations as determined without regard to this paragraph.

2. If the member's benefit under ASRS commences before the member reaches sixty-two years of age, the benefit will be limited to:

(a) If the annuity starting date is in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code as adjusted in subsection A of this section, with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount:

(i) The interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified by the board for determining actuarial equivalence for early retirement purposes.

(ii) A five per cent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table.

(b) If the annuity starting date is in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007 and ASRS does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two and the age of benefit commencement, the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code as adjusted in subsection A of this section, with actuarial equivalence computed using a five per cent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity start date.

(c) If the annuity starting date is in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007 and ASRS has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-two and the age of benefit commencement, the lesser of:

(i) The adjusted dollar limitation determined in accordance with subdivision (b) of this paragraph, determined without applying the limitations of section 415 of the internal revenue code.

(ii) The product of the dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code as adjusted in subsection A of this section, multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under ASRS at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under ASRS at age sixty-two, determined without applying the limitations of section 415 of the internal revenue code.

3. If the retirement benefit under ASRS commences after the member reaches sixty-five years of age, the dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code as adjusted in subsection A of this section on that benefit is increased to:

(a) If the annuity starting date is in a limitation year beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A) as adjusted under section 415(d) of the internal revenue code, with actuarial equivalence computed using whichever of the following produces the smaller annual amount:

(i) The interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified by the board for determining actuarial equivalence for delayed retirement purposes.

(ii) A five per cent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table.

(b) If the annuity starting date is in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007 and ASRS does not have an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five and the age of benefit commencement, the annual amount of a benefit payable in the form of a straight life annuity commencing at the member's annuity starting date that is the actuarial equivalent of the dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code as adjusted in subsection A of this section, with actuarial equivalence computed using a five per cent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table and expressing the member's age based on completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date.

(c) If the annuity starting date is in a limitation year beginning on or after July 1, 2007 and ASRS has an immediately commencing straight life annuity payable at both age sixty-five and the age of benefit commencement, the lesser of:

(i) The adjusted dollar limitation determined in accordance with subdivision (b) of this paragraph, determined without applying the limitations of section 415 of the internal revenue code.

(ii) The product of the dollar limitation under section 415(b)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code as adjusted in subsection A of this section, multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under ASRS at the member's annuity starting date to the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life annuity under ASRS at age sixty-five, determined without applying the limitations of section 415 of the internal revenue code.

4. For purposes of applying the limits of section 415 of the internal revenue code, a retirement benefit that is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity and that is not subject to section 417(e)(3) of the internal revenue code must be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that equals either:

(a) For limitation years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, the greater of the annual amount of the straight life annuity, if any, payable under ASRS at the same annuity starting date, and the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit computed using an interest rate of five per cent and the applicable mortality table under section 417(e)(3) of the internal revenue code.

(b) For limitation years beginning before July 1, 2007, the annual amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit computed using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount:

(i) The interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified by the board for adjusting benefits in the same form.

(ii) A five per cent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table.

5. For the purpose of applying the limits of section 415 of the internal revenue code, a retirement benefit that is payable in any form other than a straight life annuity to which section 417(e)(3) of the internal revenue code would apply if that section of the internal revenue code were applicable to ASRS must be adjusted to an actuarially equivalent straight life annuity that equals:

(a) If the annuity starting date is in a plan year beginning on or after July 1, 2006, the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount:

(i) The interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified by the board for adjusting benefits in the same form.

(ii) A five and one-half per cent interest rate assumption and the applicable mortality table.

(iii) The applicable interest rate under section 417(e)(3) of the internal revenue code and the applicable mortality table, divided by 1.05. The stability period during which the applicable interest rate remains constant is the plan year.  The look-back month that is used to determine the applicable interest rate during the stability period is the third full calendar month preceding the first day of the stability period.  For the purposes of this item, "applicable interest rate" means the annual interest rate on thirty-year treasury securities as specified by the commissioner of the United States internal revenue service for a month in revenue rulings or notices or another guidance published by the commissioner in the internal revenue bulletin.

(b) If the annuity starting date is in a plan year beginning in July 1, 2004 or July 1, 2005, the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit payable, using whichever of the following produces the greater annual amount:

(i) The interest rate and mortality table or other tabular factor specified by the board for adjusting benefits in the same form.

(ii) A five and one-half per cent interest assumption and the applicable mortality table.

(c) If the annuity starting date is on or after July 1, 2004 and before December 31, 2004, and ASRS applies the transition rule in section 101(d)(3) of the pension funding equity act of 2005 in lieu of the rule in subdivision (b) of this paragraph, the annual amount of the straight life annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same actuarial present value as the member's form of benefit, determined in accordance with internal revenue service notice 2004-78.

6. When calculating the limitations of paragraph 4 or 5 of this subsection, the portion of any joint or survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity as defined in section 417 of the internal revenue code shall be disregarded.

D. Subsection C, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section do not apply to income received from ASRS as a pension, annuity or similar allowance as a result of the recipient developing a disability by personal injury or sickness or to amounts received from ASRS by beneficiaries, survivors or the estate of a member as a result of the death of the member.

E. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the annual benefit payable under this article may be reduced to the extent necessary, as determined by the board, to prevent disqualification of ASRS under section 415 of the internal revenue code that imposes additional limitations on the annual benefits payable to members who also may be participating in another tax qualified pension or savings plan of this state. An employer shall not provide employee retirement or deferred benefits if the benefits authorized by this section and as required by federal law result in the failure of ASRS to meet federal qualification standards as applied to public pension plans.  The board shall advise affected members of any additional information concerning their annual benefits required by this subsection.  All benefits payable pursuant to this subsection shall comply with the limitations of benefits contained in section 415 of the internal revenue code and the final treasury regulations issued under that section. Notwithstanding any provision of this article to the contrary, if the annual benefits within the meaning of section 415 of the internal revenue code for any member exceed the limits of section 415(b) of the internal revenue code and this section, ASRS may only correct the excess pursuant to the employee plans compliance resolution system prescribed in internal revenue service revenue procedure 2008-50 or any future guidance by the internal revenue service, including the preamble of the final treasury regulations issued under section 415 of the internal revenue code.

F. If the maximum amount of benefit allowed under section 415 of the internal revenue code is increased after the commencement date of a member's benefit due to any cost of living adjustment announced by the United States secretary of the treasury pursuant to the provisions of section 415(d) of the internal revenue code, the amount of the monthly benefit payable under ASRS to a member whose benefit is restricted due to the provisions of section 415(d) of the internal revenue code shall be increased by the board as of the date prescribed by the United States secretary of the treasury on which the increase shall become effective. The increase shall reflect the increase in the amount of retirement income that may be payable under this article as a result of the cost of living adjustment.

G. In determining the adjustments to the defined benefit dollar limitation authorized by subsection A of this section, the board shall prescribe a larger defined benefit dollar limitation if prescribed by the United States secretary of the treasury pursuant to section 415(d) of the internal revenue code. An adjustment to the defined benefit dollar limitation prescribed in subsection A of this section is not effective before the first calendar year for which the United States secretary of the treasury publishes the adjustment. After it is prescribed by the board, the new defined benefit dollar limitation applies to the limitation year ending with or within the calendar year for which the secretary of the treasury makes the adjustment.

H. For the purposes of the limitations prescribed by this section, all member and employer contributions made to ASRS to provide a member benefits pursuant to section 38-771 or 38-771.01 and all member contributions that are not treated as picked up by the employer under section 414(h)(2) of the internal revenue code shall be treated as made to a separate defined contribution plan.

I. On termination or partial termination of ASRS, the accrued benefit of each member is, as of the date of termination or partial termination, fully vested and nonforfeitable to the extent then funded.

J. If ASRS terminates, the benefit of any highly compensated employee as defined in section 414(q) of the internal revenue code and any highly compensated former employee is limited to a benefit that is nondiscriminatory under section 401(a)(4) of the internal revenue code and as follows:

1. Benefits distributed to any of the twenty-five active and former highly compensated employees with the greatest compensation in the current or any prior fiscal year are restricted so that the annual payments are no greater than an amount equal to the payment that would be made on behalf of the member under a straight life annuity that is the actuarial equivalent of the sum of the member's accrued benefit, the member's other benefits under ASRS, excluding a social security supplement as defined in 26 Code of Federal Regulations 411(a)-7(C)(4)(ii), and the amount the member is entitled to receive under a social security supplement.

2. Paragraph 1 of this subsection does not apply if either:

(a) After payment of the benefit to a member described in paragraph 1 of this subsection, the value of ASRS assets equals or exceeds one hundred ten per cent of the value of the current liabilities, as defined in section 412(l)(7) of the internal revenue code, of ASRS.

(b) The value of the benefits for a member described in paragraph 1 of this subsection is less than one per cent of the value of the current liabilities, as defined in section 412(l)(7) of the internal revenue code, of ASRS before distribution.

(c) The value of the benefits payable by ASRS to a member described in paragraph 1 of this subsection does not exceed three thousand five hundred dollars.

K. For the purposes of subsection J of this section, "benefit" includes loans in excess of the amount prescribed in section 72(p)(2)(A) of the internal revenue code, any periodic income, any withdrawal values payable to a living member and any death benefits not provided for by insurance on the member's life.

L. On retirement of a member who was a retired member, who resumed active membership and who subsequently retires, the limitations of this section in effect on the member's subsequent retirement apply to the member's retirement benefit payable as recomputed pursuant to section 38-766. In addition, the sum of the present value of the member's recomputed retirement benefits plus the present value of the benefits the member received during the member's prior retirement shall not exceed the present value of the limitations in effect on the member's subsequent retirement. The limitations prescribed in this subsection shall not reduce a member's retirement benefit below the retirement benefit the member was receiving before the member resumed active membership. For the purposes of determining present value under this subsection, the board shall use the actuarial equivalent assumptions provided in section 38-711, paragraph 2.

M. For the purposes of this section:

1. The following adjustments shall be made to the definition of compensation prescribed in subsection O of this section:

(a) Compensation shall be adjusted for the types of compensation that are prescribed in this paragraph and that are paid after a member's severance from employment with an employer.  Amounts described in subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) of this paragraph may be included only as compensation to the extent the amounts are paid by the later of two and one-half months after severance from employment or by the end of the limitation year that includes the date of the severance from employment.  Any other payment of compensation paid after severance of employment that is not described in the types of compensation prescribed in this paragraph is not considered compensation for purposes of this section, even if payment is made within the time period prescribed in this subdivision.

(b) Compensation shall include regular pay after severance of employment if the payment is regular compensation for services performed during the member's regular working hours or compensation for services performed outside the member's regular working hours, such as overtime or shift differential, commission, bonus or other similar payments, and the payment would have been paid to the member before a severance from employment if the member had continued in employment with the employer.

(c) Leave cash-outs shall be included in compensation if those amounts would have been included in compensation if they were paid before the member's severance from employment and the amounts are payment for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave, but only if the member would have been able to use the leave if employment had continued.

(d) Deferred compensation shall be included in compensation if the compensation would have been included in compensation if it had been paid before the member's severance from employment and the compensation is received pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan, but only if the payment would have been paid at the same time if the member had continued in employment with the employer and only to the extent that the payment is includable in the member's gross income.

(e) Compensation does include payments to an individual who does not currently perform services for an employer by reason of qualified military service as defined in section 414(u)(5) of the internal revenue code to the extent those payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for the employer rather than entering qualified military service.

(f) Compensation does not include compensation paid to a member who is a person with a permanent and total disability as defined in section 22(e)(3) of the internal revenue code.

(g) Compensation shall include amounts that are includable in the gross income of a member as required by section 409A or section 457(f)(1)(A) of the internal revenue code or because the amounts are constructively received by the member.

2. Compensation for a limitation year shall not include amounts earned but not paid during the limitation year solely because of the timing of pay periods and pay dates.

3. Payments awarded by an administrative agency or court or pursuant to a bona fide agreement by an employer to compensate a member for lost wages are compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates, but only to the extent the payments represent wages and compensation that would otherwise be included in compensation under this section.

N. The definition of limitation year prescribed in subsection O of this section may only be changed by an amendment to subsection O, except that if ASRS is terminated effective as of a date other than the last day of the limitation year, the termination shall be treated as if this section has been amended to change the definition of limitation year.

O. For the purposes of this section:

1. Annual additions shall be determined as provided in section 38-747, subsection O.

2. "Annual benefit" means a benefit, including any portion of a member's retirement benefit payable to an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order that satisfies the requirements prescribed in section 414(p)(1)(A)(i) of the internal revenue code and section 38-773, payable annually in the form of a straight life annuity, disregarding the portion of a joint and survivor annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity as defined in section 417 of the internal revenue code, with no ancillary or incidental benefits or rollover contributions and excluding any portion of the benefit derived from member contributions or other contributions that are treated as a separate defined contribution plan under section 415 of the internal revenue code but including any of those contributions that are picked up by the employer under section 414(h) of the internal revenue code, or that otherwise are not treated as a separate defined contribution plan. If the benefit is payable in another form, the determination as to whether the limitation described in subsection A of this section has been satisfied shall be made by the board by adjusting the benefit so that it is actuarially equivalent to the annual benefit described in this paragraph in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the United States secretary of the treasury. In addition, for determining the annual benefit attributable to member contributions, the factors described in section 411(c)(2)(B) of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code shall be used by the board regardless of whether section 411 of the internal revenue code applies to ASRS.  The factors described in section 411(c)(2)(B) of the internal revenue code shall be those factors described under section 417(e)(3) of the internal revenue code and determined on the basis of the 417(e) mortality table and an interest rate as prescribed in subsection C, paragraph 5 of this section.

3. "Applicable mortality table" means the mortality table described in internal revenue service revenue ruling 2001-62.

4. "Compensation" means the member's earned income, wages, salaries, fees for professional service and other amounts received for personal services actually rendered in the course of employment with the employer and includes amounts described in sections 104(a)(3) and 105(a) of the internal revenue code, but only to the extent that these amounts are includable in the gross income of the member.  Compensation also includes any elective deferral as defined in section 402(g)(3) of the internal revenue code and any amount that is contributed or deferred by an employer at the election of a member and that is not includable in the gross income of the member by reason of section 125, 132(f)(4) or 457 of the internal revenue code.  Compensation does not mean:

(a) Employer contributions to a plan of deferred compensation to the extent the contributions are not included in the gross income of the employee for the taxable year in which contributed and any distributions from a plan of deferred compensation, regardless of whether the amounts are includable in gross income of the employee when distributed, except that any amount received by a member pursuant to an unfunded nonqualified plan may be considered as compensation for the purposes of this section in the year the amounts are includable in the gross income of the member under the internal revenue code.

(b) Other amounts that receive special tax benefits, such as premiums for group term life insurance, but only to the extent that the premiums are not includable in the gross income of the employee, qualified transportation fringe benefits as defined in section 132 of the internal revenue code and, effective for plan years beginning from and after December 31, 1987, any amounts under section 125 of the internal revenue code that are not available to a member in cash in lieu of group health coverage because the member is unable to certify that the member has other health coverage.

5. "Defined benefit dollar limitation" means the dollar limitation determined under subsection A of this section.

6. "Defined benefit plan" has the same meaning prescribed in section 414(j) of the internal revenue code.

7. "Defined contribution plan" has the same meaning prescribed in section 414(i) of the internal revenue code.

8. "Limitation year" and "years of service" mean the fiscal year.

#### Section 38-770. Eligible rollover distribution; definitions

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article that would limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at any time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.

B. An eligible rollover distribution may commence less than thirty days after the notice required under section 402(f) of the internal revenue code is given to the distributee, provided that both:

1. ASRS clearly informs the distributee that the distributee has a right to a period of at least thirty days after receiving the notice to consider the decision of whether or not to elect a direct rollover.

2. The distributee, after receiving the notice, affirmatively elects a distribution.

C. In addition to the other elections allowed in this section, effective for distributions made from and after December 31, 2006, a designated beneficiary of a member who is not the member's surviving spouse may elect, at any time and in the manner prescribed by ASRS, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan described in subsection D, paragraph 3, subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section.  For the purposes of this subsection, "designated beneficiary" has the same meaning prescribed in section 38-775.

D. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Direct rollover" means a payment by ASRS to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.

2. "Distributee" means a member, a member's surviving spouse or a member's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under an acceptable domestic relations order as defined in section 38-773.

3. "Eligible retirement plan" means any of the following that accepts a distributee's eligible rollover distribution:

(a) An individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the internal revenue code.

(b) An individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the internal revenue code.

(c) An annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the internal revenue code.

(d) A qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the internal revenue code.

(e) An annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the internal revenue code.

(g) Beginning January 1, 2008, a Roth individual retirement account described in section 408A of the internal revenue code.

(h) For distributions made after December 18, 2015, a simple retirement account that satisfies the requirements of section 408(p) of the internal revenue code.

4. "Eligible rollover distribution" means distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee but does not include any of the following:

(a) Any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments made not less frequently than annually for the life or life expectancy of the member or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the member and the member's designated beneficiary or for a specified period of ten years or more.

(b) Any distribution to the extent the distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code.

(c) Except as provided in this paragraph, the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income.  A distribution does not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions that are not includable in gross income if the portion is paid only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or 408(b) of the internal revenue code, to a qualified plan described in section 401(a) of the internal revenue code or an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the internal revenue code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, and earnings on those amounts, including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includable in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not includable in gross income.

(d) Any distribution that is made due to hardship of the member.

#### Section 38-771. Benefit options for transferred defined contribution program members; definitions

A. On or before December 31, 1995 a nonretired ASRS member who was a member of the defined contribution program administered by ASRS and who was transferred to the defined benefit program established by this article on July 1, 1981 shall elect to receive either retirement benefits provided under this section or retirement benefits as otherwise provided by this article. An election under this subsection is irrevocable. A member who fails to make an election under this subsection is deemed to have elected to receive retirement benefits provided under this section.

B. A member who elects to receive retirement benefits provided under this section is eligible only for those benefits.

C. If a member elects to receive retirement benefits provided under this section, the member shall elect to receive retirement benefits based on either of the following:

1. The contributions paid by the member and member's employer, plus all earnings attributed to the member's retirement account, through the member's retirement date.

2. Except as provided in subsections E and F of this section, contributions paid by the member and member's employer at the contribution rate in effect before July 1, 1975 and an employee and employer contribution rate of seven per cent calculated from July 1, 1975, plus all earnings attributed to the member's retirement account, through the member's retirement date.

D. Notwithstanding sections 38-736 and 38-737, members who elect to receive retirement benefits provided under this section and their employers shall each make contributions at a rate of seven per cent of the member's compensation and, beginning on July 1, 1998, employers shall make contributions to ASRS on behalf of their respective members who have elected to receive retirement benefits provided under this section to pay the actuarially determined amount necessary to provide the group health and accident insurance benefits for those retired members and their dependents as provided under section 38-783. Member contributions pursuant to this subsection shall be salary reduction contributions pursuant to section 38-747, subsections C and D.

E. Subject to subsection F of this section, if a member desires to receive retirement benefits based on subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section, the member shall make the election on or before June 30, 1999 and during the member's active employment. The election shall be made in accordance with section 38-747, subsections C, D and H. If a member elects to receive retirement benefits based on subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section, both the member and the member's employer shall pay to ASRS the difference between the contributions made and seven per cent of the member's gross compensation from July 1, 1984 through December 31, 1995. If a member elects to have the member's employer make payments for all or a portion of the contributions pursuant to section 38-747, subsection D, the member's employer shall make the contributions as required by section 38-747, subsection D. If a member elects to make contributions pursuant to section 38-747, subsection H, both the member and the member's employer shall pay to ASRS the portion of the difference between the total required contributions and that portion of the required contributions that the member has elected to have the member's employer pay pursuant to section 38-747, subsection D. The member's employer shall make the employer's contributions attributable to a member's period of employment before July 1, 1999 in a single lump sum payment at the time and computed in the manner prescribed in section 38-771.01, subsections G and H. If a member elects pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section to have contributions made or to make contributions pursuant to section 38-747, subsection D or H for less than the full amount permitted by this subsection the member's benefits shall be computed only with reference to the contributions actually made. A member shall make an election pursuant to this section with respect to contributions to be made by the member before July 1, 1999. This election shall remain in full force and effect on and after July 1, 1999 and may be modified or revoked by the member only if the modification or revocation is specifically authorized in section 38-747. Section 38-771.01 governs any elections made by a member with respect to contributions to be made by the member to ASRS on or after July 1, 1999.

F. Contributions made to ASRS by a member and the member's employer pursuant to subsections D and E of this section shall not exceed, in any one limitation year, the limits of section 38-747, subsection E. If for any reason, the member and employer contributions to ASRS made pursuant to subsections D and E of this section would, at the time such contributions are due, taking into account other employer and member contributions due to ASRS for the limitation year, exceed the limits of section 38-747, the amount to be paid by the member and the member's employer under subsection E of this section shall be proportionately reduced and such reduction shall be carried into the succeeding limitation year and paid by the member and the member's employer within thirty days of the beginning of such limitation year, unless the limits of section 38-747 would again be exceeded, in which event this procedure will be repeated until all such contributions have been made. If more than one employer is contributing on behalf of a member, the reduction and contributions in succeeding years shall be proportionately allocated among the employers. If a member retires prior to making all contributions under subsections D and E of this section because of the limitations of section 38-747, the member's benefits under this section shall be calculated only with reference to the contributions actually made. For purposes of this subsection, "limitation year" has the same meaning prescribed in section 38-769.

G. A member who elects to receive retirement benefits provided under this section is subject to the provisions of section 38-771.01, subsection K that are equivalent to those imposed before the member's transfer from the defined contribution program administered by ASRS to the defined benefit program established by this article.

H.

2. Even if the beneficiary satisfies the requirements of paragraph 1 of this subsection, a beneficiary is not entitled to receive benefits under this section if the beneficiary is a beneficiary of a deceased retired member who elected a form of benefit under either the defined benefit program established by this article or the defined contribution program administered by ASRS that did not provide for survivor benefits after the death of the retired member.

C. A member or a deceased member's beneficiary who receives benefits pursuant to this section shall receive benefits based on the sum of the following:

1. Contributions paid by the member and the member's employer at the contribution rates in effect before July 1, 1984, together with all applicable earnings and supplemental credits on those contributions.

Contributions paid by the member's employer at the contribution rates in effect beginning on July 1, 1984 through the earlier of June 30, 1999 or the member's retirement or death, together with all applicable earnings and supplemental credits on those contributions computed through the earlier of June 30, 1999 or the member's retirement or death.

3.

After this recomputation, adjustment and payment, ASRS shall credit and charge these retirement account reserves with the amounts prescribed under the defined contribution program administered by ASRS based on the adjustments prescribed in this section.

E. Effective on July 1, 1999, ASRS shall adjust each nonretired member's accounts under the defined contribution program administered by ASRS to equal the sum of the contribution amounts prescribed in subsection C, paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section with respect to periods of a member's employment before July 1, 1999. After the adjustment, these accounts shall accrue applicable interest and supplemental credits based on the entire amounts credited to the accounts.

F. For periods of a nonretired member's employment on or after July 1, 1999, a nonretired member who is entitled to receive benefits pursuant to this section and the nonretired member's employer shall each make contributions to ASRS at the rates established pursuant to sections 38-736 and 38-737, except as follows:

1. If a nonretired member made an election pursuant to section 38-771, subsection C, paragraph 2 and section 38-747, subsections C and D before July 1, 1999, the member's employer shall continue to make pickup contributions to ASRS on behalf of the member pursuant to the member's election, except that with respect to employer contributions that are required pursuant to section 38-771, subsection E for periods of a member's employment before July 1, 1999, the employer shall make a lump sum payment to ASRS as computed pursuant to subsection G of this section and required to be paid to ASRS pursuant to subsection H of this section.

2. If a nonretired member elected or was deemed to have elected benefits pursuant to section 38-771 before December 31, 1995, for periods of a member's employment from and after the election or deemed election the nonretired member's employer and the member shall each continue to pay to ASRS an amount equal to seven per cent of the member's compensation in lieu of the rates established pursuant to sections 38-736 and 38-737.

3. A nonretired member who is entitled to receive benefits pursuant to this section and who never elected to receive benefits pursuant to section 38-771 may elect pursuant to section 38-747, subsections C and D to make contributions at the rate of seven per cent of the member's compensation for periods of a member's employment on or after July 1, 1999. If a member makes an election pursuant to this paragraph, the election is irrevocable as provided in section 38-747, subsection D and the member and the member's employer shall each make contributions at a rate of seven per cent of the member's compensation beginning on the effective date of the election.

4. A nonretired member who is entitled to receive benefits pursuant to this section may elect pursuant to section 38-747, subsections C, D and H to make contributions with respect to member contributions that were not made to ASRS but that could have been made pursuant to section 38-771, subsection C, paragraph 2 for periods of employment before July 1, 1999 other than member contributions for which an irrevocable election pursuant to section 38-747, subsections C and D was in effect before July 1, 1999.

5. In addition to any other employer contributions required pursuant to this section, a nonretired member's employer shall make contributions to ASRS on behalf of the nonretired member who will receive retirement benefits pursuant to this section to pay the actuarially determined amount necessary to provide the group health and accident insurance benefits for the nonretired member and the nonretired member's dependents as provided under section 38-783.

6. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, an election permitted pursuant to this section shall not revoke, amend or alter any irrevocable election made by a member before July 1, 1999 pursuant to sections 38-747 and 38-771.

G. Effective on July 1, 1999, ASRS shall recompute the monthly and annual benefits for retired members entitled to receive benefits pursuant to this section and the monthly or lump sum survivor's benefits payable to beneficiaries entitled to receive benefits pursuant to this section. The recomputation of benefits shall be as if the member's retirement account or retirement reserve account on the date of retirement or death had been computed based on the amounts that would have been credited to the account as of that date based on the contribution amounts prescribed in subsection C, paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section. In addition and after recomputing benefits described in this subsection, with respect to members who retired on or after July 1, 1984, ASRS shall recompute the annual payments that would have been made to the member or beneficiary of a deceased member entitled to receive benefits under this section in excess of the annual payments actually made. The recomputation shall be calculated and paid as follows:

1. The recomputation shall be calculated and paid based on the member's and, if applicable, the member's beneficiary's age, the benefit option selected at the date of the initial benefit payments and the actuarial assumptions used by ASRS at the time the initial benefit payments were computed.

2. Before July 1, 2000, ASRS shall pay to the retired member or beneficiary in a lump sum the difference between the recomputed amount and the actual distributions paid to the member or beneficiary through July 1, 1999, together with interest at the rate of eight per cent a year, compounded monthly, computed from the date each excess payment should have been paid through the date of payment to the retired member or beneficiary.

3. If the retired member is living, ASRS shall pay the lump sum payment to the member. If the member is deceased and is survived by a beneficiary who is then living and receiving a monthly benefit on account of the deceased member, ASRS shall pay the lump sum payment to the beneficiary. The payment to the beneficiary shall include the recomputed amount that is payable pursuant to this section and that would have been paid to the member through the date of the member's death plus the recomputed amount that is payable pursuant to this section and that would have been payable to the beneficiary from the member's date of death. Section 38-770 applies to a payment to a member or the member's beneficiary who is the surviving spouse of the member, if the payment is substantially larger or smaller than the monthly benefit payable by ASRS to the member.

4. With respect to a beneficiary who is a survivor of a deceased nonretired member who would have been entitled to benefits under this section and who elected a lump sum distribution of the survivor benefit that was payable on the death of the nonretired member, ASRS shall pay the recomputed amount in a lump sum to the beneficiary. If the beneficiary is the surviving spouse of the member, section 38-770 applies to the payment.

5. Effective on July 1, 1999, ASRS shall increase the member's or beneficiary's monthly and annual benefit to the recomputed amount. After that adjustment, ASRS shall adjust the member's or beneficiary's annual benefit as otherwise provided under the defined contribution program administered by ASRS.

H. Before July 1, 2002, the employer of each nonretired or retired member or deceased member who has a beneficiary entitled to adjustments and payments pursuant to subsections E and G of this section for periods of a member's employment before July 1, 1999 shall pay to ASRS in one or more installments those amounts required by ASRS to make the recomputations and adjustments pursuant to this section. ASRS shall determine the amount to be paid by the employer to ASRS as of July 1, 1999, plus interest at the rate of eight per cent a year, compounded monthly, from July 1, 1999 through the date the payment is made by the employer to ASRS. Any payments by the employer shall first be applied to accrued and unpaid interest and then to the amount to be paid by the employer to ASRS. ASRS shall allocate the payment to the assets maintained under the defined contribution program administered by ASRS. When determining the amounts required to be paid by employers for the recomputations and adjustments pursuant to this section, ASRS first shall transfer on July 1, 1999 from the assets maintained by ASRS under the defined benefit program established by this article to the assets maintained by ASRS under the defined contribution program administered by ASRS an amount equal to the sum of the defined benefit program equity balances of the retired and nonretired members or their beneficiaries whose benefits are transferred from the defined benefit program to the defined contribution program pursuant to this section, except that the amount transferred for any member or beneficiary shall not be more than the amount required to fund the recomputations and adjustments required by this section for the member or beneficiary. The defined benefit program equity balance for a member or beneficiary of a deceased member shall equal the sum of the member's employee and employer account balances on the earlier of June 30, 1999 or the member's retirement or death, less the monthly annuity payments to a retired member or beneficiary, plus the earnings on the average balance of that amount for a plan year.

I. If a member retired before July 1, 1999, elected to receive benefits pursuant to section 38-771, subsection C, paragraph 2 and did not make all contributions pursuant to section 38-771, subsection E because of the limitations prescribed in section 38-747, subsection E, the member has the option of receiving the employer contributions prescribed in subsection C, paragraphs 3 and 5 of this section in a lump sum payment. If the retired member elects to receive a lump sum payment, ASRS shall pay the amount on or before July 1, 2000 and the amount shall be deducted from the member's account when computing the annuity benefits to which the member is otherwise entitled pursuant to this section. In no case shall the payment under this subsection duplicate the payment under subsection G of this section. Section 38-770 applies to a payment to a member under this subsection if the payment is substantially larger or smaller than the monthly benefit payable by ASRS to the member.

J. Contributions made to ASRS by a member and the member's employer pursuant to subsection F of this section, other than employer contributions required pursuant to subsections G and H of this section, shall not exceed, in any one limitation year, the limits prescribed in section 38-747, subsection E. If for any reason the member and applicable employer contributions made pursuant to subsection F of this section would at the time the contributions are due, taking into account other annual additions due to ASRS for the limitation year, exceed the limits prescribed in section 38-747, subsection E, the amount to be paid by the member and the member's employer pursuant to subsection F of this section, other than employer contributions required pursuant to subsections G and H of this section, shall be proportionately reduced and the reduction shall be carried into the succeeding limitation year and paid by the member and the member's employer within thirty days after the beginning of that limitation year, unless the limits prescribed in section 38-747, subsection E would again be exceeded. If the limits are exceeded again, the procedure prescribed in this subsection shall be repeated until all of the contributions are made. If more than one employer is contributing on behalf of a member, the reduction and contributions in succeeding years shall be proportionately allocated among the employers. If a member retires before making all contributions pursuant to this section because of the limitations prescribed in section 38-747, subsection E, the member's benefits pursuant to this section shall be computed only with reference to the contributions actually made. For the purposes of this subsection, "limitation year" has the same meaning prescribed in section 38-769.

K. Unless otherwise provided in this section, a member who receives retirement benefits pursuant to this section and section 38-771 is subject to conditions that are equivalent to those imposed before the member's transfer from the defined contribution program administered by ASRS to the defined benefit program established by this article. Those conditions include the following:

1. A member who attains sixty-five years of age may retire and, on application, shall receive a life annuity derived from the member's prior service credit, if any, together with a life annuity derived from the member's retirement account. The annuity is payable in equal monthly installments. The amount of the installments is based on the age of the member at the date of commencement of retirement and is determined by the interest and life expectancy tables applicable at the date of the commencement of retirement.

2. If a retired member who is receiving retirement benefits pursuant to this section dies before receipt of annuity payments in an amount equal to the member's retirement account balance immediately before retirement, ASRS shall pay the member's designated beneficiary or estate in a lump sum the difference between the retirement account balance and the total amount of annuity payments received.

3. A member who attains sixty-five years of age with at least five years of creditable service may retire and, on application, may elect to receive in lieu of the annuity payments from the member's prior service, if any, together with a life annuity derived from the member's retirement account as provided in paragraph 1 of this subsection, the actuarial equivalent of those retirement benefits under one of the options established by the board.

4. A member who attains sixty years of age with at least five years of creditable service may retire and, on application, may receive a life annuity derived from the actuarial equivalent of the member's prior service credit, if any, together with a life annuity derived from the member's retirement account. The annuity shall be determined and paid in the manner set forth in paragraph 1 of this subsection.

5. In lieu of the retirement benefits pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subsection, on application, a member may elect to receive the actuarial equivalent of those retirement benefits under one of the options established by the board.

6. If a retired member who is receiving retirement benefits pursuant to this section is engaged to work by an employer for twenty or more weeks in a fiscal year and twenty hours or more a week, the member's retirement benefit payments pursuant to this section are suspended until the member terminates employment. On return to employment, the member shall accrue benefits pursuant to this section, unless the member elects to be covered by the defined benefit program established by this article. If a formerly retired member elects to be covered by the defined benefit program established by this article, the formerly retired member shall be an active member in the defined benefit program with respect to all service performed after the member's return to work and shall not accrue additional benefits pursuant to this section. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, if a retired member begins or returns to employment as an elected official or to any other type of service or employment that does not require the retired member to begin active membership in the defined contribution program administered by ASRS or the defined benefit program established by this article, the payment of retirement benefits pursuant to this section shall not be terminated, withheld or interrupted because of beginning or returning to the service or employment or holding the elected office, unless the formerly retired member actually elects to recommence active participation in the defined benefit program established by this article or pursuant to this section.

7. On termination of employment of a retired member previously receiving retirement benefits pursuant to this section, ASRS shall reinstate the member's retirement benefits pursuant to this section and, on reinstatement of retirement benefits, the benefit shall be recomputed on the basis of the member's attained age and shall be adjusted for retirement benefits previously received and additional contributions, interest and supplemental credits accrued during the period of employment. On this reinstatement of retirement benefits, if the member elected to be covered by the defined benefit program established by this article on the member's return to employment, the member is also entitled to receive retirement benefits pursuant to the defined benefit program established by this article for the credited service earned by the member after the member's active membership in the defined benefit program established by this article began.

L. ASRS shall handle all retirement accounts of members who elect retirement benefits provided pursuant to this section and all member and employer contributions attributable to those members in the same manner as retirement accounts and contributions that are part of the defined contribution program administered by ASRS. Retirement accounts of members who elect to receive retirement benefits pursuant to this section are eligible for interest and supplemental credits on the same basis as members who retired under the defined contribution program administered by ASRS.

M. The receipt of retirement benefits by a member pursuant to this section is a waiver of all claims and demands by the member that the retirement benefits are less than the amount of retirement benefits payable to the member under the defined contribution program administered by ASRS if the member had remained a member of the defined contribution program administered by ASRS.

N. The board may administer and interpret this section in order to prevent any duplication of benefits provided by ASRS and the defined contribution program administered by ASRS and to provide all eligible members and beneficiaries with the benefits they are entitled to under the laws of this state.

O. For purposes of this section:

1. "Beneficiary" means the individual designated by the member in writing on forms approved by ASRS to receive benefits pursuant to this article after the death of the member.

#### Section 38-772. Prior service under defined contribution program administered by ASRS; definitions

A. Amounts required of employers as provided in section 38-737, subsections A and B are in addition to any payments required of employers on behalf of prior service credits under the defined contribution program administered by ASRS arising from members of ASRS. Payments made to ASRS on behalf of members with those prior service credits shall reduce by that amount the payments required to be paid to the defined contribution program administered by ASRS for those prior service credits.

B. Notwithstanding section 38-757, subsection B, any prior service credits to which the member was entitled under the defined contribution program administered by ASRS shall be added to the product of section 38-757, subsection B, paragraphs 1 and 2.

#### Section 38-774. Excess benefit arrangement

A. A separate unfunded governmental excess benefit arrangement is established outside of and apart from the trust fund established by section 38-712 to pay members benefits that are otherwise payable by ASRS and that exceed the limitations on benefits imposed by section 415 of the internal revenue code. The board shall administer this excess benefit arrangement as a qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement pursuant to section 415(m) of the internal revenue code.

B. The board may adopt rules to implement this section subject to the following:

1. Benefits under this section are subject to section 38-773 and section 38-791, subsections D and F and are exempt from execution to the same extent as provided in section 38-792.

2. Contributions to this arrangement are not held in trust and shall not be commingled with other monies of ASRS.

C. A member is entitled to a monthly benefit under this section in an amount equal to the amount that the member's benefit that is payable by ASRS has been reduced by the limitation on benefits imposed by section 38-769 and section 415 of the internal revenue code. The benefit that is payable by this arrangement shall be paid at such time or times and in such form as the benefit under ASRS would be paid.

D. The benefit that is payable under this section shall be paid with employer contributions that would otherwise be made to ASRS under section 38-737. In lieu of the employer contributions being paid to the trust fund established by section 38-712, an amount determined by ASRS as necessary to pay benefits under this section shall be paid on a monthly basis to a separate account established by the board for this arrangement and may include amounts needed to pay reasonable and necessary expenses of this arrangement. The director may invest the monies in this account in suitable short-term investments between receipt of the monies and disbursement of the monies. The amount shall be paid to the account at least fifteen days before a disbursement is to be made under this section.

E. A member shall not directly or indirectly elect to defer compensation to purchase benefits provided under this section.

F. This section shall not be construed as requiring an employer or ASRS to purchase any investment or any contract to secure any obligations under this section. If an employer or ASRS purchases an investment or contract that the employer or ASRS earmarks to pay benefits under this section, title to and beneficial ownership of the investment or contract remain at all times in the employer or ASRS, and the member and the member's beneficiaries, if any, do not have any proprietary interest in any specific assets of the employer or ASRS. Any rights of the member and the member's beneficiaries, if any, to payment of any amounts under this section shall be those of general unsecured creditors of the employer or ASRS. This section and any action taken pursuant to this section by the employer or ASRS do not create and shall not be construed to create an irrevocable trust of any kind.

#### Section 38-775. Required distributions; definitions

A. This section applies for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning on and after January 1, 2006. In applying the requirements of this section, the following operational provisions govern:

1. Except as provided in the following sentence, the requirements of this section take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of this article and article 2.1 of this chapter. The rules of this section shall not restrict any form, calculation, adjustment or payment of benefit provided under this article in effect on April 17, 2002, if the form, calculation, adjustment or payment of benefit satisfied section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code based on a reasonable and good faith interpretation of that section.

2. All distributions required under this section shall be determined and made pursuant to section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section by the United States secretary of the treasury.

3. Notwithstanding this section, other than paragraph 2 of this subsection, distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, pursuant to section 242(b)(2) of the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 (P.L. 97-248) and the provisions of this article that relate to that section.

B. The member's entire interest shall be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member not later than the member's required beginning date.

C. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest shall be distributed, or begin to be distributed, not later than as follows:

1. If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, except as provided in paragraph 4 of this subsection, distributions to the surviving spouse shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained seventy-two years of age, if later.

2. If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, except as provided in paragraph 4 of this subsection, distributions to the designated beneficiary shall begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died.

3. For purposes of this subsection and subsection G of this section, distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under paragraph 1 of this subsection. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date, or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under paragraph 1 of this subsection, the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.

4. If the member dies before distributions begin and there is a designated beneficiary, distribution to the designated beneficiary is not required to begin by the date prescribed in paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection as long as the member's entire interest will be distributed to the designated beneficiary by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to either the member or the surviving spouse begin, this paragraph applies as if the surviving spouse were the member.

D. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution, calendar year distributions shall be made pursuant to subsections E, F and G of this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions shall be made pursuant to the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section by the United States secretary of the treasury. Any part of the member's interest that is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the internal revenue code shall be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section by the United States secretary of the treasury that apply to individual accounts.

E. The following provisions govern the determination of the amount to be distributed each calendar year:

1. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions, payments under the annuity shall satisfy the following requirements:

(a) The annuity distributions shall be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year.

(b) The distribution period shall be over a life or lives or over a period certain not longer than the period described in subsection F or G of this section.

(c) Once payments have begun over a period certain, the period certain shall not be changed even if the period certain is shorter than the maximum allowed.

(d) Payments shall either be nonincreasing or increase only as follows:

(i) By an annual percentage increase that does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that is based on prices of all items and issued by the bureau of labor statistics.

(ii) To the extent of the reduction in the amount of the member's payments to provide for a survivor benefit on death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the distribution period described in subsection F of this section dies or is no longer the member's beneficiary pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) of the internal revenue code.

(iii) To provide cash refunds of employee contributions on the member's death.

(iv) To pay increased benefits that result from a plan amendment.

2. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under subsection C, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section, is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, such as bimonthly, monthly, semiannually or annually. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year shall be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date.

3. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year shall be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the amount accrues.

F. The following provisions govern annuity distributions that commence during a member's lifetime:

1. If the member's interest is being distributed in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the member and a nonspouse beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or after the member's required beginning date to the designated beneficiary after the member's death must not at any time exceed the applicable percentage of the annuity payment for the period that would have been payable to the member using the table set forth in question and answer number 2 of 401(a)(9)-6 of the regulations issued by the United States secretary of the treasury. If the form of distribution combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the member and a nonspouse beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in the preceding sentence applies to annuity payments to be made to the designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.

2. Unless the member's spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity distribution commencing during the member's lifetime may not exceed the applicable distribution period for the member under the uniform lifetime table prescribed in 401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations issued by the United States secretary of the treasury for the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.  If the annuity starting date precedes the year in which the member reaches seventy years of age, the applicable distribution period for the member is the distribution period for seventy years of age under the uniform lifetime table set forth in 401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations issued by the United States secretary of the treasury plus the excess of seventy over the age of the member as of the member's birthday in the year that contains the annuity starting date. If the member's spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the member's applicable distribution period, as determined under this paragraph, or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the member and the member's spouse as determined under the joint and last survivor table prescribed in 401(a)(9)-9 of the regulations issued by the United States secretary of the treasury, using the member's and spouse's attained ages as of the member's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.

G. The following provisions govern minimum distributions if a member dies before the date distributions begin:

1. Except as provided in subsection C, paragraph 4 of this section, if the member dies before the date distribution of the member's interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the member's entire interest shall be distributed, beginning not later than the time prescribed in subsection C, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section, over the life of the designated beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding either of the following:

(a) Unless the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year of the member's death.

(b) If the annuity starting date is before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity starting date.

2. If the member dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, distribution of the member's entire interest shall be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death.

3. If the member dies before the date distribution of the member's interest begins, the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection applies as if the surviving spouse were the member, except that the time by which distributions must begin shall be determined without regard to subsection C, paragraph 1 of this section.

H. If a member dies after the member's required beginning date and the member had not commenced distribution of retirement benefits, ASRS shall treat the member as having commenced distribution of retirement benefits on the member's required beginning date.  Notwithstanding section 38-776, ASRS shall determine the member's retirement benefit as a straight annuity as of the date of the member's required beginning date. The member's estate is entitled to the member's benefit payments and any remaining member contributions on account shall be disbursed pursuant to section 38-763.

I. For the purposes of this section:

"Designated beneficiary" means the individual who is designated as the member's beneficiary to receive benefits under this article and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and question and answer number 1 of 401(a)(9)-4 of the regulations issued by the United States secretary of the treasury.

2. "Distribution calendar year" means a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required.  For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year that contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to subsection C of this section.

1. The member is not married.

2. The member's current spouse has no identifiable community property interest in the member's benefits.

3. The member does not know, and has taken all reasonable steps to determine, the location of the member's current spouse.

4. The member has received notification from the board that a domestic relations order is acceptable pursuant to section 38-773 and that domestic relations order requires ASRS to pay benefits to an alternate payee that is contrary to the requirements of section 38-760.

5. Obtaining consent violates another law, an existing contract or a court order.

D. This section does not abrogate any community property laws of this state.

E. Payments or distributions made by ASRS in good faith reliance on the consent or waiver of a member's current spouse, the affirmations of a member contained in documents submitted to ASRS pursuant to this section or the member's indication to ASRS that the member is not married constitute a full and complete discharge and release of all liability of the board or ASRS, or both, respecting these payments or distributions.

F. If questions arise as to the distribution of a particular member's account, ASRS shall use reasonable judgment to distribute the account in a manner that is consistent with Arizona community property laws and interpretations of those laws.

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all elected officials are members of the plan, except that a state elected official who is subject to term limits may elect not to participate in the plan.  The state elected official who is subject to term limits shall make the election in writing and file the election with the board within thirty days after the state elected official assumes office.  The election is effective on the first day of the state elected official's eligibility for that term of office. The election not to participate is specific for that term of office. If a state elected official who is subject to term limits fails to make an election as provided in this subsection, the state elected official is deemed to have elected to participate in the plan.  The election not to participate in the plan is irrevocable and constitutes a waiver of all benefits provided by the plan for the state elected official's entire term, except for any benefits accrued by the state elected official in the plan for periods of participation before being elected to an office subject to term limits or any benefits expressly provided by law. The state elected official who elects not to participate in the plan shall participate in the Arizona state retirement system unless the state elected official makes an irrevocable election not to participate in the Arizona state retirement system as provided in section 38-727.

B. All elected officials who are members of the plan on December 31, 2013 may remain members of the plan under the terms and limitations of this article.

C. If a member who becomes a member of the plan before January 1, 2012 ceases to hold office for any reason other than death or retirement, within twenty days after filing a completed application with the board, the member is entitled to receive the following amounts, less any benefit payments the member has received and any amount the member may owe to the plan:

1. If the member has less than five years of credited service with the plan, the member may withdraw the member's accumulated contributions from the plan.

2. If the member has five or more years of credited service with the plan, the member may withdraw the member's accumulated contributions plus an amount equal to the amount determined as follows:

(a) 5.0 to 5.9 years of credited service, twenty-five percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-810, subsection A.

(b) 6.0 to 6.9 years of credited service, forty percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-810, subsection A.

(c) 7.0 to 7.9 years of credited service, fifty-five percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-810, subsection A.

(d) 8.0 to 8.9 years of credited service, seventy percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-810, subsection A.

(e) 9.0 to 9.9 years of credited service, eighty-five percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-810, subsection A.

(f) 10.0 or more years of credited service, one hundred percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-810, subsection A.

D. If a member has more than ten years of credited service with the plan, leaves the monies prescribed in subsection C of this section on account with the plan for more than thirty days after termination of employment and after that time period requests a refund of those monies, the member is entitled to receive the amount prescribed in subsection C of this section plus interest at a rate determined by the board for each year computed from and after the member's termination of employment.

E. If an elected official who becomes a member of the plan on or after January 1, 2012 ceases to hold office for any reason other than death or retirement, within twenty days after filing a completed application with the board, the member may withdraw the member's accumulated contributions from the plan and shall be paid the member's accumulated contributions plus interest at a rate determined by the board as of the date of termination, less any benefit payments the member has received and any amount the member may owe to the plan.

F. If the amount prescribed in subsection C, D or E of this section includes monies that are an eligible rollover distribution and the member elects to have the distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account or annuity and specifies the eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account or annuity to which the distribution is to be paid, the distribution shall be made in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to the specified eligible retirement plan. The distribution shall be made in the form and at the time prescribed by the board.  A member who receives the amount prescribed in subsection C, D or E of this section from the plan or who elects a transfer pursuant to this subsection forfeits the member's credited service, and all rights to benefits under the plan and membership in the plan terminate.

G. For distributions occurring from and after December 31, 2007, a member or a member's beneficiary, including a nonspouse designated beneficiary to the extent allowed under subsection H of this section, may roll over an eligible rollover distribution as defined in section 402(c)(4) of the internal revenue code to a Roth individual retirement account, if, for distributions occurring before January 1, 2010, the member or the member's beneficiary satisfies the requirements for making a Roth individual retirement account contribution under section 408A(c)(3)(B) of the internal revenue code, as in effect on the date of the rollover. Any amount rolled over to a Roth individual retirement account is included in the gross income of the member or the member's beneficiary to the extent the amounts would have been included in gross income if not rolled over as required under section 408A(d)(3)(A) of the internal revenue code. For the purposes of this subsection, the administrator is not responsible for ensuring the member or the member's beneficiary is eligible to make a rollover to a Roth individual retirement account.

H. For distributions made from and after December 31, 2009, a nonspouse designated beneficiary as defined in section 401(a)(9)(E) of the internal revenue code may elect to directly roll over an eligible rollover distribution to an individual retirement account under section 408(a) of the internal revenue code or an individual retirement annuity under section 408(b) of the internal revenue code that is established on behalf of the designated beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited individual retirement plan pursuant to section 402(c)(11) of the internal revenue code. In order to be able to roll over the distribution, the distribution otherwise must satisfy the definition of an eligible rollover distribution as defined in section 402(c)(4) of the internal revenue code.  In applying this subsection, a nonspouse rollover is subject to the direct rollover requirements under section 401(a)(31) of the internal revenue code, the rollover notice requirements under section 402(f) of the internal revenue code and the mandatory withholding requirements under section 3405(c) of the internal revenue code.

I. For plan years occurring before January 1, 2007, the period for providing the rollover notice as required under section 402(f) of the internal revenue code is not less than thirty days and not more than ninety days before the date of distribution and, for plan years beginning from and after December 31, 2006, the period for providing the rollover notice as required under section 402(f) of the internal revenue code is not less than thirty days and not more than one hundred eighty days before the date of distribution.

J. In no case shall more than twelve months of credited service be credited on account of all service rendered by a member in any one year.

K. If an elected official who has terminated the member's membership in the plan pursuant to subsection C of this section is subsequently elected, appointed or hired on or after January 1, 2014, the elected official is not eligible to become a member of the plan but is subject to article 3.1 of this chapter.

L. Notwithstanding subsection K of this section, if an elected official files a written election form with the board within ninety days after the day of the member's reemployment as an elected official and repays the amount previously withdrawn pursuant to subsection C or D of this section within one year after the date of the member's reemployment as an elected official, with interest on that amount at the rate of nine percent for each year, compounded each year from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment, credited service shall be restored.  Credited service shall not be restored until complete repayment is made to the fund.

M. An elected official who is elected, appointed or hired on or after January 1, 2014 and who was not a member of the plan on December 31, 2013 is not eligible to become a member of the plan but is subject to article 3.1 of this chapter.

N. If a retired member subsequently becomes an elected official, contributions shall not be made by the retired member and credited service shall not accrue while the retired member is holding office.

O. In addition to subsection N of this section, if a retired member subsequently becomes, by reason of election or reelection, an elected official of the same office from which the member retired within a time period following the member's retirement that is less than one full term for that office, the member shall not receive a pension. Any pension payments received by a member, who retired on or after July 1, 2009, while holding the same office from which the member retired within one full term after the date of retirement are considered overpayments pursuant to section 38-809, subsection A and are subject to repayment up to the maximum of only the amount received during that term.  If the elected official ceases to hold the same office, the elected official is entitled to receive the same pension the elected official was receiving when the elected official's pension was discontinued pursuant to this subsection. This subsection does not prohibit a retired judge called by the supreme court to active duties of a judge pursuant to section 38-813 from receiving retirement benefits.

#### Section 38-804.01. Reinstatement of credited service; effect of prior law

An elected official who received a refund as provided in section 38-804, who is subsequently reemployed as an elected official and who may have redeposited the amount withdrawn with interest as provided in section 38-804 or an elected official who redeems prior service pursuant to statute is subject to the benefits and duties in effect at the time of the elected official's most recent reemployment.  This section does not apply if a court of competent jurisdiction orders reinstatement of benefits and duties under a prior law.

#### Section 38-805. Normal retirement and early retirement pensions

A. A member who becomes a member of the plan before January 1, 2012 and who ceases to hold office is eligible for a normal retirement pension, if the member satisfies one of the following requirements:

#### Section 38-806. Disability retirement pensions

A. A member who becomes permanently mentally or physically incapacitated for the purpose of performing the duties of the member's office may receive disability retirement benefits if the board of trustees finds that all of the following apply:

1. The member submits either personally or by a guardian an affidavit as to the nature of the member's incapacity.

C. If the board of trustees has reason to believe that a member, retired pursuant to this section but not yet eligible for normal retirement, may no longer be mentally or physically incapacitated from performing the duties of the public office from which the member retired, the board of trustees may require such retired member to be medically examined. The examination shall be conducted by a board of three physicians, one designated by the administrator of the fund, one designated by the retired member or the member's guardian and one designated by the governor.

D. The board of trustees shall discontinue pension payments to a member retired pursuant to this section, if the board of physicians certifies that the member is mentally and physically capable of performing the duties of the public office from which the member retired.

C. If the deceased retired or active or inactive member does not have an eligible surviving spouse or the pension of the eligible surviving spouse is terminated, each eligible child is entitled to receive a child's pension.  A child's pension terminates if the child is adopted.  In the case of a child with a disability, the child's pension terminates if the child ceases to be under a disability or ceases to be a dependent of the surviving spouse or guardian.  The amount of the pension of each eligible child is an equal share of the amount of the surviving spouse's pension. The surviving minor or child's with a disability pension shall be paid to the person who is the legally appointed guardian or custodian of the eligible child until the eligible child reaches eighteen years of age, at which time the eligible child's pension shall be paid directly to the eligible child so long as the person remains eligible to receive the pension and is not subject to a guardianship or conservatorship due to disability or incapacity. The pension of a child with a disability who is eighteen years of age or older and who is subject to a guardianship or conservatorship due to disability or incapacity shall continue to be paid to the guardian or conservator so long as the child remains eligible for the pension payment.

D. If a member dies and no pension is payable on account of the member's death, the deceased member's accumulated contributions shall be paid to the person or persons designated by the deceased member in writing and filed with the board.

2. A member who meets the requirements for a disability retirement pension shall receive a disability pension equal to four percent of the member's average yearly salary multiplied by twenty years of credited service if the member has ten or more years of credited service, four percent of the member's average yearly salary multiplied by ten years of credited service if the member has five or more years of credited service but fewer than ten years of credited service or four percent of the member's average yearly salary multiplied by five years of credited service if the member has fewer than five years of credited service.

D. The plan shall make payments pursuant to section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section.

A. If the plan has made pension payments based on incorrect information and a person or an estate has been paid more or less than the person or estate should have been paid, the board shall adjust future payments so that the proper amount is paid. The adjustment may be made in such a manner that the equivalent actuarial present value of the benefit to which the person or estate is correctly entitled is paid.

B. Notwithstanding any other statute, benefits, member contributions or court fees including interest earnings and all other credits payable under the plan are not subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, before actually being received by the person entitled to the benefit, contribution, earning or credit under the terms of the plan, and any attempt to dispose of any right under the terms of the plan as proscribed in this subsection is void. The fund is not liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, enlargements or torts of any person entitled to a benefit, contribution, earning or credit under the terms of the plan.

C. Nothing in this section exempts employee benefits of any kind from a writ of attachment, a writ of execution, a writ of garnishment and orders of assignment issued by a court of record as the result of a judgment for arrearages of child support or for child support debt.

D. A person who defrauds the plan or who takes, converts, steals or embezzles monies owned by or from the plan and who fails or refuses to return the monies to the plan on the board's written request is subject to a civil suit by the plan in the superior court in Maricopa county. On entry of an order finding the person has defrauded the plan or taken, converted, stolen or embezzled monies owned by or from the plan, the court shall enter an order against that person and for the plan awarding the plan all of its costs and expenses of any kind, including attorney fees, that were necessary to successfully prosecute the action.  The court shall also grant the plan a judicial lien on all of the nonexempt property of the person against whom judgment is entered pursuant to this subsection in an amount equal to all amounts awarded to the plan, plus interest at the rate prescribed by section 44-1201, until all amounts owed are paid to the plan.

E. If a member is convicted of, or discharged because of, theft, embezzlement, fraud or misappropriation of an employer's property or property under the control of the employer, the member is subject to restitution and fines imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction.  The court may order the restitution or fines to be paid from any payments otherwise payable to the member from the plan.

F. A person who knowingly makes any false statement or who falsifies or permits to be falsified any record of the plan with an intent to defraud the plan is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.  If any change or error in the records results in any member or beneficiary receiving from the plan more or less than the member or beneficiary would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the plan shall correct the error, and as far as practicable shall adjust the payments in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member or beneficiary was correctly entitled to receive shall be paid. If a member is convicted of a crime pursuant to this subsection, the member is entitled to receive a lump sum payment of the member's accumulated contributions but forfeits any future compensation and benefits that would otherwise accrue to the member or the member's estate under this article.

G. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the board may offset against any benefits otherwise payable by the plan to an active or retired member or survivor any court ordered amounts awarded to the board and plan and assessed against the member or survivor.

 

#### Section 38-810. Contributions; appropriations

A. Each member shall contribute to the fund an amount equal to the amount prescribed in subsection G of this section. Contributions of members shall be made by payroll deductions. Every member is deemed to consent to these deductions. Payment of a member's compensation, less these payroll deductions, constitutes a full and complete discharge and satisfaction of all claims and demands by the member relating to remuneration for the member's services rendered during the period covered by the payment, except with respect to the benefits provided under the plan.  A member may not, under any circumstance, borrow from, take a loan against or remove contributions from the member's account before the termination of membership in the plan or the receipt of a pension.

B. The board's office shall be credited monthly with monies collected pursuant to section 12-119.01, subsection B, paragraph 2, section 12-120.31, subsection D, paragraph 2, section 12-284.03, subsection A, paragraph 6, section 22-281, subsection C, paragraph 3 and section 41-178. The monies credited to the fund pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the fund on a monthly basis, and there shall be a complete accounting of the determination of these monies deposited in the fund.

C. Beginning on July 1, 2018, as determined by actuarial valuations performed by the plan's actuary each employer shall make contributions on a level percent of compensation basis for all employees of the employer who are either members under this article, article 3.1 of this chapter or article 2 of this chapter pursuant to section 38-727, subsection B sufficient under the actuarial valuation to meet both the normal cost plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the unfunded accrued liability over a closed period of at least twenty and not more than thirty years that is established by the board taking into account the recommendation of the plan's actuary and the employer's contribution under the elected officials' defined contribution retirement system established pursuant to article 3.1 of this chapter and the employer's contribution under article 2 of this chapter for members who are eligible pursuant to section 38-727, subsection B. The employer also shall pay the amount required by section 38-797.05 for members under article 2 of this chapter who are eligible pursuant to section 38-727, subsection B and the amount required by article 3.2 of this chapter for members under article 3.1 of this chapter. The monies deposited in the fund pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be used to supplement the contributions required of all employers under the plan. The employer level percent compensation contribution that is paid pursuant to this subsection, less the amount contributed by the employer pursuant to section 38-833 and section 38-737 for members eligible pursuant to section 38-727, subsection B, shall not be used to pay for an increase in benefits that is otherwise payable to members but shall be used to meet the normal cost plus an amount to amortize the unfunded accrued liability.

D. In any fiscal year, an employer's contribution to the plan in combination with member contributions may not be less than the actuarially determined normal cost for that fiscal year.  After the close of any fiscal year, if the plan's actuary determines that the actuarial valuation of the fund contains excess valuation assets and is more than one hundred percent funded, the board shall account for fifty percent of the excess valuation assets in a stabilization reserve account.  After the close of any fiscal year, if the plan's actuary determines that the actuarial valuation of the fund has a valuation asset deficiency and an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, the board shall use any valuation assets in the stabilization reserve account, to the extent available, to limit the decline in the fund's funding ratio to not more than two percent.

E. The department of administration and the treasurer of each county and participating city and town shall transfer to the board the contributions provided for in subsections A and C of this section within ten working days after each payroll date. The state, county treasurers and clerks of the superior court shall transfer the monies credited under subsection B of this section to the board on or before the fifteenth day of each calendar month that follows the month in which the court fees were collected. Contributions and monies credited under subsection B of this section and transferred after these dates shall include a penalty equal to ten percent a year, compounded annually, for each day that the contributions or monies credited under subsection B of this section are late. Delinquent payments due under this subsection, together with interest charges as provided in this subsection and court costs, may be recovered by action in a court of competent jurisdiction against the person or persons responsible for the payments or, at the request of the board, may be deducted from any other monies, including excise revenue taxes, payable to a political subdivision by any department or agency of this state. If requested by the board, the state, county treasurers or clerks of the superior court shall transfer the monies credited under subsection B of this section, in an amount determined by the board, directly to the qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement established pursuant to section 38-803.01.

F. The employer shall pay the member contributions required of members on account of compensation earned after August 7, 1985. The paid contributions shall be treated as employer contributions for the purpose of determining tax treatment under the United States internal revenue code.  The effective date of the employer payment shall not be before the date the retirement plan has received notification from the United States internal revenue service that pursuant to section 414(h) of the United States internal revenue code the member contributions paid will not be included in gross income for income tax purposes until the paid contributions are distributed by refund or pension payments. The employer shall pay the member contributions from monies established and available in the retirement deduction account, which monies would otherwise have been designated as member contributions and paid to the retirement plan.  Member contributions paid pursuant to this subsection shall be treated for all other purposes, in the same manner and to the same extent, as member contributions made before August 7, 1985.

G. An elected official who became a member of the plan before July 20, 2011 shall contribute seven percent of the member's gross salary pursuant to subsection A of this section.  The amount contributed pursuant to subsection A of this section by an elected official who became a member of the plan on or after July 20, 2011 is: 

1. For fiscal year 2011-2012, ten percent of the member's gross salary.

2. For fiscal year 2012-2013, eleven and one-half percent of the member's gross salary.

3. For fiscal year 2013-2014 and each fiscal year thereafter, thirteen percent of the member's gross salary.

H. For fiscal year 2011-2012 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount of the member's contribution that exceeds seven percent of the member's compensation shall not be used to reduce the employer's contributions that are calculated pursuant to subsection C of this section.

I. In fiscal years 2013-2014 through 2042-2043, the sum of $5,000,000 is appropriated in each fiscal year from the state general fund to the elected officials' retirement plan fund to supplement the normal cost plus an amount to amortize the unfunded accrued liability pursuant to subsection C of this section. Monies appropriated pursuant to this subsection shall not be used to pay for an increase in benefits that is otherwise payable to members and shall only be used as specified in this subsection.  Monies appropriated pursuant to this subsection are exempt from the provisions of section 35-190 relating to lapsing of appropriations.

#### Section 38-810.01. Internal revenue code qualification

The legislature intends that the plan is a qualified pension plan under section 401 of the internal revenue code, as amended, or successor provisions of law, and that the trust is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the internal revenue code, as amended.  The assets of the fund are held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the plan.  The board may adopt such additional provisions to the plan as are necessary to fulfill this intent.

 

#### Section 38-810.02. Statutory construction

A. Because the plan as enacted at a particular time is a unique amalgam of rights and obligations having a critical impact on the actuarial integrity of the plan, the legislature intends that the plan as enacted at a particular time be construed and applied as a coherent whole and without reference to any other provision of the plan in effect at a different time.

B. The plan was established in order to provide a uniform, consistent and equitable statewide program for those eligible elected officials as defined by the plan.  A member of the plan does not have a vested right to benefits under the plan until the member files an application for benefits and is found eligible for those benefits.  An eligible claimant's right to benefits vests on the date of the member's application for those benefits or the member's last day of employment under the plan, whichever occurs first.

#### Section 38-810.03. Compensation limitation; adjustments

A. The annual compensation of each member taken into account for purposes of the plan shall not exceed the following:

1. Beginning January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2001, one hundred fifty thousand dollars.

2. Beginning January 1, 2002, two hundred thousand dollars.

B. If compensation under the plan is determined for a period of time that contains fewer than twelve calendar months, the compensation limit for that period of time is equal to the dollar limit for the calendar year during which the period of time begins, multiplied by the fraction in which the numerator is the number of full months in that period of time and the denominator is twelve.

C. The board shall adjust the annual compensation limits under this section at the same time and in the same manner as adjusted by the United States secretary of the treasury under section 401(a)(17)(B) of the internal revenue code.  The adjustment under this subsection for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the plan year that begins with or within the calendar year.

 

#### Section 38-810.04. Retired member; return to work; employer contributions

A. An employer shall pay contributions at an alternate contribution rate on behalf of a retired member who returns to work in any capacity in a position ordinarily filled by an elected official of the employer.  This section applies to a retired member who has been retired for more than one full term for that office.

B. The alternate contribution rate shall be equal to that portion of the total required contribution that is applied to the amortization of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability for the fiscal year beginning July 1, based on the plan's actuary's calculation of the total required contribution for the preceding fiscal year ended on June 30.  The alternate contribution rate shall be applied to the compensation, gross salary or contract fee of a retired member who meets the requirements of this section.

C. The alternate contribution rate shall not be less than ten per cent in any fiscal year.

D. All contributions made by the employer and allocated to the fund established by section 38-802 are irrevocable and shall be used as benefits under this article or to pay the expenses of the plan. Payments made pursuant to this section by employers become delinquent after the due date prescribed in section 38-810, subsection E, and thereafter shall be increased by interest from and after that date until payment is received by the plan.

E. An employer of a retired member shall submit any reports, data, paperwork or materials that are requested by the board and that are necessary to determine the compensation, gross salary or contract fee associated with a retired member who returns to work or to determine the function, use, efficacy or operation of the return to work program.

 

#### Section 38-810.05. Required distributions

All distributions required under this article shall be determined and made pursuant to section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section by the United States secretary of the treasury.

 

#### Section 38-811. Taxation of benefits; exemption of contributions and securities

The member and employer contributions and the securities in the fund are exempt from state, county and municipal taxes.  Member and employer contributions that are made to and subsequently withdrawn from the fund after December 31, 1974 by a member from the accounts of the plan and are not received as benefits from the plan and benefits, annuities and pensions received by a member from the plan after December 31, 1988 are subject to state taxes pursuant to title 43.

#### Section 38-812. Maximum annual pension; limitations; definition

A. The maximum annual pension for a limitation year shall not exceed the following:

1. For limitation years beginning before 1995, the lesser of ninety thousand dollars, as indexed for inflation, or one hundred per cent of the member's average yearly salary.

2. For limitation years beginning in 1995 and ending before 2002, ninety thousand dollars, as indexed for inflation.

3. For limitation years ending in and after 2002, one hundred sixty thousand dollars, as indexed for inflation.

B. The limitations prescribed in subsection A shall be determined under section 415 of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are then in effect under that section.

C. Notwithstanding this section, the pension payable under this plan may be reduced to the extent necessary, as determined by the plan, to prevent disqualification of the plan under section 415 of the internal revenue code, which imposes additional limitations on the pension payable to members who also may be participating in another tax qualified pension plan or other plan of this state.  The plan shall advise affected members of any additional limitation of their pension required by this section.

D. For the purposes of this section, "limitation year" means the plan's fiscal year. 

 

#### Section 38-813. Availability of retired judges for certain legal services; compensation

A. Every judge retired under this plan may, if physically and mentally able, be subject to call by the supreme court or the chief justice of the supreme court to assist the supreme court, court of appeals or superior court under such directions as the supreme court may give, including the examination of the facts in cases before the court, the examination of authorities cited and the preparation of opinions for and on behalf of the court. The court may order these opinions, to the extent approved by the court, to constitute the opinion of the court. The retired judge may, subject to any rule which the supreme court adopts, perform any duties preliminary to the final disposition of cases insofar as they are not inconsistent with the constitution of this state.

B. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, a retired judge who is temporarily called back to the active duties of a judge is entitled to receive the same compensation and expenses as other like active judges less any amount received for that period in retirement benefits.

#### Section 38-814. Termination of plan; adjustment and refund

A. If the plan terminates, each member's accrued benefits to the date of termination become one hundred percent nonforfeitable to the extent funded.  After provision is made for all expenses of the plan, including expenses of liquidation, the assets of the plan shall be allocated by the payment or provision for the payment of benefits in the following order of preference:

1. To pay each elected official and nonretired former elected official an amount equal to his accumulated contributions.

2. To continue to pay pensions to retired members or their beneficiaries.

3. To provide for potential rights of elected officials and former elected officials on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis according to generally accepted actuarial principles.

4. To pay any excess to this state.

B. The allocations in subsection A of this section may be implemented through the existing trust, a new trust instrument for that purpose or the purchase by the board of insurance company contracts, or by a combination of these methods. An elected official has no rights or claims on the plan or this state beyond the capacity of the assets held by the board to provide benefits in accordance with subsection A of this section.

C. If the allocations produce a pension of less than twenty-five dollars per month for any person, the board may pay a lump sum of actuarial equivalent value in lieu of the pension.

D. If more than the correct amount of employer or member contributions is paid into the plan by an employer through a mistake of fact, the board shall return those contributions to the employer if the employer requests return of the contributions within one year after the date of the overpayment. The board may not pay an employer earnings attributable to excess contributions but shall reduce the amount returned to an employer pursuant to this subsection by the amount of losses attributable to the excess contributions.

 

#### Section 38-815. Joinder agreement

A. Elected officials of an incorporated city or town may participate in the plan if the governing body of the city or town enters into a joinder agreement with the board on behalf of its elected officials and the employer unconditionally accepts the provisions of the plan and binds its elected officials thereto. All elected officials shall be designated for membership unless written consent to the contrary is obtained from the board. A member shall be qualified for participation in order to obtain written consent to the contrary from the board.

B. The effective date of participation shall be specifically stipulated in the joinder agreement.

C. Any city or town that is considering participation in the plan shall request a preliminary actuarial survey to determine the estimated cost of participation, the benefits to be derived and such other information as may be deemed appropriate. The cost of such survey shall be paid by the city or town requesting it.

D. All assets under any existing public employee defined benefit retirement program, to the extent attributable to the city's or town's elected officials, shall be transferred from the program to this fund no later than sixty days after the city's or town's effective date of participation.  That portion of the transferred assets that is attributable to the elected official's contributions, including interest credits thereon, shall be properly allocated to each affected elected official of the city or town and credited to the elected official's accumulated contributions, in accordance with a schedule furnished by the city or town to the board.

 

#### Section 38-816. Redemption of prior service

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, an active elected official who has at least five years of credited service with the plan may elect to redeem up to sixty months of any part of the following prior service or employment by paying into the fund the amounts required under subsection C of this section if the prior service or employment is not on account with any other retirement system or plan:

1. Prior service in this state as an elected official with an employer now covered by the plan before the effective date of participation if the elected official has received a refund from a prior retirement system or plan on termination of employment before the elected official's application for redemption of prior service.

2. Prior service in this state as an elected official with an employer now covered by the plan before the effective date of participation if the elected official was not covered by a retirement system or plan during the elected official's prior elected official service.

4. Prior employment with the United States government, a state of the United States or a political subdivision of a state of the United States.

B. An active elected official who became a member of the plan before January 1, 2012 may redeem any amount of eligible prior service as specified in subsection A of this section without having to have accrued any minimum amount of credited service in the plan.

C. An active elected official who elects to redeem any part of the prior service or employment for which the elected official is deemed eligible by the board under this section shall pay into the plan the amounts previously withdrawn by the elected official as a refund of the elected official's accumulated contributions, if any, plus the additional amount, if any, that is computed by the plan's actuary and that is necessary to equal the increase in the actuarial present value of projected benefits resulting from the redemption calculated using the actuarial methods and assumptions that are prescribed by the plan's actuary.

D. On approval by the governing body of an incorporated city or town that executes a joinder agreement under section 38-815, the city or town may pay into the fund all or any part of the amount sufficient to provide retirement benefits for elected officials or former elected officials for the time of service as an elected official of the city or town before the joinder agreement if no retirement benefits were in effect for elected officials during the time of service being redeemed under this section.

E. A member electing to redeem service pursuant to this section may pay for service being redeemed in the form of a lump sum payment to the plan, a trustee-to-trustee transfer or a direct rollover of an eligible distribution from a plan described in section 402(c)(8)(B)(iii), (iv), (v) or (vi) of the internal revenue code or a rollover of an eligible distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or (b) of the internal revenue code.

If the employer cannot reasonably determine the member's rate of compensation for the period that the member was ordered into military service, contributions shall be based on the member's average rate of compensation during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the period of military service.

3. If a member has been employed less than twelve months before being ordered into military service, contributions shall be based on the member's compensation being earned immediately preceding the period of military service.

4. The member has up to three times the length of military service, not to exceed sixty months, to make the member contributions. Once the member has made the member contributions or on receipt of the member's death certificate, the employer shall make the employer contributions in a lump sum.  Death benefits shall be calculated as prescribed by law.

5. If the member's employer pays military differential wage pay to members serving in the military, contributions shall be paid to the plan pursuant to section 38-810 for any military differential wage pay paid to the member while performing military service.

G. In computing the length of total credited service of a member for the purpose of determining retirement benefits or eligibility, the period of military service, as prescribed by this section, shall be included.

H. If a member performs military service due to a presidential call-up, not to exceed forty-eight months, the employer shall make the employer and member contributions computed pursuant to subsection F of this section on the member's return and in compliance with subsection C of this section.

I. In addition to, but not in duplication of, subsection C of this section, beginning December 12, 1994 contributions, benefits and credited service provided pursuant to this section shall be provided pursuant to section 414(u) of the internal revenue code, and this section shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with that internal revenue code section.

J. For plan years beginning after December 31, 2008, a member who does not currently perform services for an employer by reason of qualified military service as defined in section 414(u)(5) of the internal revenue code is not considered having a severance from employment during that qualified military service. Any payments by the employer to the member during the qualified military service shall be considered compensation to the extent those payments do not exceed the amounts the member would have received if the member had continued to perform services for the employer rather than entering qualified military service.

K. For deaths occurring from and after December 31, 2006, in the case of a member who dies while performing qualified military service as defined in section 414(u)(5) of the internal revenue code, the survivors of the member are entitled to any benefits, other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service, provided under the plan as though the member resumed and then terminated employment on account of death.

#### Section 38-821. Charter city retirement system service credits; transfers

A. A member of a charter city retirement system who is an elected official may apply for a transfer of service credits from the charter city retirement system to the elected officials' retirement plan pursuant to this section if all of the following conditions are met:

1. The member initiates the transfer by making written application to the elected officials' retirement plan.

2. The charter city retirement system and the elected officials' retirement plan agree regarding the terms of the transfer.

3. The transfer does not cause either the charter city retirement system or the elected officials' retirement plan to incur any unfunded accrued liabilities as a result of the transfer.

B. Service credits qualified in accordance with subsection A may be transferred or redeemed in accordance with the following:

1. If a member's contributions remain on deposit with the charter city retirement system, the following shall be calculated:

(a) The charter city retirement system shall calculate the amount equal to the actuarial present value of a member's projected benefits to the extent funded on a market value basis as of the most recent actuarial valuation under the charter city retirement system as calculated by the system's actuary using the actuarial method and assumptions recommended by the system's actuary and based on the transferring member's service credits at the time of transfer.

(b) The elected officials' retirement plan shall calculate the increase in the actuarial present value of the projected benefits provided as a result of the transfer of the member's service credits. This calculation shall be performed by the plan's actuary using the actuarial method and assumptions recommended by the plan's actuary and based on the transferring member's service credits at the time of transfer.

2. If a member decides to transfer:

(a) If the amount calculated in paragraph 1, subdivision (b) of this subsection is greater than the amount calculated in paragraph 1, subdivision (a) of this subsection:

(i) The charter city retirement system shall transfer to the elected officials' retirement plan the greater of the amount calculated in paragraph 1, subdivision (a) of this subsection or the member's accumulated contribution account balance.

(ii) If the amount transferred is less than the amount calculated under paragraph 1, subdivision (b) of this subsection, the transferring member shall elect either to pay the difference or to accept a reduced transfer of service credits. If the member elects to pay the difference, the amount paid shall be added to the member's accumulated contribution account balance. If the member elects to accept a reduced transfer of service credits, the amount of service credits transferred shall be equal to the amount of service credits used in making the calculation under paragraph 1, subdivision (a) of this subsection multiplied by the ratio of the amount calculated under paragraph 1, subdivision (a) of this subsection to the amount calculated under paragraph 1, subdivision (b) of this subsection.

(b) If the amount calculated in paragraph 1, subdivision (b) of this subsection is less than or equal to the amount calculated in paragraph 1, subdivision (a) of this subsection, the charter city retirement system shall transfer to the elected officials' retirement plan the greater of the amount calculated in paragraph 1, subdivision (b) of this subsection or the member's accumulated contribution account balance.

3. If an applicant has withdrawn member contributions from the charter city retirement system, the applicant shall pay into the elected officials' retirement plan an amount equal to the increase in the actuarial present value of the projected benefits provided by the service credits being redeemed and this amount shall be included in the member's current accumulated contribution account balance. The actuary of the elected officials' retirement plan shall perform this calculation using the actuarial method and assumptions the actuary recommends.

C. Service credits shall not be applied to the applicant's account until complete payment is made to the elected officials' retirement plan. On completion of the transfer provided for in this section, the member's rights in the charter city retirement system are extinguished.

 

#### Section 38-822. Domestic relations orders; procedures; payments

A. Notwithstanding any other law, in a judicial proceeding for annulment, dissolution of marriage or legal separation that provides for the distribution of community property, or in any judicial proceeding to amend or enforce such a property distribution, a court in this state may issue a domestic relations order that provides that all or any part of a participant's benefit or refund in the plan that would otherwise be payable to that participant shall instead be paid by the plan to an alternate payee.

B. A domestic relations order is not effective against the plan unless the domestic relations order is approved by the plan and qualifies as a plan approved domestic relations order.  To qualify as a plan approved domestic relations order, a domestic relations order shall comply with any policies or procedures adopted pursuant to subsection K and shall also meet all of the following requirements:

1. The domestic relations order shall state the name and the last known mailing address of the participant and the name and last known mailing address of the alternate payee that is covered by the domestic relations order.

2. The domestic relations order shall clearly state the amount or percentage of the participant's benefits that is payable by the plan to the alternate payee or the precise manner in which the amount or percentage is to be determined.

3. The domestic relations order shall state the number of payments or periods to which the domestic relations order applies, if applicable.

4. The domestic relations order shall state that the domestic relations order applies to the plan.

5. The domestic relations order shall not require the plan to provide any type or form of benefit or any option not otherwise provided by this article.

6. The domestic relations order shall not require the plan to provide increased benefits determined on the basis of actuarial value.

7. The domestic relations order shall not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee if the benefits are required to be paid to another alternate payee under a separate plan approved domestic relations order.

8. The domestic relations order shall have been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction of a state, territory or possession of the United States.

C. On receipt by the plan of a certified copy of a domestic relations order and a written request for a determination that the domestic relations order is a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall promptly issue a written notice of receipt stating that the domestic relations order and request were received to the participant and alternate payee at the addresses on file, if any.

D. The plan has a determination period to issue a written determination indicating whether a domestic relations order qualifies as a plan approved domestic relations order.  If the participant is receiving benefits during the determination period, and if the plan can determine the amount of the benefits that currently would be payable to the alternate payee if the domestic relations order were a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall hold the segregated funds and shall pay the remaining portion of the benefits to the participant. If the plan determines the domestic relations order is a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall pay the participant and alternate payee pursuant to the plan approved domestic relations order in the month following the month in which the determination was issued, or in the month following the month in which a benefit is payable under the plan approved domestic relations order, whichever is later. If the plan determines the domestic relations order fails to qualify as a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall specify in its determination how the domestic relations order is deficient and how it may be amended to qualify as a plan approved domestic relations order.  If the participant is currently receiving benefits, and if the plan can determine the amount of segregated funds that would be payable to the alternate payee if the domestic relations order were a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall hold the segregated funds during the cure period to allow the parties to submit a certified copy of an amended domestic relations order and a written request for a determination that the amended domestic relations order is a plan approved domestic relations order.  During the cure period, the plan shall pay the participant's portion to the participant.  At the end of the cure period, if the issue of whether an amended domestic relations order qualifies as a plan approved domestic relations order remains undetermined or if an amended domestic relations order is determined not to be a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall pay the segregated funds and the participant's portion to the participant.  The participant shall hold the segregated funds in trust for the alternate payee as provided in subsection J. If an amended domestic relations order that is submitted after the expiration of the cure period is determined to be a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall make payments to an alternate payee under the plan approved domestic relations order only prospectively. A determination by the plan that a domestic relations order is not a plan approved domestic relations order does not prohibit a participant or alternate payee from submitting an amended domestic relations order to the plan.

E. Each participant and alternate payee is responsible for maintaining a current mailing address on file with the plan. The plan has no duty to attempt to locate any participant or alternate payee. The plan has no duty to provide a notice of receipt or determination or pay benefits by means other than mailing the notice or payments to the participant or alternate payee at the last known address that is on file with the plan.  If the address of an alternate payee is unknown to the plan, but benefits are payable to the alternate payee pursuant to a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall either:

1. Hold the alternate payee's portion until such a time as the alternate payee provides the plan with a current address.  Once the plan is notified of the alternate payee's current address, the plan shall prospectively pay the alternate payee's portion to the alternate payee.

2. Pay the alternate payee's portion to the participant, who shall hold the alternate payee's portion in trust as provided in subsection J, until such a time as the alternate payee is located.  At that time the participant shall pay the alternate payee's portion directly to the alternate payee.

F. If the address of a participant is unknown to the plan, but benefits are payable to the participant pursuant to a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall hold the participant's portion until the participant provides the plan with a current address.

G. If the alternate payee identified in a plan approved domestic relations order predeceases the participant and the plan approved domestic relations order does not otherwise provide for the disposition of the alternate payee's interest the plan shall pay the alternate payee's portion to the personal representative of the deceased alternate payee pursuant to this subsection.  The personal representative is responsible for maintaining a current mailing address on file with the plan.  The plan has no duty to attempt to locate any personal representative.  The plan is not responsible for making benefit payments to a personal representative until the personal representative has both:

1. Persuaded the plan that the personal representative is authorized to receive payments designated for the deceased alternate payee.

2. Provided the plan with an address to which the payments should be sent.

H. If, within thirty days after the date the plan verifies an alternate payee's death, a personal representative does not make demand on the plan for the alternate payee's portion, the plan shall either:

1. Hold the alternate payee's portion until the time a personal representative makes a proper demand for payment of the alternate payee's portion.

2. Remit the alternate payee's portion to the participant, who shall hold the amounts in trust for the estate of the alternate payee until the personal representative is identified.  At that time the participant shall pay the alternate payee's portion paid by the plan to the participant to the personal representative.

Thereafter, the plan shall prospectively pay the alternate payee's portion to the personal representative.

I. Amounts held or paid pursuant to this section shall not accrue interest unless otherwise prescribed by this article.

J. The plan is not liable to the participant, the alternate payee, any personal representative of the estate of an alternate payee or any other person for any amount paid, withheld or disbursed by the plan pursuant to this section.  If one or more payments are made by the plan to a person not otherwise entitled to receive the payments, the recipient of the payment is designated a constructive trustee for the payment received and, together with the marital community, if any, is the sole party against whom an action may be brought to recover the payment.

K. The plan may adopt policies and procedures that govern the implementation of this section.

 

#### Section 38-823. Discount rate; service purchase; transfer of service credits

A. Beginning July 1, 2017, the discount rate specified in subsection B of this section applies to service purchases or transfers of service credits to the plan pursuant to the following sections:

1. Section 38-816, subsection C.

2. Section 38-820, subsection A or B.

3. Section 38-821.

4. Sections 38-921, 38-922, 38-923 and 38-924.

B. The discount rate is an amount equal to the assumed rate of return that is prescribed by the board.

B. The purpose of this article is to provide a defined contribution system that is fully funded on a current basis from employer and member contributions.

C. The legislature intends that the defined contribution system for members under this article be designed to be a qualified government plan under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code, as amended, or successor provisions of law, and be exempt from taxation under section 501 of the internal revenue code. The board may adopt any additional provisions to the defined contribution system that are necessary to fulfill this intent.

#### Section 38-840.05. Contribution rate

A. Employer contributions shall be a percentage of gross compensation for each member, as the system actuary determines pursuant to this section.

The total employer contributions shall be equal to the employer normal cost plus the amount required to amortize the past service funding requirement over a period consistent with generally accepted actuarial standards.

B. All contributions made by the employer and allocated to the EODC disability program trust fund established by section 38-840.02 are irrevocable and shall be used as benefits under this article or to pay expenses of the EODC disability program.

A. In determining eligibility for and continuation of a disability benefit and computing the amount available to a member, the board shall follow the same procedures and methods as prescribed in section 38-806, except that an elected official who no longer holds office must apply within one year after terminating office and the credited service used to compute the benefit shall be only the time earned while a member of the elected officials' defined contribution retirement system established pursuant to article 3.1 of this chapter. Payment of the disability benefit will be made retroactive only to the date the board receives an application for the disability.

B. A member who meets the requirements for a disability pension as prescribed in section 38-806 shall receive a monthly disability benefit equal to a monthly disability pension that would be provided to a member who was elected, appointed or hired on or after January 1, 2012 and before January 1, 2014, reduced by an amount equal to the monthly annuitized value of the member's annuity account under article 3.1 of this chapter that does not include a cost-of-living adjustment, as determined by the board. In determining the monthly annuitized offset value of the member's annuity account under article 3.1 of this chapter to be used in reducing the disability benefit paid pursuant to this subsection, the board shall instruct the actuary for the elected officials' retirement plan to calculate the monthly payment that would be paid to the member assuming the member had elected a straight life annuity commencing on the member's date of disability, using the mortality and interest factors then used by the actuary in determining the valuation of the elected officials' retirement plan.

If any change or error in the records results in any member receiving from the EODC disability program more or less than the member would have been entitled to receive if the records had been correct, the board shall correct the error and shall adjust the payments in a manner so that the equivalent of the benefit to which the member was correctly entitled is paid. The board shall correct any change or error and shall pay the appropriate monies to a member or shall recover monies from the member if the member was overpaid.  The board shall recover monies by reducing any benefit that is otherwise payable by the EODC disability program to a member with a disability.

### Article 4 - Public Safety Personnel Retirement System

#### Section 38-841. Purpose; vested benefits

A. Before the establishment of the public safety personnel retirement system, municipal firemen and policemen, employees of the Arizona highway patrol and other public safety personnel in the state of Arizona were covered under various local, municipal and state retirement programs. These heterogeneous programs provided for wide and significant differentials in employee contribution rates, benefit eligibility provisions, types of benefit protection and benefit formulas.

B. In order to provide a uniform, consistent and equitable statewide program for public safety personnel who are regularly assigned hazardous duty in the employ of the state of Arizona or a political subdivision thereof, this retirement system was created effective as of July 1, 1968, as an amendment to and continuation of three prior systems.  Groups of employees covered under the three prior systems as of June 30, 1968, and the assets and liabilities accumulated thereunder for such employees, are transferred with prior service credits to this retirement system as of the effective date, and both they and their employers shall be required to make stipulated contributions to support the system's benefit structure on a sound actuarial basis. Future employees in such groups shall commence participation in, and contributions to, the system immediately on commencement of covered employment.

C. The provisions of this system shall not be construed to authorize the granting of any retirement benefits to persons who are retired as of the effective date of this article, except as described in sections 38-849 and 38-853.

D. Additional eligible groups of public safety personnel will participate in the system pursuant to election by their employer for such coverage under an appropriate joinder agreement.

E. The public safety personnel retirement system is a jural entity that may sue and be sued.

If such employee is subsequently covered by the federal old age and survivors insurance system, the employee and the employer may not make any contributions on the employee's behalf to the public safety personnel defined contribution retirement plan established pursuant to article 4.1 of this chapter that are described in section 38-867, subsection A, paragraph 1 or subsection B during the period the employee is covered by the federal old age and survivors insurance system.  If at any later time the employee is not covered by the federal old age and survivors insurance system through an employer under the system, the employee and the employer shall again be required to contribute on behalf of the employee to the public safety personnel defined contribution retirement plan established pursuant to article 4.1 of this chapter as required by section 38-867, subsection A, paragraph 1 and, if the employee made an irrevocable election to contribute more of the employee's gross pensionable compensation to the public safety personnel defined contribution retirement plan as provided in section 38-867, subsection B, such contributions shall be reestablished for the period the employee is not covered by the federal old age and survivors insurance system.

C. If an employee in the employee's first ninety days of employment is determined to be eligible for an accidental or catastrophic disability pension pursuant to section 38-844, the employee shall be automatically enrolled in the system for the remainder of the employee's employment with any employer under the system commencing on the employee's date of disability and shall receive an accidental or catastrophic disability pension as prescribed in this article.

D. If an employee in the employee's first ninety days of employment is killed in the line of duty or dies from injuries suffered in the line of duty, the employee shall be considered as having been enrolled in the system and the surviving spouse of the deceased employee is eligible for survivor benefits as prescribed in this article.

#### Section 38-842.02. Public safety employer risk pool

A. The public safety employer risk pool is established for members hired on or after July 1, 2017 and consists of, for actuarial purposes in the system and to determine contribution rates pursuant to section 38-843, any employer of an eligible group that has on May 1, 2017 two hundred fifty or fewer active members who were hired before July 1, 2017.

B. If an employer has more than two hundred fifty active members who were hired before July 1, 2017 in any eligible group on May 1, 2017, the employer may not participate in the risk pool for any of the employer's eligible groups, except that:

1. Each state agency's eligibility for the risk pool is not affected by another state agency's ineligibility for the risk pool.

2. For a county with multiple eligible groups in the system, the eligibility of each eligible group of a county for the risk pool is not affected by the ineligibility for the risk pool of another eligible group of that county.

C. Any Indian tribe that has elected to participate in the system and that qualifies for the public safety employer risk pool pursuant to subsection A of this section may elect to opt out of the risk pool before January 1, 2019.  The Indian tribe shall notify the administrator of the system in writing before January 1, 2019 of the Indian tribe's decision not to participate in the public safety employer risk pool. If an Indian tribe is a new employer in the system pursuant to subsection D of this section, the Indian tribe shall have ninety days after the date of participation to elect to opt out of the risk pool and to notify the administrator of the system in writing of the Indian tribe's decision not to participate in the public safety employer risk pool.

D. This state or any political subdivision of this state, Indian tribe or public organization that becomes a new employer in the system and that has two hundred fifty or fewer employees, on the effective date of participation in the system pursuant to section 38-851, who are in an eligible group shall participate in the public safety employer risk pool unless subsection B or C of this section applies.

E. If any individual employer in the public safety employer risk pool experiences a deviation in reported active member payroll of greater than twenty percent of the average of all participating employers in the risk pool in a twenty-four-month period, the system actuary shall prepare a financial impact report to determine whether the deviation creates an increased or decreased unfunded liability within the risk pool. If the deviation in reported active member payroll creates an increase to the unfunded liability within the risk pool, the responsible individual employer shall pay into the system, within sixty days after being notified of the amount due, one hundred percent of the cost of the increase in the unfunded liability. If the deviation in reported active member payroll creates a decrease to the unfunded liability within the risk pool, the system shall immediately credit the responsible individual employer one hundred percent of the cost of the decrease in the unfunded liability.

#### Section 38-843. Contributions; employer account asset transfers

A. Each employer who participates in the system on behalf of a group of employees who were covered under a prior public retirement system, other than the federal social security act, shall transfer all securities and monies attributable to the taxes and contributions of the state other than the state contribution to social security, the employer and the employees for the covered group of employees under the other system, such transfer to be made to the fund subject to all existing liabilities and on or within sixty days following the employer's effective date.  All monies and securities transferred to the fund shall be credited to the employer's account in the fund.  A record of the market value and the cost value of such transferred contributions shall be maintained for actuarial and investment purposes.

B. As determined by actuarial valuations reported to the employer and the local board by the board of trustees, each employer shall make contributions sufficient under such actuarial valuations to meet both the normal cost for members hired before July 1, 2017 plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the unfunded accrued liability on a level percent of compensation basis for all employees of the employer who are members of the system or participants as defined in section 38-865, paragraph 7, subdivision (a), item (i) over, beginning July 1, 2017, a closed period of not more than twenty years, except as provided in subsection L of this section, that is established by the board of trustees taking into account the recommendation of the system's actuary. An employer shall have the option of paying a higher level percent of compensation thereby reducing its unfunded past service liability. An employer shall also have the option of increasing its contributions in order to reduce the contributions required from its members under subsection C of this section, except that if an employer elects this option the employer shall pay the same higher level percentage contribution for all members of the eligible group. A county employer that elected to pay a higher level percentage contribution rate may eliminate that higher level percentage contribution rate amount for members who are hired on or after January 1, 2015. During a period when an employee is on industrial leave and the employee elects to continue contributions during the period of industrial leave, the employer shall make the contributions based on the compensation the employee would have received in the employee's job classification if the employee was in normal employment status. All contributions made by the employers and all state taxes allocated to the fund shall be irrevocable and shall be used to pay benefits under the system or to pay expenses of the system and fund. The minimum employer contribution that is paid and that is in excess of the normal cost plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the unfunded accrued liability as calculated pursuant to this subsection shall be used to reduce future employer contribution increases and shall not be used to pay for an increase in benefits that are otherwise payable to members. The board shall separately account for these monies in the fund.  Forfeitures arising because of severance of employment before a member becomes eligible for a pension or any other reason shall be applied to reduce the cost of the employer, not to increase the benefits otherwise payable to members.  After the close of any fiscal year, if the system's actuary determines that the actuarial valuation of an employer's account contains excess valuation assets other than excess valuation assets that were in the employer's account as of fiscal year 2004-2005 and is more than one hundred percent funded, the board shall account for the excess valuation assets up to one hundred percent of present value of all future benefits of the employer in a stabilization reserve account.  After the close of any fiscal year, if the system's actuary determines that the actuarial valuation of an employer's account has a valuation asset deficiency and an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, the board shall use any valuation assets in the stabilization reserve account for that employer, to the extent available, to limit the decline in that employer's funding ratio to not more than two percent.

C. Each member who was hired before July 1, 2017, throughout the member's period of service from the member's effective date of participation, shall contribute to the fund an amount equal to the amount prescribed in subsection E of this section, except as provided in subsection B of this section.  Each member who was hired on or after July 1, 2017, throughout the member's period of service from the member's effective date of participation, shall contribute to the fund an amount equal to the amount prescribed in subsection G of this section. During a period when an employee is on industrial leave and the employee elects to continue contributions during the period of industrial leave, the employee shall make the employee's contribution based on the compensation the employee would have received in the employee's job classification if the employee was in normal employment status. Contributions of members shall be required as a condition of employment and membership in the system and shall be made by payroll deductions. Every employee shall be deemed to consent to such deductions.  Payment of an employee's compensation, less such payroll deductions, shall constitute a full and complete discharge and satisfaction of all claims and demands by the employee relating to remuneration for the employee's services rendered during the period covered by the payment, except with respect to the benefits provided under the system. A member may not, under any circumstance, borrow from, take a loan against or remove contributions from the member's account before the termination of membership in the plan or the receipt of a pension.

D. Each employer shall transfer to the board the employer and employee contributions provided for in subsections B, C and G of this section within ten working days after each payroll date.  Contributions transferred after that date shall include a penalty of ten percent per annum, compounded annually, for each day the contributions are late, such penalty to be paid by the employer. Delinquent payments due under this subsection, together with interest charges as provided in this subsection, may be recovered by action in a court of competent jurisdiction against an employer liable for the payments or, at the request of the board, may be deducted from any other monies, including excise revenue taxes, payable to such employer by any department or agency of this state.

E. The amount contributed by a member who was hired before July 1, 2017 pursuant to subsection C of this section is:

1. Through June 30, 2011, 7.65 percent of the member's compensation.

2. For fiscal year 2011-2012, 8.65 percent of the member's compensation.

3. For fiscal year 2012-2013, 9.55 percent of the member's compensation.

4. For fiscal year 2013-2014, 10.35 percent of the member's compensation.

5. For fiscal year 2014-2015, 11.05 percent of the member's compensation.

6. For fiscal year 2015-2016 and each fiscal year thereafter, 11.65 percent of the member's compensation or 33.3 percent of the sum of the member's contribution rate from the preceding fiscal year and the aggregate computed employer contribution rate that is calculated pursuant to subsection B of this section, whichever is lower, except that the member contribution rate shall not be less than 7.65 percent of the member's compensation and the employer contribution rate shall not be less than the rate prescribed in subsection B of this section.

F. The amount of the member's contribution that exceeds 7.65 percent of the member's compensation shall not be used to reduce the employer's contributions that are calculated pursuant to subsection B of this section until the employer's funded ratio as expressed as a percentage of the employer's actuarial value of assets to accrued actuarial liability as determined by actuarial valuations reported pursuant to subsection B of this section is at or above one hundred percent.  If the employer's funded ratio falls below one hundred percent funded, the amount of the member's contributions above 7.65 percent as provided in subsection E, paragraph 6 of this section shall accumulate from that time and not be used to reduce the employer's contribution rate until the employer's funded ratio returns to one hundred percent funded.

G. For members hired on or after July 1, 2017, the employer and member contributions are determined as follows:

1. For employers and members in the public safety employer risk pool:

(a) As determined by the system consolidated actuarial valuation reported to the board of trustees, each employer shall make contributions sufficient under such actuarial valuation to pay fifty percent of both the normal cost plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the total unfunded accrued liability within the risk pool for all employers attributable to all members in the risk pool.  For each year that new unfunded liabilities are attributable to the public safety employer risk pool, a new amortization base representing the most recent annual gain or loss, smoothed over a period of not more than five years as determined by the board, shall be created on a level-dollar basis over a closed period equal to the average expected remaining service lives of all members of the risk pool but not more than ten years, as determined by the board.

(b) The remaining fifty percent of both the normal cost and actuarially determined amount required to amortize the total unfunded accrued liability within the public safety employer risk pool as determined in subdivision (a) of this paragraph shall be divided by the total number of members in the risk pool such that each member contributes an equal percentage of the member's compensation.  Member contributions shall begin simultaneously with membership in the system and shall be made by payroll deduction.

2. For employers and members that are not in the public safety employer risk pool:

(a) As determined by actuarial valuations reported to the employer and the local board by the board of trustees, each employer shall make contributions sufficient under such actuarial valuations to pay fifty percent of both the normal cost plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the total unfunded accrued liability for each employer attributable only to those members hired on or after July 1, 2017. For each year that new unfunded liabilities are attributable to the employer's own members hired on or after July 1, 2017, a new amortization base representing the most recent annual gain or loss, smoothed over a period of not more than five years as determined by the board, shall be created on a level-dollar basis over a closed period equal to the average expected remaining service lives of all members but not more than ten years, as determined by the board.

(b) The remaining fifty percent of both the normal cost and actuarially determined amount required to amortize the total unfunded accrued liability as determined pursuant to subdivision (a) of this paragraph shall be divided by the total number of the employer's members who were hired on or after July 1, 2017 such that each member contributes an equal percentage of the member's compensation.  Member contributions shall begin simultaneously with membership in the system and shall be made by payroll deduction.

H. In any fiscal year, an employer's contribution to the system in combination with member contributions may not be less than the actuarially determined normal cost for that fiscal year. The board may not suspend contributions to the system unless both of the following apply:

1. The retirement system actuary, based on the annual valuation, determines the stabilization reserve of an employer's account is funded to one hundred percent of present value of all future benefits of the employer.

2. The board determines that suspending, in whole or in part, the normal cost contributions as calculated under subsection B of this section would not be in conflict with its fiduciary responsibility.

I. An employer may request that the board transfer excess assets of an employer's account that has no liabilities or beneficiaries to another account of the employer that is managed by the board. The board may authorize the transfer of assets if all of the following apply:

1. The board verifies that the employer's liabilities have been reconciled with the administrator and there are no remaining or potential liabilities or beneficiaries of the employer's account.

2. The board and the system bear no liability that the proposed transfer conforms with any other restrictions on the use or transfer of the assets of the proposed transfer.

3. The transfer does not violate the internal revenue code or threaten to impair the system's status as a qualified plan under the internal revenue code.

J. For the purposes of requesting a transfer of assets pursuant to this section, an employer must meet both of the following requirements:

1. The governing body of the employer adopts a resolution requesting the transfer of assets in an open session where public comment is allowed.

2. The employer submits a written request to the administrator of the board for the transfer of assets along with the adopted resolution.

K. For a state employer that meets the requirements of subsection I of this section, the joint legislative budget committee may request from the administrator of the board confirmation that an employer's account meets the requirements to transfer the account assets.  The legislature shall pass a bill directing the board to transfer the assets from the eligible employer account to another account of the employer.  Before the legislature passes the bill, the joint legislative budget committee shall confirm with the administrator of the board that the assets are eligible for transfer to another employer account and discuss the matter in a scheduled public meeting.

L. For the purposes of calculating unfunded liability amortization payments pursuant to subsection B of this section, an employer may make a onetime election to request that the board use a closed period of not more than thirty years if the employer meets both of the following requirements:

1. The governing body of the employer adopts a resolution requesting the longer amortization period and specifying the actuarial valuation date for which the new amortization period is to begin. The actuarial valuation date chosen must be the system's fiscal year end either immediately before or immediately after the date of the resolution.

2. The employer submits a written request for the longer amortization period along with the adopted resolution to the administrator of the board.

M. For the purposes of subsection L of this section, employer does not include this state or any state agency.

N. If a member's employment is terminated with an employer by either party, the total liability under the system associated with the member's service with the employer remains with the employer.

#### Section 38-843.01. Internal revenue code section 414(h) pickup of member contributions

Each employer shall pick up the contributions required of members on account of compensation paid after the effective date specified in the resolution of the board activating the provisions of this section.  The picked up contributions shall be treated as employer contributions for the purpose of tax treatment under the United States internal revenue code. The specified effective date shall not be before the date the system receives notification from the internal revenue service that pursuant to section 414(h) of the internal revenue code the member contributions picked up shall not be included in gross income for income tax purposes until the time that the picked up contributions are distributed by refund or pension payments.  The employers shall pick up the member contributions from monies established and available in a retirement deduction account, which monies would otherwise have been designated as member contributions and paid to the system. Member contributions picked up pursuant to this section shall be treated for all other purposes, in the same manner and to the same extent, as member contributions made before the effective date.

 

#### Section 38-843.02. Internal revenue code qualification

The legislature intends that the system is a qualified pension plan under section 401 of the internal revenue code, as amended, or successor provisions of law, and that the trust is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the internal revenue code, as amended.  The assets of the fund are held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the system.  The board may adopt such additional provisions to the system as are necessary to fulfill this intent.

 

#### Section 38-843.03. Statutory construction

Because the system as enacted at a particular time is a unique amalgam of rights and obligations having a critical impact on the actuarial integrity of the system, the legislature intends that the system as enacted at a particular time be construed and applied as a coherent whole and without reference to any other provision of the system in effect at a different time.

#### Section 38-843.04. Compensation limitation; adjustments; definition

A. The annual compensation of each member taken into account for purposes of the system shall not exceed the following:

1. Beginning January 1, 1996 through December 31, 2001, $150,000.

2. Except for members who are hired on or after July 1, 2017, beginning January 1, 2002, $200,000. The board shall adjust the $200,000 annual compensation limit under this paragraph at the same time and in the same manner as adjusted by the United States secretary of the treasury under section 401(a)(17)(B) of the internal revenue code.  The adjustment under this paragraph for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for that calendar year.

3. For members who are hired on or after July 1, 2017, $110,000.  The board shall adjust the $110,000 annual compensation limit under this paragraph as prescribed in subsection C of this section. Notwithstanding the adjustments made under subsection C of this section, the limit under this paragraph, as adjusted by the board, may not exceed the maximum compensation limit of section 401(a)(17) of the internal revenue code, as adjusted by the United States secretary of the treasury.

B. If compensation under the system is determined on a period of time that contains fewer than twelve calendar months, the compensation limit for that period of time is equal to the dollar limit for the calendar year during which the period of time begins, multiplied by the fraction in which the numerator is the number of full months in that period of time and the denominator is twelve.

C. Beginning in fiscal year 2020-2021, and every third fiscal year thereafter, the board shall adjust the annual compensation limit specified in subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section by the average change in the public safety wage index as determined in this subsection.  The board shall annually publish the public safety wage index in January. The annual compensation limit adjustment under this subsection for a calendar year applies to the annual compensation for that calendar year. To determine the public safety wage index:

1. Employers represented in the public safety wage index shall provide the board pay scales for the month of July for the enforcement classifications of public safety officers annually in July.

2. The board shall determine the weighted average of the change in the top of the pay scale for public safety officers of the employers represented in the public safety wage index.  The average change shall be weighted by measuring each employer's total number of members divided by the total number of members of all employers represented in the public safety wage index.

D. The board shall establish a public safety wage index that is composed of a group of employers that represents geographic diversity across this state and that represents:

1. Seven large employers, each of which has one thousand or more total system members, composed of one state law enforcement agency, one county law enforcement agency, three municipal law enforcement agencies and two municipal fire agencies.

2. Nine midsized employers, each of which has more than two hundred but fewer than one thousand total system members, composed of one state law enforcement agency, two county law enforcement agencies, four municipal law enforcement agencies, one municipal fire agency and one fire district.

3. Ten small employers, each of which has two hundred or fewer total system members, composed of three municipal law enforcement agencies, four municipal fire agencies and three fire districts.

E. The board may not change the employers represented in the public safety wage index more frequently than every ten years, unless required to maintain the composition of employers as prescribed in subsection D of this section.

F. For the purposes of this section, "public safety officers" means the classification of police officers, sheriff's deputies, firefighters or wildlife managers or their equivalent enforcement classifications.

#### Section 38-843.05. Retired members; return to work; employer contributions

A. An employer shall pay contributions at an alternate contribution rate on behalf of a retired member who returns to work in any capacity in a position ordinarily filled by an employee of the employer of an eligible group, unless the retired member is required to participate in another state retirement system and the retired member returned to work before July 20, 2011. For the purposes of this subsection, "returns to work in any capacity" includes a retired member who returns to work and is ineligible for benefits pursuant to section 38-849, subsection E.

B. The alternate contribution rate shall be equal to that portion of the individual employer's total required contribution that is applied to the amortization of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability for the fiscal year beginning July 1, based on the system's actuary's calculation of the total required contribution for the preceding fiscal year ended on June 30.  The alternate contribution rate shall be applied to the compensation, gross salary or contract fee of a retired member who meets the requirements of this section.

C. The alternate contribution rate shall not be less than eight percent in any fiscal year.

D. All contributions made by the employer and allocated to the fund are irrevocable and shall be used as benefits under this article or to pay the expenses of the system.  Payments made pursuant to this section by employers become delinquent after the due date prescribed in section 38-843, subsection D, and thereafter shall be increased by interest from and after that date until payment is received by the system.

E. An employer of a retired member shall immediately notify the local board after the employment of a retired member and shall submit any reports, data, paperwork or materials that are requested by the board or the local board that are necessary to determine the compensation, gross salary or contract fee associated with a retired member who returns to work or to determine the function, use, efficacy or operation of the return to work program.

 

#### Section 38-843.06. Required distributions

All distributions required under this article shall be determined and made pursuant to section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section by the United States secretary of the treasury.

 

#### Section 38-843.07. Adjustment and refund; termination of the system

A. If more than the correct amount of employer or member contributions is paid into the system by an employer through a mistake of fact, the board shall return those contributions to the employer if the employer requests return of the contributions within one year after the date of the overpayment. The board may not pay an employer earnings attributable to excess contributions but shall reduce the amount returned to an employer pursuant to this subsection by the amount of losses attributable to the excess contributions.

B. On termination or partial termination of the system, the accrued benefit of each member is, as of the date of termination or partial termination, fully vested and nonforfeitable to the extent then funded.

 

#### Section 38-844. Requirements for retirement benefits and disability pensions

A. A member shall be eligible for a normal pension on retirement on or after the member's normal retirement date.  Payment of a normal pension shall commence as of the first day of the month following the date of retirement, and the last payment shall be made as of the last day of the month in which the death of the retired member occurs.

B. A member is eligible for an accidental disability pension if the member's employment is terminated by reason of accidental disability. A member is eligible for an ordinary disability pension if the member's employment is terminated before the member's normal retirement date by reason of ordinary disability. A member shall file an application for a disability pension after the disabling incident or within one year after the date the member ceases to be an employee. Timely application for an accidental, catastrophic or ordinary disability pension is a prerequisite to receipt of the pension. Payment of an accidental, catastrophic or ordinary disability pension shall commence as of the first day of the month following the date of retirement or the expiration of a period during which the member is receiving sick leave payments or a temporary disability pension, whichever is later, but not earlier than section 38-845.02 allows for retroactive payments.  The last payment shall be made as of the last day of the month in which the death of the retired member occurs, or if disability ceases before the member's normal retirement date, the first day of the month in which disability ceases.

C. A member is eligible for a catastrophic disability pension if the member's employment is terminated by reason of catastrophic disability.  If more than the allowable catastrophic disability pensions are approved by the local boards in a calendar year, from and after December 31 of the following calendar year a member of the system is not eligible to apply for a catastrophic disability pension. On or before January 31, the board of trustees shall report to the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives the number of catastrophic disability pensions that were approved by the local boards in the preceding calendar year. For the purposes of this subsection, "allowable catastrophic disability pensions" means for calendar year 2004, ten, and for subsequent calendar years the number of allowable catastrophic disability pensions allowed in the prior calendar year minus the number of catastrophic disability pensions approved by the local boards in the prior calendar year plus four.

D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, no member shall qualify for an accidental, catastrophic or ordinary disability pension if the local board determines that the member's disability results from the following:

1. An injury suffered while engaged in a felonious criminal act or enterprise.

2. Service in the armed forces of the United States that entitles the member to a veteran's disability pension.

3. A physical or mental condition or injury that existed or occurred before the member's date of membership in the system.

E. Accidental or ordinary disability shall be considered to have ceased and an accidental or ordinary disability pension terminates if the member:

1. Has sufficiently recovered, in the opinion of the local board, based on a medical examination by a designated physician or a physician working in a clinic that is appointed by the local board, to be able to engage in a reasonable range of duties within the member's department and the member refuses an offer of employment by an employer in the system.

2. Refuses to undergo any medical examination requested by the local board, provided that a medical examination shall not be required more frequently than once in any calendar year.

F. Sixty months after the award of a catastrophic disability pension, the local board shall reevaluate the member.  If the member still qualifies for the catastrophic disability pension, the member is entitled to continue to receive the pension at the reduced amount prescribed in section 38-845, subsection E. A catastrophic disability shall be considered to have ceased and a catastrophic disability pension terminates if the local board determines that the member has sufficiently recovered and is able to engage in gainful employment based on a medical examination by a designated physician or a physician working in a clinic that is appointed by the local board. After the sixty-month review, the catastrophic disability shall be considered to have ceased and a catastrophic disability pension terminates if the local board determines that the member has sufficiently recovered and is able to engage in gainful employment based on a medical examination by a designated physician or a physician working in a clinic that is appointed by the local board, except that the medical examination shall not be required more frequently than once in a calendar year. The medical review after the sixty-month period does not apply after the date the catastrophic disability pensioner would have attained twenty-five years of service assuming the pensioner remained a member of the system. The local board shall also terminate a catastrophic disability pension if the member refuses to undergo any medical examination requested by the local board. A member whose catastrophic disability pension is terminated may apply for and if eligible is entitled to receive an accidental disability pension as provided in this section.

G. Subsection E of this section does not apply after a disability pensioner's normal retirement date.  The amount of a disability pension shall not be recomputed at a disability pensioner's normal retirement date.

H. If accidental or ordinary disability ceases before a retired member attains the member's normal retirement date and the member is reemployed by an employer, the member shall be treated as if the member has been on an uncompensated leave of absence during the period of the member's disability retirement and shall be a contributing member of the system.  The pension payable on the member's subsequent retirement shall be determined as provided in section 38-845.

I. A member shall be eligible for a temporary disability pension if the member's employment is terminated before the member's normal retirement date by reason of temporary disability. Payment of a temporary disability pension shall commence as of the first day of the month following the date of disability or the expiration of a period during which the member is receiving compensation and sick leave payments, whichever is later. The last payment shall be made as of the first day of the month in which either the death of the member occurs or the local board deems the member is no longer under temporary disability, whichever first occurs, provided that not more than twelve monthly temporary disability payments shall be made in total to the member.

J. If on the expiration of a temporary disability pension the local board finds on application that the member has an accidental or ordinary disability, the member shall be eligible for an accidental or ordinary disability pension, as provided in this section.

K. The system shall make payments pursuant to section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section. Notwithstanding any other provision of the system, beginning January 1, 1987 payment of benefits to a member shall commence not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of:

1. The calendar year in which the member attains seventy-two years of age.

2. The date the member terminates employment.

#### Section 38-844.01. Vested rights to benefits

A member of the system does not have vested rights to benefits under the system, except as provided in section 38-854, until he files an application for benefits and is found eligible for those benefits as provided in this article. An eligible claimant's rights to benefits vest on the date of his application for those benefits or his last day of employment under the system, whichever occurs first.

#### Section 38-844.02. Deferred retirement option plan for employees hired before January 1, 2012; purpose

A. A deferred retirement option plan is established for those employees who become members of the system before January 1, 2012.  The purpose of the deferred retirement option plan is to add flexibility to the system and to provide members who elect to participate in the deferred retirement option plan access to a lump sum benefit in addition to their normal monthly retirement benefit on actual retirement.

B. The board shall offer the deferred retirement option plan to members on a voluntary basis as an alternative method of benefit accrual under the system.

#### Section 38-846. Death benefits

A. The surviving spouse of a deceased retired member shall be paid a surviving spouse's pension if the spouse was married to the member for a period of at least two consecutive years at the time of the member's death.  Payment of a surviving spouse's pension shall commence as of the last day of the month following the retired member's date of death. The last payment shall be made as of the last day of the month in which the surviving spouse's death occurs.

B. The surviving spouse of a deceased member shall be paid a surviving spouse's pension if the spouse was married to the member on the date of the member's death.  Payment of a surviving spouse's pension commences as of the last day of the month following the member's date of death.  The last payment shall be made as of the last day of the month in which the surviving spouse's death occurs.

C. The surviving spouse of a deceased retired member is entitled to receive a monthly amount equal to four-fifths of the monthly amount of pension that the decedent would have received immediately before death.

D. The surviving spouse of a deceased member who was not killed in the line of duty or did not die from injuries suffered in the line of duty is entitled to receive a monthly amount calculated in the same manner as an accidental disability pension is calculated pursuant to section 38-845, subsection B.  The surviving spouse of a deceased member who is killed in the line of duty or dies from injuries suffered in the line of duty is entitled to receive a monthly amount equal to the deceased member's average monthly benefit compensation less any amount payable for an eligible child under this section. A member who was eligible for or receiving a temporary disability pension at the time of the member's death is not deemed to be retired for the purposes of this subsection.  For the purposes of this subsection, "killed in the line of duty" means the decedent's death was the direct and proximate result of the performance of the decedent's public safety duties and does not include suicide.  For actuarial valuation purposes, the actuarial present value of the amount computed under this subsection for a surviving spouse of a deceased member who is killed in the line of duty or who dies from injuries suffered in the line of duty, plus any amount payable for an eligible child under this section, shall be deposited directly into the employer account and charged against the investment earnings of the fund before those earnings are distributed to each employer.

E. A surviving spouse shall file a written application with the system in order to receive a survivor benefit.

F. If at least one eligible child is surviving at the death of a member or retired member, but no surviving spouse's pension then becomes payable, a guardian's or conservator's pension shall be payable to the person who is serving, or who is deemed by the local board to be serving, as the legally appointed guardian or custodian of the eligible child.  If an eligible child of a member or retired member is surviving at the member's or retired member's death, the eligible child is entitled to receive a child's pension payable to the person who is serving or who is deemed by the local board to be serving as the legally appointed guardian or custodian of the eligible child until the eligible child reaches eighteen years of age, at which time the eligible child's pension shall be paid directly to the eligible child if the person remains eligible to receive the pension and is not subject to a guardianship or conservatorship due to disability or incapacity.  The pension of a child with a disability who is eighteen years of age or older and who is subject to a guardianship or conservatorship due to disability or incapacity shall continue to be paid to the guardian or conservator if the child remains eligible for the pension payment.  A child's pension or a guardian's or conservator's pension terminates if the child is adopted.  In the case of a child with a disability, the child's pension or the guardian's or conservator's pension terminates if the child ceases to be under a disability or ceases to be a dependent of the surviving spouse or guardian.  The member may also direct by designation to the local board that the guardian or conservator pension or child's pension be paid to the trustee of a trust created for the benefit of the eligible child.  A guardian's or conservator's pension shall also become payable if at least one eligible child is surviving when a surviving spouse's pension terminates. The guardian or conservator shall file a written application with the system in order to receive the guardian's or conservator's pension and child's pension.

G. The board shall pay a guardian's or conservator's pension during the same period in which a pension is payable to at least one eligible child. The guardian, conservator or designated trustee is entitled to receive the same monthly amount as would have been payable to the decedent's surviving spouse had a surviving spouse's pension become payable on the decedent's death.

H. Each eligible child is entitled to a monthly amount equal to one-tenth of the monthly amount of pension that the deceased member or retired member would have received immediately before death.  The pension for a child of a deceased member shall be calculated in the same manner as an accidental disability is calculated pursuant to section 38-845, subsection B. A deceased member shall be assumed to be retired for reasons of accidental disability immediately before the member's death.  If there are three or more children eligible for a child's pension, a maximum of two shares of the child's pension shall be payable, the aggregate of such shares to be apportioned in equal measure to each eligible child.

I. If a member has accumulated contributions remaining in the system at the date of death of the last beneficiary, a lump sum refund of such accumulated contributions shall be payable to the person whom the member has designated to the local board as the member's refund beneficiary, or if the member's refund beneficiary is not then surviving, to the designated contingent refund beneficiary, or if the designated contingent refund beneficiary is not then surviving or if the surviving designated beneficiary does not apply for the benefit within twelve months from the date of the member's death, at the election of the local board to the person's nearest of kin as determined by the local board or to the estate of the deceased member. The amount of the lump sum refund shall be the remaining accumulated contributions.  The beneficiary or person who is claiming to be the nearest of kin shall file a written application in order to receive the refund.

J. In calculating the right to and the amount of the surviving spouse's pension, the law in effect on the date of the death of the member or retired member controls, unless the law under which the member retired provides for a greater benefit amount for a surviving spouse.

#### Section 38-846.01. Deferred annuity; exception

A. If any member who has at least ten years of credited service terminates employment for reasons other than retirement or disability, the member may elect to receive a deferred annuity, except that if the annuitant withdraws all or part of the annuitant's accumulated contributions in the system all rights in and to a deferred annuity shall be forfeited by the annuitant.  A deferred annuity is a lifetime monthly payment actuarially equivalent to the annuitant's accumulated contributions in the system plus an equal amount paid by the employer and shall commence on application on or after the sixty-second birthday of the annuitant.  The annuity is not a retirement benefit and annuitants are not entitled to receive any amount prescribed by section 38-845, subsection F or section 38-846, 38-856.05 or 38-857.

B. This section does not apply to a member who becomes a member of the system on or after January 1, 2012.  For a member who is hired on or after January 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2017, a member who attains a normal retirement date is eligible for retirement and a retirement benefit even if the member terminates employment with an employer before the age requirement for normal retirement if the member attains the service requirement for normal retirement.  For a member who is hired on or after July 1, 2017, a member who attains a normal retirement date is eligible for retirement and a retirement benefit even if the member terminates employment with an employer before the age requirement for normal retirement if the member attains the credited service requirement for normal retirement.  Once a member described in this subsection reaches the normal retirement age, the member may receive payments made under section 38-845.

 

#### Section 38-846.02. Termination of membership

A. On termination of employment for any reason other than death or retirement, within twenty days after filing a completed application with the board, a member who becomes a member of the system before January 1, 2012 is entitled to receive the following amounts, less any benefit payments the member has received or any amount the member may owe to the system:

C. On termination of employment for any reason other than death or retirement, within twenty days after filing a completed application with the board, a member who becomes a member of the system on or after January 1, 2012 is entitled to receive a lump sum payment equal to the member's accumulated contribution plus interest at a rate determined by the board as of the date of termination, less any benefit payments the member has received as of the date of termination or any amount the member may owe to the system.

D. A member who withdraws the amount prescribed in subsection A, B or C of this section from the system or who elects a transfer pursuant to section 38-846.06 forfeits all rights to benefits under the system and rights to rehearing and appeal, except as provided in section 38-849.

#### Section 38-846.03. Reinstatement of surviving spouse's pension

A. A surviving spouse whose pension was terminated by reason of remarriage is entitled to reinstatement of the surviving spouse's pension if the surviving spouse is otherwise qualified for a surviving spouse's pension and applies for reinstatement with the public safety personnel retirement system and no other person is currently receiving a guardian's or conservator's pension for an eligible child of the member or retired member. The level of pension payments shall be that amount which was received by the surviving spouse at the date the surviving spouse's pension was terminated, adjusted to reflect ad hoc and scheduled increases from the date of termination to the date of reinstatement.

B. A surviving spouse who is receiving a guardian's or conservator's pension by reason of remarriage and who is otherwise eligible may apply for reinstatement of a surviving spouse's pension. If the surviving spouse's pension becomes payable the guardian's or conservator's pension is terminated.

C. Reinstated surviving spouse's pensions are not retroactive.  Payment of a reinstated surviving spouse's pension shall commence as of the first day of the month following receipt by the public safety personnel retirement system of a properly executed written application for reinstatement from the surviving spouse.

B. Subsection A of this section does not apply if a court of competent jurisdiction orders reinstatement of benefits and duties under a prior law.

C. If a member was initially employed on or after July 1, 2017, regardless of whether the member received a severance refund or redeposits the amount withdrawn with interest, the member shall return to the system as irrevocably elected pursuant to section 38-842.01.

D. A member who transfers credited service from one employer to another employer pursuant to section 38-853 retains the benefits and duties in effect at the time of the member's transfer.

If a member is convicted of, or discharged because of, theft, embezzlement, fraud or misappropriation of an employer's property or property under the control of the employer, the member shall be subject to restitution and fines imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction.

B. A person who knowingly makes any false statement or who falsifies or allows to be falsified any record of the system with an intent to defraud the system is guilty of a class 5 felony. If any change or error in the records results in any member or beneficiary receiving from the system more or less than the member or beneficiary would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the local board shall correct such error, and as far as practicable shall adjust the payments in such manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which such member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid. If a member is convicted of a crime specified in this subsection, section 13-713 applies.

C. If a member who received a severance refund on termination of employment pursuant to section 38-846.02 becomes reemployed with the same employer within two years after the former member's termination date, the member may have forfeited credited service attributable to service rendered during a prior period of service as an employee restored on satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

1. The member files with the system a written application for reinstatement of forfeited credited service within ninety days after again becoming an employee.

2. The retirement fund is paid the total amount previously withdrawn pursuant to section 38-846.02 plus compound interest from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment.  Interest shall be computed at the rate of nine percent for each year compounded each year from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment.  Forfeited credited service shall not be restored until complete payment is received by the fund.

3. The required payment is completed within one year after returning to employee status.

D. If a member who received a severance refund on termination of employment, as provided in section 38-846.02, is subsequently reemployed by an employer, the member's prior service credits shall be cancelled and service shall be credited only from the date the member's most recent reemployment period commenced. However, a present active member of the system who forfeited credited service, received a severance refund pursuant to section 38-846.02 and becomes reemployed with the same employer two years or more after the member's termination date or becomes reemployed with another employer may elect to redeem any part of that forfeited credited service by paying into the system any amounts required pursuant to this subsection. A present active member who elects to redeem any part of forfeited credited service for which the member is deemed eligible by the board shall pay into the system the amounts previously paid or transferred to the member as a severance refund plus an amount that is computed by the system's actuary that is necessary to equal the increase in the actuarial present value of projected benefits resulting from the redemption calculated using the actuarial methods and assumptions prescribed by the system's actuary. On satisfaction of this obligation, the member's prior service credits shall be reinstated.

E. If a retired member becomes reemployed in any capacity by the employer from which the member retired before six months after the date of retirement or in the same position at any time following retirement:

(d) Any pension payments received by the retired member, who retired on or after July 1, 2009, during the period of reemployment are considered overpayments pursuant to section 38-850, unless subsection B of this section applies. If the board determines in the board's sole discretion, for a member who retired on or after July 1, 2009, that the retired member's reemployment during the six-month period and the failure of the employer or the local board to suspend the member's pension were not intentional to circumvent the requirements of this subsection, the pension payments received by the retired member after the retired member's reemployment are subject to repayment up to only the amount received between the date of the member's reemployment and the expiration of the six-month period.

2. The retired member, who retired on or after July 1, 2009 and who is reemployed terminates employment, may be subsequently reemployed with the employer from which the member retired and resume receiving pension payments after a period of six months, less the period of time the retired member was not reemployed after retirement with the employer from which the member retired, if at least sixty days of the six months are consecutive.

F. If a retired member is assigned voluntary duties acting as a limited authority peace officer, pursuant to the Arizona peace officer standards and training board rules, employee contributions shall not be made on the retired member's account, and any service shall not be credited during the period of reemployment. The employer shall not pay the alternate contribution rate pursuant to section 38-843.05.

G. If after six months after the date of retirement a retired member becomes reemployed by the employer from which the member retired in a position other than the same position from which the member retired, employee contributions shall not be made on the retired member's account, and any service shall not be credited during the period of reemployment. The employer shall pay the alternate contribution rate pursuant to section 38-843.05.

H. At any time following retirement, if the retired member becomes employed by an employer, other than the employer from which the member retired, in a position ordinarily filled by an employee of an eligible group, employee contributions shall not be made on the retired member's account, and any service shall not be credited during the period of reemployment. The employer shall pay the alternate contribution rate pursuant to section 38-843.05.

I. If a member who retired under an accidental or ordinary disability becomes reemployed as an employee of an eligible group, section 38-844 applies and a determination shall be made by the local board as to whether subsection E, F, G or H of this section applies.

A person who defrauds the system or who takes, converts, steals or embezzles monies owned by or from the system and who fails or refuses to return the monies to the system on the board's written request is subject to civil suit by the system in the superior court in Maricopa county. On entry of an order finding the person has defrauded the system or taken, converted, stolen or embezzled monies owned by or from the system, the court shall enter an order against that person and for the system awarding the system all of its costs and expenses of any kind, including attorney fees, that were necessary to successfully prosecute the action. The court shall also grant the system a judicial lien on all of the nonexempt property of the person against whom judgment is entered pursuant to this subsection in an amount equal to all amounts awarded to the system, plus interest at the rate prescribed by section 44-1201, until all amounts owed are paid to the system.

L. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the board may offset against any benefits otherwise payable by the system to an active or retired member or survivor any court ordered amounts awarded to the board and system and assessed against the member or survivor.

M. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a member who retires having met all of the qualifications for retirement and who subsequently becomes an elected official, by election or appointment, is not considered reemployed by the same employer.

N. For the purposes of this section, "same position" means a position in which the member performs substantially similar duties that were performed and exercises substantially similar authority that was exercised by the retired member before retirement.

B. No employee shall have any right to, or interest in, any assets of the fund on termination of his employment or otherwise, except as provided from time to time under the system, and then only to the extent of the benefits payable to such employee out of the assets of the fund. All payments of benefits as provided for in the system shall be made solely out of the assets of the fund, and the employers, the board and any member of the board are not liable for payment of benefits in any manner.

C. Benefits, employee contributions or employer contributions, including interest, earnings and all other credits, payable under this system shall not be subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, charge, garnishment, execution or levy of any kind, either voluntary or involuntary, prior to actually being received by the person entitled to the benefit, contribution, earning or credit, under the terms of the system, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber, charge or otherwise dispose of any such right hereunder shall be void.  The fund shall not in any manner be liable for, or subject to, the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements or torts of any person entitled to such rights hereunder. This subsection does not preclude arrangements for the withholding of taxes from benefit payments, arrangements for the recovery of benefit overpayments, arrangements for the transfer of benefit rights to another plan or arrangements for direct deposit of benefit payments in an account in a bank, savings and loan association or credit union if the arrangement is not part of an arrangement constituting an assignment or alienation.

1. Contributions shall be based on the compensation that the member would have received but for the period that the member was ordered into active military service.

B. For the purpose of determining a disability, the medical board shall be composed of a designated physician or physicians working in a clinic other than the employer's regular employee or contractee. Employees employed after October 1, 1992 shall undergo a medical examination for the purpose of identifying a physical or mental condition or injury that existed or occurred prior to a member's date of membership in the system and for which benefits may otherwise be limited by section 38-844, subsection D, and for this purpose, the medical board shall be composed of a designated physician or physicians working in a clinic that may be the employer's regular employee or contractee.

C. A finding of accidental, ordinary, temporary or catastrophic disability shall be based on medical evidence by a designated physician or a physician working in a clinic that is appointed by the local board pursuant to section 38-847, subsection D, paragraph 9 that established the disability. The local board shall resolve material conflicts in medical evidence. If required, the local board may employ other physicians or clinics to report on special cases.  With the approval of the local board, a designated physician or physicians working in a clinic that is employed by the local board may employ occupational specialists to assist the designated physician or physicians working in a clinic in rendering an opinion.

Medical examinations conducted pursuant to this article shall be conducted by a physician and shall not be conducted or utilized for the purposes of hiring, advancement, discharge, job training or other terms, conditions and privileges of employment unrelated to the receipt of or qualification for pension benefits or service credits under the system.

F. This section does not affect or impair the right of an employer to prescribe medical or physical standards for employees or prospective employees.

 

#### Section 38-860. Domestic relations orders; procedures; payments

A. Notwithstanding any other law, in a judicial proceeding for annulment, dissolution of marriage or legal separation that provides for the distribution of community property, or in any judicial proceeding to amend or enforce such a property distribution, a court in this state may issue a domestic relations order that provides that all or any part of a participant's benefit or refund in the system that would otherwise be payable to that participant shall instead be paid by the system to an alternate payee.

B. A domestic relations order is not effective against the system unless the domestic relations order is approved by the system and qualifies as a plan approved domestic relations order.  To qualify as a plan approved domestic relations order, a domestic relations order shall comply with any policies or procedures adopted pursuant to subsection K and shall also meet all of the following requirements:

1. The domestic relations order shall state the name and the last known mailing address of the participant and the name and last known mailing address of the alternate payee that is covered by the domestic relations order.

2. The domestic relations order shall clearly state the amount or percentage of the participant's benefits that is payable by the system to the alternate payee or the precise manner in which the amount or percentage is to be determined.

3. The domestic relations order shall state the number of payments or periods to which the domestic relations order applies, if applicable.

4. The domestic relations order shall state that the domestic relations order applies to the system.

5. The domestic relations order shall not require the system to provide any type or form of benefit or any option not otherwise provided by this article.

6. The domestic relations order shall not require the system to provide increased benefits determined on the basis of actuarial value.

7. The domestic relations order shall not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee if the benefits are required to be paid to another alternate payee under a separate plan approved domestic relations order.

8. The domestic relations order shall have been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction of a state, territory or possession of the United States.

C. On receipt by the system of a certified copy of a domestic relations order and a written request for a determination that the domestic relations order is a plan approved domestic relations order, the system shall promptly issue a written notice of receipt stating that the domestic relations order and request were received to the participant and alternate payee at the addresses on file, if any.

D. The system has a determination period to issue a written determination indicating whether a domestic relations order qualifies as a plan approved domestic relations order. If the participant is receiving benefits during the determination period, and if the system can determine the amount of the benefits that currently would be payable to the alternate payee if the domestic relations order were a plan approved domestic relations order, the system shall hold the segregated funds and shall pay the remaining portion of the benefits to the participant.  If the system determines the domestic relations order is a plan approved domestic relations order, the system shall pay the participant and alternate payee pursuant to the plan approved domestic relations order in the month following the month in which the determination was issued, or in the month following the month in which a benefit is payable under the plan approved domestic relations order, whichever is later.  If the system determines the domestic relations order fails to qualify as a plan approved domestic relations order, the system shall specify in its determination how the domestic relations order is deficient and how it may be amended to qualify as a plan approved domestic relations order.  If the participant is currently receiving benefits, and if the system can determine the amount of segregated funds that would be payable to the alternate payee if the domestic relations order were a plan approved domestic relations order, the system shall hold the segregated funds during the cure period to allow the parties to submit a certified copy of an amended domestic relations order and a written request for a determination that the amended domestic relations order is a plan approved domestic relations order. During the cure period, the system shall pay the participant's portion to the participant.  At the end of the cure period, if the issue of whether an amended domestic relations order qualifies as a plan approved domestic relations order remains undetermined or if an amended domestic relations order is determined not to be a plan approved domestic relations order, the system shall pay the segregated funds and the participant's portion to the participant.  The participant shall hold the segregated funds in trust for the alternate payee as provided in subsection J. If an amended domestic relations order that is submitted after the expiration of the cure period is determined to be a plan approved domestic relations order, the system shall make payments to an alternate payee under the plan approved domestic relations order only prospectively.  A determination by the system that a domestic relations order is not a plan approved domestic relations order does not prohibit a participant or alternate payee from submitting an amended domestic relations order to the system.

E. Each participant and alternate payee is responsible for maintaining a current mailing address on file with the system. The system has no duty to attempt to locate any participant or alternate payee.  The system has no duty to provide a notice of receipt or determination or pay benefits by means other than mailing the notice or payments to the participant or alternate payee at the last known address that is on file with the system.  If the address of an alternate payee is unknown to the system, but benefits are payable to the alternate payee pursuant to a plan approved domestic relations order, the system shall either:

1. Hold the alternate payee's portion until such a time as the alternate payee provides the system with a current address.  Once the system is notified of the alternate payee's current address, the system shall prospectively pay the alternate payee's portion to the alternate payee.

2. Pay the alternate payee's portion to the participant, who shall hold the alternate payee's portion in trust as provided in subsection J, until such a time as the alternate payee is located.  At that time the participant shall pay the alternate payee's portion directly to the alternate payee.

F. If the address of a participant is unknown to the system, but benefits are payable to the participant pursuant to a plan approved domestic relations order, the system shall hold the participant's portion until the participant provides the system with a current address.

G. If the alternate payee identified in a plan approved domestic relations order predeceases the participant and the plan approved domestic relations order does not otherwise provide for the disposition of the alternate payee's interest the system shall pay the alternate payee's portion to the personal representative of the deceased alternate payee pursuant to this subsection.  The personal representative is responsible for maintaining a current mailing address on file with the system. The system has no duty to attempt to locate any personal representative.  The system is not responsible for making benefit payments to a personal representative until the personal representative has both:

1. Persuaded the system that the personal representative is authorized to receive payments designated for the deceased alternate payee.

2. Provided the system with an address to which the payments should be sent.

H. If, within thirty days after the date the system verifies an alternate payee's death, a personal representative does not make demand on the system for the alternate payee's portion, the system shall either:

1. Hold the alternate payee's portion until the time a personal representative makes a proper demand for payment of the alternate payee's portion.

2. Remit the alternate payee's portion to the participant, who shall hold the amounts in trust for the estate of the alternate payee until the personal representative is identified.  At that time the participant shall pay the alternate payee's portion paid by the system to the participant to the personal representative.

Thereafter, the plan shall prospectively pay the alternate payee's portion to the personal representative.

I. Amounts held or paid pursuant to this section shall not accrue interest unless otherwise prescribed by this article.

J. The system is not liable to the participant, the alternate payee, any personal representative of the estate of an alternate payee or any other person for any amount paid, withheld or disbursed by the system pursuant to this section.  If one or more payments are made by the system to a person not otherwise entitled to receive the payments, the recipient of the payment is designated a constructive trustee for the payment received and, together with the marital community, if any, is the sole party against whom an action may be brought to recover the payment.

K. The system may adopt policies and procedures that govern the implementation of this section.

 

#### Section 38-861. Future benefit increases; payment; cost calculation; definition

A. Any future benefit increase adopted by the legislature or any participating employer for any member of the system shall be fully paid in the year of enactment of the benefit and may not be amortized over any period of years.  A benefit for members hired before July 1, 2017 shall be paid by the employer and the cost of the benefit for members hired on or after July 1, 2017 shall be split equally between the employer and the member.

B. The plan actuary shall calculate the cost of the benefit increase using all of the following:

1. A discount rate equal to the ten-year treasury constant maturity rate for the fiscal year in which the benefit is enacted.

2. An expected rate of return on assets equal to the ten-year treasury constant maturity rate for the fiscal year in which the benefit is enacted.

3. A mortality table based on the most recent proposal from the retirement plans experience committee of the society of actuaries that is not older than the RP-2014 mortality table.

4. All other actuarial assumptions approved by the board for the most recent fiscal year valuation.

C. For the purposes of this section, "future benefit increase" includes any benefit increase that leads to a change in the present value of future benefits or a change to accrued liabilities.

 

#### Section 38-862. Discount rate; service purchase; transfer of service credits

A. Beginning July 1, 2017, the discount rate specified in subsection B of this section applies to service purchases or transfers of service credits to the system pursuant to the following sections:

1. Section 38-849, subsection D.

#### Section 38-883.01. Qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement; definitions

A. The board may establish a qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement for the sole purpose of enabling the board to continue to apply the same formula for determining benefits payable to all employees covered by the plan whose benefits under the plan are limited by section 415 of the internal revenue code.

B. The board shall administer the qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement. The board has full discretionary fiduciary authority to determine all questions arising in connection with the arrangement, including its interpretation and any factual questions arising under the arrangement.

C. All members and retired members of the plan are eligible to participate in the qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement if their benefits under the plan would exceed the limitations imposed by section 415 of the internal revenue code.

D. On or after the effective date of the qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement, the employer shall pay to each eligible member of the plan who retires on or after the effective date and to each retired member who retired before the effective date and that member's beneficiary, if required, a supplemental pension benefit equal to the amount by which the benefit that would have been payable under the plan, without regard to any provisions in the plan incorporating the limitation on benefits imposed by section 415 of the internal revenue code, exceeds the benefit actually payable taking into account the limitation imposed on the plan by section 415 of the internal revenue code. The board shall compute and pay the supplemental pension benefits under the same terms and conditions and to the same person as the benefits payable to or on account of a retired member under the plan.

E. The employer shall not fund benefits payable under the qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement. The employer shall pay benefits payable under the qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement out of the general assets of the employer. For administrative purposes, the employer may establish a grantor trust for the benefit of eligible members.

2. "Qualified governmental excess benefit arrangement" means a portion of the plan if:

(a) The portion is maintained solely to provide to members of the plan that part of a member's annual benefit that is otherwise payable under the terms of the plan and that exceeds the limitations imposed by section 415 of the internal revenue code.

(b) Under that portion, a direct or indirect election to defer compensation is not provided at any time to the member.

(c) Excess benefits are not paid from a trust that is a part of the plan unless the trust is maintained solely for the purpose of providing excess benefits.

 

#### Section 38-884. Membership of retirement plan; termination; credited service; redemption; reemployment

A. Each employee of a participating employer is a member of the plan unless the employee is receiving a pension from the plan.  A person employed shall undergo a medical examination performed by a designated physician or a physician working in a clinic that is appointed by the local board or, in the case of a state correctional officer who is employed by the state department of corrections, complete a physical examination pursuant to section 41-1822, subsection B. For the purposes of subsection B of this section, the designated physician or a physician working in a clinic that is appointed by the local board may be the employer's regular employee or contractor.

B. The purpose of the medical examination authorized by this section is to identify a member's physical or mental condition or injury that existed or occurred before the member's date of membership in the plan. Any employee who fails or refuses to submit to the medical examination prescribed in this section is deemed to waive all rights to disability benefits under this article. Medical examinations conducted under this article shall be conducted by a physician and shall not be conducted or used for purposes of hiring, advancing, discharging, job training or other terms, conditions and privileges of employment unrelated to receipt or qualification for pension benefits or service credits from the fund. This subsection does not affect or impair the right of an employer to prescribe medical or physical standards for employees or prospective employees.

C. If a member who becomes a member of the plan before January 1, 2012 ceases to be an employee for any reason other than death or retirement, within twenty days after filing a completed application with the board, the member is entitled to receive the following amounts, less any benefit payments the member has received and any amount the member may owe to the plan:

1. If the member has less than five years of credited service with the plan, the member may withdraw the member's accumulated contributions from the plan.

2. If the member has five or more years of credited service with the plan, the member may withdraw the member's accumulated contributions plus an amount equal to the amount determined as follows:

(a) 5.0 to 5.9 years of credited service, twenty-five percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-891, subsection B.

(b) 6.0 to 6.9 years of credited service, forty percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-891, subsection B.

(c) 7.0 to 7.9 years of credited service, fifty-five percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-891, subsection B.

(d) 8.0 to 8.9 years of credited service, seventy percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-891, subsection B.

(e) 9.0 to 9.9 years of credited service, eighty-five percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-891, subsection B.

(f) 10.0 or more years of credited service, one hundred percent of all member contributions deducted from the member's salary pursuant to section 38-891, subsection B.

D. If a member who becomes a member of the plan before January 1, 2012 has more than ten years of credited service with the plan, leaves the monies prescribed in subsection C of this section on account with the plan for more than thirty days after termination of employment and after that time period requests a refund of those monies, the member is entitled to receive the amount prescribed in subsection C of this section plus interest at a rate determined by the board for each year computed from and after the member's termination of employment.

E. The accumulated member contributions of a member who ceases to be an employee for a reason other than death or retirement and who becomes a member of the plan:

1. On or after January 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2018 shall be paid to the member plus interest at a rate determined by the board as of the date of termination within twenty days after filing with the plan a written application for payment.

2. For a member who has less than ten years of credited service with the plan, on or after July 1, 2018 shall be paid to the member plus interest at a rate determined by the board as of the date of termination within twenty days after filing with the plan a written application for payment.

F. If the refund includes monies that are an eligible rollover distribution and the member elects to have the distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account or annuity and specifies the eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account or annuity to which the distribution is to be paid, the distribution shall be made in the form of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to the specified eligible retirement plan. The distribution shall be made in the form and at the time prescribed by the board.

G. For distributions occurring from and after December 31, 2007, a member or a member's beneficiary, including a nonspouse designated beneficiary to the extent allowed under subsection H of this section, may roll over an eligible rollover distribution as defined in section 402(c)(4) of the internal revenue code to a Roth individual retirement account, if, for distributions occurring before January 1, 2010, the member or the member's beneficiary satisfies the requirements for making a Roth individual retirement account contribution under section 408A(c)(3)(B) of the internal revenue code, as in effect on the date of the rollover. Any amount rolled over to a Roth individual retirement account is included in the gross income of the member or the member's beneficiary to the extent the amounts would have been included in gross income if not rolled over as required under section 408A(d)(3)(A) of the internal revenue code. For the purposes of this subsection, the administrator is not responsible for ensuring the member or the member's beneficiary is eligible to make a rollover to a Roth individual retirement account.

H. For distributions made from and after December 31, 2009, a nonspouse designated beneficiary as defined in section 401(a)(9)(E) of the internal revenue code may elect to directly roll over an eligible rollover distribution to an individual retirement account under section 408(a) of the internal revenue code or an individual retirement annuity under section 408(b) of the internal revenue code that is established on behalf of the designated beneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited individual retirement plan pursuant to section 402(c)(11) of the internal revenue code. In order to be able to roll over the distribution, the distribution otherwise must satisfy the definition of an eligible rollover distribution as defined in section 402(c)(4) of the internal revenue code. In applying this subsection, a nonspouse rollover is subject to the direct rollover requirements under section 401(a)(31) of the internal revenue code, the rollover notice requirements under section 402(f) of the internal revenue code and the mandatory withholding requirements under section 3405(c) of the internal revenue code.

I. For plan years occurring before January 1, 2007, the period for providing the rollover notice as required under section 402(f) of the internal revenue code is not less than thirty days and not more than ninety days before the date of distribution and, for plan years beginning from and after December 31, 2006, the period for providing the rollover notice as required under section 402(f) of the internal revenue code is not less than thirty days and not more than one hundred eighty days before the date of distribution.

J. Service shall be credited to a member's individual credited service account in accordance with rules the local board prescribes. In no case shall more than twelve months of credited service be credited on account of all service rendered by a member in any one year. In no case shall service be credited for any period during which the member is not employed in a designated position, except as provided by sections 38-921 and 38-922.

K. Credited service is forfeited if the amounts prescribed in subsection C, D or E of this section are paid or are transferred in accordance with this section.

L. If a former member becomes reemployed with the same employer within two years after the former member's termination date, a member may have forfeited credited service attributable to service rendered during a prior period of service as an employee restored on satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

1. The member files with the plan a written application for reinstatement of forfeited credited service within ninety days after again becoming an employee.

2. The retirement fund is paid the total amount previously withdrawn pursuant to subsection C, D or E of this section plus compound interest from the date of withdrawal to the dates of repayment. Interest shall be computed at the rate of nine percent for each year compounded each year from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment.  Forfeited credited service shall not be restored until complete payment is received by the fund.

3. The required payment is completed within one year after returning to employee status.

M. If a member who receives a severance refund on termination of employment pursuant to subsection C, D or E of this section is subsequently reemployed by an employer, the member's prior service credits are cancelled, and the board shall credit service only from the date the member's most recent reemployment period commenced.  A present active member of the plan who received a refund of accumulated contributions from the plan pursuant to subsection C, D or E of this section, forfeited credited service pursuant to subsection K of this section and becomes reemployed with the same employer two years or more after the member's termination date or becomes reemployed with another employer may elect to redeem any part of that forfeited credited service by paying into the plan any amounts required pursuant to this subsection.  A present active member who elects to redeem any part of forfeited credited service for which the member is deemed eligible by the board shall pay into the plan the amounts previously paid or transferred as a refund of the member's accumulated contributions plus an amount, computed by the plan's actuary that is necessary to equal the increase in the actuarial present value of projected benefits resulting from the redemption calculated using the actuarial methods and assumptions prescribed by the plan's actuary.  On satisfaction of this obligation, the board shall reinstate the member's prior service credits.

N. A retired member may become employed by the employer from which the employee retired in a designated position and continue to receive a pension if the employment occurs at least six months after retirement.  The retired member shall not contribute to the fund and shall not accrue credited service.  If a retired member becomes employed by the employer from which the employee retired in a designated position before six months after retirement, the following apply:

1. Payment of the retired member's pension shall be suspended until the retired member again ceases to be an employee. The amount of pension shall not be changed on account of service as an employee subsequent to retirement.

2. The retired member shall not contribute to the fund and shall not accrue credited service.

3. Any pension payments received by a retired member, who retired on or after July 1, 2009, during a period of reemployment are considered overpayments pursuant to section 38-899.  If the board determines in the board's sole discretion, for a member who retired on or after July 1, 2009, that the retired member's reemployment during the six-month period and the failure of the employer or the local board to suspend the member's pension were not intentional to circumvent the requirements of this subsection, the pension payments received by the retired member during reemployment are subject to repayment up to only the amount received between the date of the member's reemployment and the expiration of the six-month period.

4. If a retired member who retired on or after July 1, 2009 and who is reemployed terminates employment, the retired member may be subsequently reemployed with the employer from which the member retired in a designated position and resume receiving pension payments after a period of six months, less the period of time the retired member was not reemployed by the employer from which the member retired in a designated position after retirement, if at least sixty days of the six months are consecutive.

O. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a member who retires having met all of the qualifications for retirement and who subsequently becomes an elected official, by election or appointment, is not considered reemployed by the same employer.

#### Section 38-884.01. Reinstatement of credited service; effect of prior law

A. A member who received a severance refund on termination of employment as provided in section 38-884, who is subsequently reemployed by an employer and who may have redeposited the amount withdrawn with interest as provided in section 38-884 or a member who redeems prior service pursuant to statute is subject to the benefits and duties in effect at the following times for the specified situations:

1. At the time of the member's reemployment if the member is reemployed by an employer other than the same employer.

2. At the time of the member's reemployment if the member is reemployed by the same employer at least ninety days after the date of termination.

3. At the time of the member's most recent termination if the member is reemployed by the same employer in any capacity within ninety days after the date of termination.

B. Subsection A of this section does not apply if a court of competent jurisdiction orders reinstatement of benefits and duties under a prior law.

C. If a member was initially employed on or after July 1, 2018, regardless of whether the member received a severance refund or redeposits the amount withdrawn with interest, the member shall return to the plan as irrevocably elected pursuant to section 38-881.01.

D. A member who transfers credited service from one employer to another employer pursuant to section 38-908 retains the benefits and duties in effect at the time of the member's transfer.

#### Section 38-885. Normal retirement; conditions and pension

A. A member may retire if the member:

1. Files a written application for normal retirement with the plan in the form prescribed by the plan.

2. Ceases to be an employee before the date of retirement.

If the member retires with more than twenty years of credited service the foregoing amount shall be increased by a monthly amount equal to two percent of the member's average monthly salary multiplied by the number of the member's years of credited service in excess of twenty years, with pro rata increase for any fractional years, except that if a member retires with twenty-five or more years of credited service the foregoing amount shall be increased by a monthly amount equal to two and one-half percent of the member's average monthly salary multiplied by the number of the member's years of credited service in excess of twenty years, with pro rata increase for any fractional year.

2. If the member retires pursuant to subsection B of this section but has less than twenty years of credited service, the member is entitled to receive a pension equal to the product of:

(a) Two and one-half percent of the member's average monthly salary.

(b) The member's credited service.

D. A person who becomes a member of the plan on or after January 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2018 is eligible for a normal retirement pension if the person satisfies one of the following requirements:

A person who becomes a member of the plan on or after July 1, 2018 and who retires on or after the member's normal retirement date shall receive a monthly amount equal to the member's average monthly salary multiplied by the number of whole and fractional years of credited service multiplied by the following:

1. 1.25 percent if the member has at least ten years of credited service but less than fifteen years of credited service.

#### Section 38-885.01. Reverse deferred retirement option plan; purpose

A. A reverse deferred retirement option plan is established. The purpose of the reverse deferred retirement option plan is to add flexibility to the plan and to provide members who elect to participate in the reverse deferred retirement option plan access to a lump sum benefit in addition to their normal monthly retirement benefit on actual retirement.

B. The board shall offer the reverse deferred retirement option plan to members on a voluntary basis as an alternative method of benefit accrual under the plan.

D. A member who elects to participate in the reverse deferred retirement option plan shall voluntarily and irrevocably:

1. Designate a reverse deferred retirement option plan date that is the first day of the calendar month immediately following a member's completion of twenty-four years of credited service or a date not more than sixty consecutive months before the date the member elects to participate in the reverse deferred retirement option plan, whichever is later.

1. An amount that is credited as though accrued monthly from the reverse deferred retirement option plan date to the date the member elected to participate in the reverse deferred retirement option plan and that is computed in the same manner as a normal retirement benefit using the factors of credited service and average monthly salary in effect on the reverse deferred retirement option plan date.

2. An amount that is credited as though accrued monthly and that represents interest at a rate equal to the yield on a five year treasury note as of the first day of the month as published by the federal reserve board.

#### Section 38-886. Accidental disability retirement; total and permanent disability retirement; qualification; amount of pension; conditions for continued payment of pension

A. A member may retire and receive an accidental disability pension or a total and permanent disability pension if the local board finds that all of the following conditions occur:

1. An application for disability retirement is filed with the retirement plan or the local board by either the member or the member's participating employer after the disabling incident or within one year after the date the member ceases to be an employee and the member's employment is terminated by reason of accidental disability or total and permanent disability. Timely application for an accidental or a total and permanent disability pension is a prerequisite to receipt of the pension.

2. The member undergoes all medical examinations and tests ordered by the local board and releases to the local board all medical reports and records requested by the local board.

3. The local board determines that an accidental disability or total and permanent disability condition exists that meets the requirements for accidental disability retirement or total and permanent disability retirement.

B. The effective date of an accidental disability retirement or a total and permanent disability retirement shall not predate the date of disability or the date the member ceases to be an employee, and the disability pension payments shall not violate section 38-895.02.

C. The amount of an accidental disability pension or a total and permanent disability pension is equal to fifty per cent of the member's average monthly salary or the amount computed using the member's average monthly salary and the member's actual years of credited service, whichever is higher.

D. The local board may require a retired member with a disability to undergo periodic reevaluation of the continuation of accidental disability or total and permanent disability. If the retired member with a disability refuses to submit to reevaluation, the local board may suspend payment of the pension. If the refusal continues for one year, the local board may revoke the retired member's with a disability rights to the pension. An accidental disability pension or a total and permanent disability pension is terminated if the local board finds the retired member no longer meets the requirements for accidental disability retirement or total and permanent disability retirement.  This subsection does not apply after a retired member with a disability reaches the member's normal retirement date.  The amount of a disability pension shall not be recomputed at a retired member's with a disability normal retirement date.

E. A member does not qualify for an accidental disability pension or a total and permanent disability pension if the local board determines that the member's disability results from any of the following:

1. An injury suffered while engaged in a felonious criminal act or enterprise.

2. Service in the armed forces of the United States that entitles the member to a veteran's disability pension.

3. A physical or mental condition or injury that existed or occurred before the member's date of membership in the plan.

F. Local boards shall base a finding of total and permanent disability and accidental disability on medical evidence obtained by a designated physician or a physician working in a clinic that is selected by the local board and shall disregard any other medical evidence or opinions.  If the local board retains more than one physician in connection with any case, the local board shall resolve any material conflicts in the medical evidence that is presented by the local board's designated physicians or clinics.

G. If an accidental disability ceases before a retired member reaches the member's normal retirement date and the member is reemployed by an employer under the plan, the pension payable on the member's subsequent retirement shall be determined as provided in section 38-885.

 

#### Section 38-886.01. Ordinary disability retirement; qualifications; amount of pension; conditions for continued payment of pension; definition

A. A member may retire and receive an ordinary disability pension if the local board finds that all of the following conditions occur:

1. An application for disability retirement is filed with the retirement plan or the local board by either the member or the member's participating employer after the disabling incident or within one year after the date the member ceases to be an employee and the member's employment is terminated before the member's normal retirement date by reason of ordinary disability. Timely application for an ordinary disability pension is a prerequisite to receipt of the pension.

2. The member undergoes all medical examinations and tests ordered by the local board and releases to the local board all medical reports and records requested by the local board.

3. The local board determines that an ordinary disability condition exists that meets the requirements for an ordinary disability.

4. The member is not participating in the reverse deferred retirement option plan pursuant to section 38-885.01.

B. The effective date of an ordinary disability retirement shall not predate the date of disability or the date the member ceases to be an employee, and the disability pension payments shall not violate section 38-895.02.

C. Except for a full-time dispatcher or a person who becomes a member of the plan on or after January 1, 2012, the amount of an ordinary disability pension is equal to a fraction times the member's normal retirement pension that is computed pursuant to section 38-885, subsection C as if the member had twenty years of credited service. The fraction is the result obtained by dividing the member's actual years of credited service, not to exceed twenty years of credited service, by twenty. For a full-time dispatcher or a person who becomes a member of the plan on or after January 1, 2012, the amount of an ordinary disability pension is equal to a fraction times the member's normal retirement pension that is computed pursuant to section 38-885, subsection E as if the member had twenty-five years of credited service or subsection F as if the member had twenty-five years of credited service. The fraction is the result obtained by dividing the member's actual years of credited service, not to exceed twenty-five years of credited service, by twenty-five.

D. The local board may require a retired member with a disability to undergo periodic reevaluation of the continuation of ordinary disability. If the retired member with a disability refuses to submit to reevaluation, the local board may suspend payment of the pension. If the refusal continues for one year, the local board may revoke the rights to the pension of the retired member with a disability.  An ordinary disability pension is terminated if the local board finds the retired member no longer meets the requirements for ordinary disability retirement. This subsection does not apply after a retired member with a disability reaches the member's normal retirement date. The amount of a disability pension shall not be recomputed at the normal retirement date of a retired member with a disability.

E. A member does not qualify for an ordinary disability pension if the local board determines that the member's disability results from any of the following:

1. An injury suffered while engaged in a felonious criminal act or enterprise.

2. Service in the armed forces of the United States that entitles the member to a veteran's disability pension.

3. A physical or mental condition or injury that existed or occurred before the member's date of membership in the plan.

F. Local boards shall base a finding of ordinary disability on medical evidence that is obtained by a designated physician or a physician working in a clinic selected by the local board and shall disregard any other medical evidence or opinions.  If the local board retains more than one physician or clinic in connection with the application, the local board shall resolve any material conflicts presented in the medical evidence that is presented by the designated physicians or clinics.

G. If an ordinary disability ceases before a retired member reaches the member's normal retirement date and the member is reemployed by an employer under the plan, the pension payable on the member's subsequent retirement shall be determined as provided in section 38-885.

H. For the purposes of this section, "ordinary disability" means a physical condition that the local board determines will prevent an employee from totally and permanently performing a reasonable range of duties within the employee's department or a mental condition that the local board determines will prevent an employee from totally and permanently engaging in any substantial gainful activity.

#### Section 38-887. Pension to surviving spouse of deceased retired member

The surviving spouse of a deceased retired member is entitled to receive a surviving spouse's pension if the spouse was married to the member for a period of at least two consecutive years at the time of the member's death.  Payment of a surviving spouse's pension commences as of the last day of the month following the retired member's date of death.  The last payment shall be made as of the last day of the month in which the surviving spouse's death occurs. The amount of pension paid a surviving spouse is equal to four-fifths of the amount of the deceased retired member's pension at the time of death.  The surviving spouse shall file a written application with the plan in order to receive the survivor benefit.

 

#### Section 38-888. Pension to the surviving spouse of a member

A. The surviving spouse of a deceased member is entitled to receive a surviving spouse's pension if the spouse was married to the member on the date of the member's death. Payment of a surviving spouse's pension commences as of the last day of the month following the member's date of death.  The last payment shall be made as of the last day of the month in which the surviving spouse's death occurs. The amount of a surviving spouse's pension is forty percent of the deceased member's average monthly salary or four-fifths of what the deceased member's pension would have been on the date of death had the member been retired, whichever is greater. The surviving spouse shall file a written application with the plan in order to receive the survivor benefit.

B. The surviving spouse of a deceased member who is killed in the line of duty or dies from injuries suffered in the line of duty is entitled to receive a monthly amount equal to the deceased member's average monthly benefit compensation. For the purposes of this subsection, "killed in the line of duty" means the decedent's death was the direct and proximate result of physical injuries incurred in the performance of the decedent's public safety duties and does not include suicide.

C. If a deceased member does not have an eligible surviving spouse or the pension of the eligible surviving spouse is terminated, each eligible child is entitled to a child's pension as calculated pursuant to section 38-904.

#### Section 38-889. Guaranteed minimum aggregate payout

If all pension payments permanently terminate before an aggregate amount equal to the retired member's or deceased member's accumulated member contributions has been paid, the difference between the amount of accumulated member contributions and the aggregate amount of pension payments made shall be paid to the individual or individuals whom the member may have named on a form provided by and filed with the retirement plan. If no such named individual survives, the difference shall be paid to the legal representative of the last surviving individual who was being paid a pension or the last surviving named individual.

#### Section 38-890. Pensions; commencement and duration

A. A normal retirement pension, an accidental disability pension, a total and permanent disability pension or an ordinary disability pension commences on the first day of the calendar month next following the member's date of retirement. A survivor pension commences on the first day of the calendar month next following the month in which the death causing payment of the pension occurs.

B. Termination of payment of a pension occurs at the end of the calendar month in which the event causing the termination occurred. The payment shall be made for the full month of termination.

C. A change in the amount of a pension occurs on the first day of the calendar month next following the date of the event causing the change.

D. The plan shall make payments pursuant to section 401(a)(9) of the internal revenue code and the regulations that are issued under that section. Notwithstanding any other provision of the plan, beginning January 1, 1987 payment of benefits to a member shall commence not later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of:

1. The calendar year in which the member attains seventy-two years of age.

2. The date the member terminates employment.

#### Section 38-891. Employer and member contributions

A. As determined by actuarial valuations reported to the employers and the local boards by the board, each employer shall make contributions sufficient under the actuarial valuations to meet both the normal cost for members hired before July 1, 2018 plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the unfunded accrued liability on a level percent of salary basis for all employees of the employer who are members of the plan or participants as defined in section 38-865, paragraph 7, subdivision (b) over, beginning July 1, 2018, a closed period of not more than twenty years, except as provided in subsection M or O of this section, that is established by the board taking into account the recommendation of the plan's actuary, except that, beginning with fiscal year 2006-2007, except as otherwise provided, the employer contribution rate shall not be less than six percent of salary. For any employer whose actual contribution rate is less than six percent of salary for fiscal year 2006-2007 and each year thereafter, that employer's contribution rate shall be at least five percent and not more than the employer's actual contribution rate. An employer may pay a higher level percent of salary thereby reducing its unfunded past service liability.  All contributions made by the employers and all state taxes allocated to the fund shall be irrevocable and shall be used to pay benefits under the plan or to pay expenses of the plan and fund. The minimum employer contribution that is paid and that is in excess of the normal cost plus the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the unfunded accrued liability as calculated pursuant to this subsection shall be used to reduce future employer contribution increases and shall not be used to pay for an increase in benefits that are otherwise payable to members. The board shall separately account for these monies in the fund.  Forfeitures arising because of severance of employment before a member becomes eligible for a pension or for any other reason shall be applied to reduce the cost to the employer, not to increase the benefits otherwise payable to members.  After the close of any fiscal year, if the plan's actuary determines that the actuarial valuation of an employer's account contains excess valuation assets other than excess valuation assets that were in the employer's account as of fiscal year 2004-2005 and is more than one hundred percent funded, the board shall account for fifty percent of the excess valuation assets in a stabilization reserve account. After the close of any fiscal year, if the plan's actuary determines that the actuarial valuation of an employer's account has a valuation asset deficiency and an unfunded actuarial accrued liability, the board shall use any valuation assets in the stabilization reserve account for that employer, to the extent available, to limit the decline in that employer's funding ratio to not more than two percent.

B. Each member who was hired before July 1, 2018, shall contribute the amount prescribed in subsection H of this section to the retirement plan.  Each member who was hired on or after July 1, 2018, through the member's period of service from the member's effective date of participation, shall contribute an amount equal to the amount prescribed in subsection K of this section. Member contributions shall be made by payroll deduction.  Continuation of employment by the member constitutes consent and agreement to the deduction of the applicable member contribution. Payment of the member's salary less the deducted contributions constitutes full and complete discharge and satisfaction of all claims and demands of the member relating to salary for services rendered during the period covered by the payment. A member may not, under any circumstance, borrow from, take a loan against or remove contributions from the member's account before the termination of membership in the plan or the receipt of a pension.

C. Each employer shall transfer to the board the employer and employee contributions provided for in this section within ten working days after each payroll date.  Contributions transferred after that date shall include a penalty of ten percent per annum, compounded annually, for each day the contributions are late. The employer shall pay this penalty. Delinquent payments due under this subsection, together with interest charges as provided in this subsection, may be recovered by action in a court of competent jurisdiction against an employer liable for the payments or, at the request of the board, may be deducted from any other monies, including excise revenue taxes, payable to the employer by any department or agency of this state.

D. During a period when an employee is on industrial leave and the employee elects to continue contributions during the period of industrial leave, the employer and employee shall make contributions based on the salary the employee would have received in the employee's job classification if the employee was in normal employment status.

E. The local board of the state department of corrections or the local board of the department of juvenile corrections may specify a position within that department as a designated position if the position is filled by an employee who has at least five years of credited service under the plan, who is transferred to temporarily fill the position and who makes a written request to the local board to specify the position as a designated position within ninety days after being transferred. On the employee leaving the position, the position is no longer a designated position.

F. The local board of the state department of corrections, the local board of the department of juvenile corrections, the local board of the judiciary or the local board of a county, city or town that operates detention facilities may specify a designated position within the department or facility as a nondesignated position if the position is filled by an employee who has at least five years of credited service under the Arizona state retirement system and who makes a written request to the local board to specify the position as a nondesignated position within ninety days after accepting the position.  On the employee leaving the position, the position reverts to a designated position.

G. The local board of the judiciary may specify positions within the administrative office of the courts that require direct contact with and primarily provide training or technical expertise to county probation, surveillance or juvenile detention officers as a designated position if the position is filled by an employee who is a member of the plan currently employed in a designated position as a probation, surveillance or juvenile detention officer and who has at least five years of credited service under the plan.  An employee who fills such a position shall make a written request to the local board to specify the position as a designated position within ninety days after accepting the position.  On the employee leaving the position, the position reverts to a nondesignated position.

H. The amount contributed by a member who was hired before July 1, 2018 pursuant to subsection B of this section is:

1. Through June 30, 2011, 8.41 percent of the member's salary, except for a full-time dispatcher. The amount contributed by a full-time dispatcher through June 30, 2011 is 7.96 percent of the member's salary.

2. For fiscal year 2011-2012 and each fiscal year thereafter, 8.41 percent of the member's salary or fifty percent of the sum of the member's contribution rate from the preceding fiscal year and the aggregate computed employer contribution rate that is calculated pursuant to subsection A of this section, whichever is lower, except that the member contribution rate shall not be less than 7.65 percent of the member's salary and the employer contribution rate shall not be less than the rate prescribed in subsection A of this section.

I. Notwithstanding subsection H, paragraph 2 of this section, the contribution rate for a full-time dispatcher is forty-five basis points less than the member contribution amount calculated pursuant to subsection H, paragraph 2 of this section, except that after the close of any fiscal year, if the plan's actuary determines that the aggregate ratio of the funding value of the accrued assets to the accrued liabilities of the fund is at least one hundred percent, from and after June 30 of the following year the member contribution rate for a full-time dispatcher is equal to the member contribution rate for a member who is not a full-time dispatcher.

J. For fiscal year 2011-2012 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount of the member's contribution that exceeds 8.41 percent of the member's salary for a member other than a full-time dispatcher or 7.96 percent of the member's salary for a full-time dispatcher shall not be used to reduce the employer's contributions that are calculated pursuant to subsection A of this section.

K. For members hired on or after July 1, 2018, the employer and member contributions are determined as follows:

1. As determined by actuarial valuations reported to the employer and the local board by the board of trustees, each employer shall make contributions sufficient under such actuarial valuations to pay 33.3 percent of the normal cost plus 50 percent of the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the total unfunded accrued liability for each employer attributable only to those members hired on or after July 1, 2018.  For each year that new unfunded liabilities are attributable to the employer's own members hired on or after July 1, 2018, a new amortization base representing the most recent annual gain or loss, smoothed over a period not more than five years as determined by the board, shall be created on a level-dollar basis over a closed period equal to the average expected remaining service lives of all members but not more than ten years, as determined by the board.

2. The remaining 66.7 percent of the normal cost and the remaining 50 percent of the actuarially determined amount required to amortize the total unfunded accrued liability as determined pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be divided by the total number of the employer's members who were hired on or after July 1, 2018 such that each member contributes an equal percentage of the member's compensation. Member contributions shall begin simultaneously with membership in the plan and shall be made by payroll deduction.

L. In any fiscal year, an employer's contribution to the plan in combination with member contributions may not be less than the actuarially determined normal cost for that fiscal year. The board may not suspend contributions to the plan unless both of the following apply:

1. The plan's actuary, based on the annual valuation, determines that continuing to accrue excess earnings could result in disqualification of the plan's tax-exempt status under the provisions of the United States internal revenue code.

2. The board determines that the receipt of any additional contributions required under this section would conflict with its fiduciary responsibility.

M. For the purposes of calculating unfunded liability amortization payments pursuant to subsection A of this section, an employer may make a onetime election to request that the board use a closed period of not more than thirty years if the employer meets both of the following requirements:

1. The governing body of the employer adopts a resolution requesting the longer amortization period and specifying the actuarial valuation date for which the new amortization period is to begin. The actuarial valuation date chosen must be the plan's fiscal year end either immediately before or immediately after the date of the resolution.

2. The employer submits a written request for the longer amortization period along with the adopted resolution to the administrator of the board.

N. For the purposes of subsection M of this section, employer does not include this state or any state agency.

O. For the purposes of calculating unfunded liability amortization payments pursuant to subsection A of this section, the board may use a closed period of not more than thirty years for the judiciary.

P. If a member's employment is terminated with an employer by either party, the total liability under the plan associated with the member's service with the employer remains with the employer.

#### Section 38-891.01. Retired member; return to work; employer contributions

A. An employer shall pay contributions at an alternate contribution rate on behalf of a retired member who returns to work in any capacity in a position ordinarily filled by an employee of the employer in a designated position.  This section applies to a retired member who has been retired for more than twelve consecutive months.

B. The alternate contribution rate shall be equal to that portion of the individual employer's total required contribution that is applied to the amortization of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability for the fiscal year beginning July 1, based on the fund's actuary's calculation of the total required contribution for the preceding fiscal year ended on June 30.  The alternate contribution rate shall be applied to the compensation, gross salary or contract fee of a retired member who meets the requirements of this section.

C. The alternate contribution rate shall not be less than six percent in any fiscal year.

D. All contributions made by the employer and allocated to the fund established by section 38-882 are irrevocable and shall be used as benefits under this article or to pay the expenses of the plan. Payments made pursuant to this section by employers become delinquent after the due date prescribed in section 38-891, subsection C, and thereafter shall be increased by interest from and after that date until payment is received by the plan.

E. An employer of a retired member shall submit any reports, data, paperwork or materials that are requested by the board and that are necessary to determine the compensation, gross salary or contract fee associated with a retired member who returns to work or to determine the function, use, efficacy or operation of the return to work program.

 

#### Section 38-892. Internal revenue code section 414(h) pickup of member contributions

Each participating employer shall pick up the contributions required of members on account of compensation paid after the effective date specified in the resolution of the board activating the provisions of this section.  The picked up contributions shall be treated as participating employer contributions for the purpose of tax treatment under the United States internal revenue code. The specified effective date shall not be before the date the retirement plan receives notification from the internal revenue service that pursuant to section 414(h) of the internal revenue code the member contributions picked up shall not be included in gross income for income tax purposes until the time that the picked up contributions are distributed by refund or pension payments. The participating employers shall pick up the member contributions from funds established and available in a retirement deduction account, which funds would otherwise have been designated as member contributions and paid to the retirement plan. Member contributions picked up pursuant to this section shall be treated for all other purposes, in the same manner and to the same extent, as member contributions made before the effective date.

 

#### Section 38-893. Local boards; powers and duties; rules; hearings; administrative review

A. To the extent outlined in this section, the administration of the plan and the responsibility for making the provisions of the plan effective for each employer are vested in a local board. The state department of corrections, the department of juvenile corrections, the department of public safety, each participating county sheriff's department, each participating city or town, each participating employer of full-time dispatchers for eligible groups as defined in section 38-842 and the judiciary shall have a local board.

For each participating county, the chairperson of the board of supervisors, or the chairperson's designee who is approved by the board of supervisors, as chairperson, two members who are elected by secret ballot by members employed by the participating county in a designated position and two citizens, one of whom shall be the head of the merit system if it exists for the group of members, who are appointed by the chairperson of the board of supervisors with the approval of the board of supervisors.

3. For political subdivisions, the mayor or chief elected official or a designee of the mayor or chief elected official approved by the respective governing body as chairperson, two members elected by secret ballot by members employed by the appropriate employer and two citizens, one of whom shall be the head of the merit system if it exists for the group of members, appointed by the mayor or chief elected official and with the approval of the city council or governing body of the employer.

If the board of trustees cannot find individuals to serve on the local board who meet the requirements of subsection A of this section, the board of trustees may appoint individuals to serve as interim local board members until qualified individuals are appointed or elected.  Within ten days after the member's appointment or election, each member of a local board shall take an oath of office that, so far as it devolves on the member, the member shall diligently and honestly administer the affairs of the local board and shall not knowingly violate or willingly allow to be violated any of the provisions of law applicable to the plan. Within one hundred eighty days after appointment or election, each board member shall complete local board training as prescribed by the board of trustees, including open meeting laws, ethics, legal review and fiduciary responsibilities and duties.

D. Except as limited by subsection E of this section, a local board shall:

Notwithstanding any limitations periods imposed in this article, including subsections G and H of this section, if the board of trustees determines a local board decision violates the internal revenue code or threatens to impair the plan's status as a qualified plan under the internal revenue code, the local board's decision is not final and binding and the board of trustees may refrain from implementing or complying with the local board decision.

F. A local board shall establish and adopt rules as it deems necessary for its administration and to adjudicate claims or disputes. At a minimum the board's rules shall incorporate the model uniform rules for local board procedure that are issued by the board of trustees.  All rules and decisions of a local board shall be uniformly and consistently applied to all members in similar circumstances. If a claim or dispute is presented to a local board for determination but the local board has not yet adopted uniform rules of procedure for adjudication of the claim or dispute, the local board shall adopt and use the model uniform rules of local board procedure that are issued by the board of trustees' fiduciary counsel to adjudicate the claim or dispute.

G.

H. A claimant may apply for or the board of trustees may require a rehearing before the local board within the time periods prescribed in this subsection, except that if a decision of a local board violates the internal revenue code or threatens to jeopardize the plan's status as a qualified plan under the internal revenue code, any limitation period for the board of trustees to require a rehearing of a local board decision does not apply. A claimant or the board of trustees shall file an application for rehearing in writing with a member of the local board or its secretary within sixty days after:

1. The claimant receives notification of the local board's original action by certified mail, by attending the meeting at which the action is taken or by receiving benefits from the plan pursuant to the local board's original action, whichever occurs first.

2. The board of trustees receives notification of the local board's original action as prescribed by subsection G of this section by email or certified mail.

I. A hearing before a local board on a matter remanded from the superior court is not subject to a rehearing before the local board.

J. Decisions of local boards are subject to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

K. When making a ruling, determination or calculation, the local board is entitled to rely on information furnished by the employer, the board of trustees, independent legal counsel or the actuary for the plan.

Within one hundred eighty days after election, the local board secretary shall complete local board training as prescribed by the board of trustees, including open meeting laws, ethics, legal review and fiduciary responsibilities and duties.

N. Each local board shall hire an independent legal counsel. The local board's independent legal counsel may not be employed by or contracted with the employer or any employee organizations. The independent legal counsel may not represent a member of the plan before any local board or any judicial appeal of a local board decision.  The local board's independent legal counsel shall review the model uniform rules for local board procedure that are issued by the board of trustees.

O. The employer and not the board of trustees or plan shall pay the fees of the medical board and of the local board's legal counsel and all other expenses of the local board necessary for the administration of the plan at rates and in amounts as the local board approves.

P. The local board shall issue directions to the board of trustees concerning all benefits that are to be paid from the employer's account pursuant to the provisions of the fund.

#### Section 38-894. Financial objective of the retirement plan; participating employer contributions

A. The financial objective of the retirement plan is to receive contributions each fiscal year which are sufficient to both:

1. Fund the actuarial cost of benefits likely to be paid on account of credited service earned by members during the fiscal year.

2. Fund the unfunded actuarial cost of benefits likely to be paid on account of credited service earned by members before the fiscal year over a period of not more than forty years. Contribution requirements shall be determined by an annual actuarial valuation using a generally recognized level per cent of payroll actuarial cost method.

B. The board may require an employer that proposes to become a participating employer after the plan has been in operation for more than one year to make supplemental contributions based on the excess of the actuarial costs associated with the proposed participation over the actuarial costs of the plan indicated by the last annual actuarial valuation of the plan. The amount of supplemental contributions shall be determined by actuarial valuation. The board may pay the cost of the actuarial valuation or may require the employer to pay the cost.

C. Beginning in fiscal year 2021-2022, and every third fiscal year thereafter, the board shall adjust the annual compensation limit specified in subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section by the average change in the probation wage index as determined pursuant to this subsection.  The board shall annually publish the probation wage index in January.  The annual compensation limit adjustment under this subsection for a calendar year applies to the annual compensation for that calendar year.  To determine the probation wage index:

1. The administrative office of the courts shall provide to the board pay scales for the month of July for the classifications of probation officers, by county, annually in July.

#### Section 38-899. Correction of errors

The retirement plan shall correct errors in the records of the retirement plan. The retirement plan shall seek to recover overpayments and shall make up underpayments.

#### Section 38-900. Internal revenue code qualification

The legislature intends that the retirement plan is a qualified pension plan under section 401 of the internal revenue code, as amended, or successor provisions of law, and that the trust is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the internal revenue code, as amended.  The assets of the fund are held in trust for the exclusive benefit of the members and beneficiaries of the retirement plan. The board may adopt such additional provisions to the retirement plan as are necessary to fulfill this intent.

 

#### Section 38-900.01. Statutory construction

A. Because the plan as enacted at a particular time is a unique amalgam of rights and obligations having a critical impact on the actuarial integrity of the plan, the legislature intends that the plan as enacted at a particular time be construed and applied as a coherent whole and without reference to any other provision of the plan in effect at a different time.

B. The plan was established in order to provide a uniform, consistent and equitable statewide program for those eligible corrections officers as defined by the plan.  A member of the plan does not have a vested right to benefits under the plan until the member files an application for benefits and is found eligible for those benefits.  An eligible claimant's right to benefits vests on the date of the member's application for those benefits or the member's last day of employment under the plan, whichever occurs first.

#### Section 38-900.02. Adjustment and refund; termination of plan

A. If more than the correct amount of employer or member contributions is paid into the plan by an employer through a mistake of fact, the board shall return those contributions to the employer if the employer requests return of the contributions within one year after the date of the overpayment.

The governing body or agency of the employer shall designate all full-time dispatchers for membership in the plan except for a full-time dispatcher who signs an irrevocable agreement before the joinder agreement becomes effective electing not to become a member of the plan.  A full-time dispatcher employed by an employer who becomes eligible for membership in the plan pursuant to this section may elect to participate in the plan within the deadlines and pursuant to the terms prescribed for such participation by the board.

D.

That portion of the transferred assets that is attributable to employee contributions, including interest credits, shall be properly allocated to each affected employee of the employer and credited to the employee's initial accumulated contributions in accordance with a schedule furnished by the employer to the board.

#### Section 38-910. Domestic relations orders; procedures; payments

A. Notwithstanding any other law, in a judicial proceeding for annulment, dissolution of marriage or legal separation that provides for the distribution of community property, or in any judicial proceeding to amend or enforce such a property distribution, a court in this state may issue a domestic relations order that provides that all or any part of a participant's benefit or refund in the plan that would otherwise be payable to that participant shall instead be paid by the plan to an alternate payee.

B. A domestic relations order is not effective against the plan unless the domestic relations order is approved by the plan and qualifies as a plan approved domestic relations order.  To qualify as a plan approved domestic relations order, a domestic relations order shall comply with any policies or procedures adopted pursuant to subsection K and shall also meet all of the following requirements:

1. The domestic relations order shall state the name and the last known mailing address of the participant and the name and last known mailing address of the alternate payee that is covered by the domestic relations order.

2. The domestic relations order shall clearly state the amount or percentage of the participant's benefits that is payable by the plan to the alternate payee or the precise manner in which the amount or percentage is to be determined.

3. The domestic relations order shall state the number of payments or periods to which the domestic relations order applies, if applicable.

4. The domestic relations order shall state that the domestic relations order applies to the plan.

5. The domestic relations order shall not require the plan to provide any type or form of benefit or any option not otherwise provided by this article.

6. The domestic relations order shall not require the plan to provide increased benefits determined on the basis of actuarial value.

7. The domestic relations order shall not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee if the benefits are required to be paid to another alternate payee under a separate plan approved domestic relations order.

8. The domestic relations order shall have been issued by a court of competent jurisdiction of a state, territory or possession of the United States.

C. On receipt by the plan of a certified copy of a domestic relations order and a written request for a determination that the domestic relations order is a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall promptly issue a written notice of receipt stating that the domestic relations order and request were received to the participant and alternate payee at the addresses on file, if any.

D. The plan has a determination period to issue a written determination indicating whether a domestic relations order qualifies as a plan approved domestic relations order. If the participant is receiving benefits during the determination period, and if the plan can determine the amount of the benefits that currently would be payable to the alternate payee if the domestic relations order were a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall hold the segregated funds and shall pay the remaining portion of the benefits to the participant. If the plan determines the domestic relations order is a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall pay the participant and alternate payee pursuant to the plan approved domestic relations order in the month following the month in which the determination was issued, or in the month following the month in which a benefit is payable under the plan approved domestic relations order, whichever is later. If the plan determines the domestic relations order fails to qualify as a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall specify in its determination how the domestic relations order is deficient and how it may be amended to qualify as a plan approved domestic relations order.  If the participant is currently receiving benefits, and if the plan can determine the amount of segregated funds that would be payable to the alternate payee if the domestic relations order were a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall hold the segregated funds during the cure period to allow the parties to submit a certified copy of an amended domestic relations order and a written request for a determination that the amended domestic relations order is a plan approved domestic relations order.  During the cure period, the plan shall pay the participant's portion to the participant.  At the end of the cure period, if the issue of whether an amended domestic relations order qualifies as a plan approved domestic relations order remains undetermined or if an amended domestic relations order is determined not to be a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall pay the segregated funds and the participant's portion to the participant.  The participant shall hold the segregated funds in trust for the alternate payee as provided in subsection J. If an amended domestic relations order that is submitted after the expiration of the cure period is determined to be a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall make payments to an alternate payee under the plan approved domestic relations order only prospectively.  A determination by the plan that a domestic relations order is not a plan approved domestic relations order does not prohibit a participant or alternate payee from submitting an amended domestic relations order to the plan.

E. Each participant and alternate payee is responsible for maintaining a current mailing address on file with the plan. The plan has no duty to attempt to locate any participant or alternate payee. The plan has no duty to provide a notice of receipt or determination or pay benefits by means other than mailing the notice or payments to the participant or alternate payee at the last known address that is on file with the plan.  If the address of an alternate payee is unknown to the plan, but benefits are payable to the alternate payee pursuant to a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall either:

1. Hold the alternate payee's portion until such a time as the alternate payee provides the plan with a current address.  Once the plan is notified of the alternate payee's current address, the plan shall prospectively pay the alternate payee's portion to the alternate payee.

2. Pay the alternate payee's portion to the participant, who shall hold the alternate payee's portion in trust as provided in subsection J, until such a time as the alternate payee is located.  At that time the participant shall pay the alternate payee's portion directly to the alternate payee.

F. If the address of a participant is unknown to the plan, but benefits are payable to the participant pursuant to a plan approved domestic relations order, the plan shall hold the participant's portion until the participant provides the plan with a current address.

G. If the alternate payee identified in a plan approved domestic relations order predeceases the participant and the plan approved domestic relations order does not otherwise provide for the disposition of the alternate payee's interest the plan shall pay the alternate payee's portion to the personal representative of the deceased alternate payee pursuant to this subsection.  The personal representative is responsible for maintaining a current mailing address on file with the plan.  The plan has no duty to attempt to locate any personal representative.  The plan is not responsible for making benefit payments to a personal representative until the personal representative has both:

1. Persuaded the plan that the personal representative is authorized to receive payments designated for the deceased alternate payee.

2. Provided the plan with an address to which the payments should be sent.

H. If, within thirty days after the date the plan verifies an alternate payee's death, a personal representative does not make demand on the plan for the alternate payee's portion, the plan shall either:

1. Hold the alternate payee's portion until the time a personal representative makes a proper demand for payment of the alternate payee's portion.

2. Remit the alternate payee's portion to the participant, who shall hold the amounts in trust for the estate of the alternate payee until the personal representative is identified.  At that time the participant shall pay the alternate payee's portion paid by the plan to the participant to the personal representative.

Thereafter, the plan shall prospectively pay the alternate payee's portion to the personal representative.

I. Amounts held or paid pursuant to this section shall not accrue interest unless otherwise prescribed by this article.

J. The plan is not liable to the participant, the alternate payee, any personal representative of the estate of an alternate payee or any other person for any amount paid, withheld or disbursed by the plan pursuant to this section.  If one or more payments are made by the plan to a person not otherwise entitled to receive the payments, the recipient of the payment is designated a constructive trustee for the payment received and, together with the marital community, if any, is the sole party against whom an action may be brought to recover the payment.

K. The plan may adopt policies and procedures that govern the implementation of this section.

 

#### Section 38-911. Deferred annuity; eligibility; amount; exception

A. If any member who has at least ten years of credited service terminates employment for reasons other than retirement or disability, the person may elect to receive a deferred annuity, except that if the person withdraws the person's accumulated contributions from the plan, all rights to a deferred annuity are forfeited. A deferred annuity is a lifetime monthly payment that is actuarially equivalent to the annuitant's accumulated contributions in the plan plus an equal amount paid by the employer and commences on application on or after the sixty-second birthday of the annuitant. The deferred annuity is not a retirement benefit and annuitants are not entitled to receive any amount prescribed by section 38-887, 38-888, 38-904 or 38-906.

B. This section does not apply to a member who becomes a member of the plan on or after January 1, 2012 and before July 1, 2018. Such a person who attains a normal retirement date is eligible for retirement and a retirement benefit even if the member terminates employment with an employer before the age requirement for normal retirement if the member attains the service requirement for normal retirement.

#### Section 38-912. Civil liability; restitution or payment of fine; forfeiture of benefits; violation; classification; offset of benefits

A. A person who defrauds the plan or who takes, converts, steals or embezzles monies owned by or from the plan and who fails or refuses to return the monies to the plan on the board's written request is subject to civil suit by the plan in the superior court in Maricopa county.  On entry of an order finding the person has defrauded the plan or taken, converted, stolen or embezzled monies owned by or from the plan, the court shall enter an order against that person and for the plan awarding the plan all of its costs and expenses of any kind, including attorney fees, that were necessary to successfully prosecute the action.  The court shall also grant the plan a judicial lien on all of the nonexempt property of the person against whom judgment is entered pursuant to this subsection in an amount equal to all amounts awarded to the plan, plus interest at the rate prescribed by section 44-1201, until all amounts owed are paid to the plan.

B. If a member is convicted of, or discharged because of, theft, embezzlement, fraud or misappropriation of an employer's property or property under the control of the employer, the member is subject to restitution and fines imposed by a court of competent jurisdiction.  The court may order the restitution or fines to be paid from any payments otherwise payable to the member from the plan.

C. A person who knowingly makes any false statement or who falsifies or permits to be falsified any record of the plan with an intent to defraud the plan is guilty of a class 5 felony. If any change or error in the records results in any member or beneficiary receiving from the plan more or less than the member or beneficiary would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the local board shall correct the error, and as far as practicable shall adjust the payments in a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member or beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.  If a member is convicted of a crime pursuant to this subsection, section 13-713 applies.

D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the board may offset against any benefits otherwise payable by the plan to a member or survivor any court ordered amounts awarded to the board and plan and assessed against the member or survivor.

C. A supplemental defined contribution plan shall be designed to be a qualified governmental plan under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code.  The legislature intends that a supplemental defined contribution plan is a qualified plan under section 401 of the internal revenue code, as amended, or successor provisions of law, and that a plan is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the internal revenue code.  The board or employer may adopt any additional provisions to a plan that are necessary to fulfill this intent.

D. Although designated as employee contributions, all employee contributions made to a plan shall be picked up and paid by the employer in lieu of contributions by the employee. The contributions picked up by an employer may be made through a reduction in the employee's compensation or an offset against future compensation increases, or a combination of both. An employee participating in a plan does not have the option of choosing to receive the contributed amounts directly instead of the employer paying the amounts to the plan.

#### Section 38-953. Supplemental option

A. A supplemental defined contribution plan is in addition to and does not replace an employee's existing state defined benefit retirement plan.

B. Except as provided in subsection C, any contributing member of an eligible group that establishes a supplemental defined contribution plan as authorized by this article may participate in the supplemental defined contribution plan.  Participation in any plan established by an eligible group authorizes the member's employer to make reductions or deductions in the member's compensation.  The employer shall submit any reports required by the plan.  Any compensation deferred under the plan shall be included as regular compensation or compensation for the purpose of computing the retirement and pension benefits earned by any employee participating in the plan.

C. If the Arizona state retirement system establishes a supplemental defined contribution plan and an employer member of the Arizona state retirement system elects to participate in the supplemental defined contribution plan, any employee member of the employer who meets the eligibility requirements that are prescribed by the board for participation in the supplemental defined contribution plan and that are selected by the member's employer may participate in the supplemental defined contribution plan.

D. An employee shall make an election to participate in a supplemental defined contribution plan within two years after the employee first meets the eligibility requirements to participate in the plan.  An election to participate in a plan is irrevocable and continues for the remainder of the employee's employment with the employer.

E. If an employee elects to participate in a plan pursuant to this section, the employee shall contribute a prescribed amount of the employee's gross compensation, which shall be a percentage of the employee's gross compensation, a fixed dollar amount, an amount prescribed in the plan or some other definitive amount that may not be modified or revoked by the employee. As the plan prescribes, an employer may annually increase or decrease the employee contributions in increments of one per cent up to the maximum allowed by law or the employee may make a one-time irrevocable election of the employee's contribution amount.  An employee is not required to contribute under this subsection in order to qualify for an employer match under subsection F or G. The employer match may accrue from any program established by the employer.

F. An employer may elect to match the contributions made by the employee to the supplemental defined contribution plan at a rate determined by the employer.  The employer shall pay this amount to the supplemental defined contribution plan in which the employee participates.

G. An employer may elect to match the contributions made by the employee to any other program established by the employer under the internal revenue code, including any plan established under internal revenue code section 401(a), 403(b) or 457, at a rate determined by the employer.  The employee shall determine whether the employer pays the matching contribution to the 401(a), 403(b), or 457 plan in which the employee participates, to the supplemental defined contribution plan in which the employee participates or to any other plan established by the employer.

H. The rate of the employer match under subsection F or G shall be determined at the beginning of that employer's budget cycle and shall terminate at the end of that budget cycle.  If an employer elects to match under subsection F or G, the employer shall make the contributions.

 

#### Section 38-954. Vesting

A. Employee contributions and earnings on employee contributions are immediately vested.

B. Employer matching contributions, if any, and the earnings on employer matching contributions are vested and the employee is entitled to receive employer matching contributions and earnings on those contributions as follows:

1. If the employee has less than one year of credited service in an eligible group, zero per cent.

(Rpld. 10/1/25)

 

A. This state or a political subdivision of this state that employs a public safety employee on a full-time basis shall establish a supplemental benefits plan for a public safety employee who is injured while on duty to the extent that the public safety employee cannot perform the functions of the position. To become eligible for the supplemental benefits plan, the public safety employee must be receiving workers' compensation benefits pursuant to title 23, chapter 6. This state or a political subdivision of this state shall design the supplemental benefits plan so that, with the addition of other benefits being paid to the public safety employee pursuant to title 23, chapter 6, the public safety employee will receive approximately the identical base salary less the amount of taxes the public safety employee was paying.

B. If a public safety employee is accepted into the supplemental benefits plan, the public safety employee's employer shall continue to pay the employer portion of the health care benefits that was being paid to the public safety employee on the date of the employee's injury.

C. If a public safety employee is accepted into the supplemental benefits plan, the public safety employee's employer shall pay the employee contribution to the public safety personnel retirement system or corrections officer retirement plan, as applicable, and shall continue to pay the employer contribution to the respective retirement system or plan. The public safety employee is entitled to accrue credited service for the period of time enrolled in the supplemental benefits plan.

D. A public safety employee who is eligible for the supplemental benefits plan shall apply for benefits to this state or a political subdivision of this state. This state or a political subdivision of this state, on an individual basis, shall determine if the public safety employee is entitled to the benefits in the plan. This state or a political subdivision of this state may establish injury standards for eligibility into the plan that may include the exclusion of a public safety employee whose injury is a result of the public safety employee's gross negligence, or any other condition that this state or the political subdivision chooses to consider within the plan.

E. A public safety employee who is accepted into the plan shall comply with all risk management requirements, including evaluation for light duty options and rehabilitation programs. If a public safety employee fails to comply with risk management decisions, the public safety employee's participation in the supplemental benefits plan will be terminated. The public safety employee who is accepted into the plan is responsible for the public safety employee's portion of the health care benefit costs the public safety employee was paying on the date of the injury. The public safety employee remains responsible for any elective health care plan deductions, health related optional deductions or optional life insurance deductions.

F. If a public safety employee is accepted into the supplemental benefits plan, the public safety employee shall not accrue any additional sick or annual leave and any sick or annual leave amount on the public safety employee's account shall not be decreased while the public safety employee is participating in the plan.

G. A public safety employee who is accepted into the supplemental benefits plan is not precluded from disciplinary action, including termination of employment, pursuant to chapter 8 of this title or any agreements that supplant, revise or otherwise alter the provisions of this title, including preexisting agreements between the employer and the public safety employee's lawful representative association.

H. This section shall not supersede any plan or policy that provides a greater benefit being offered by this state or a political subdivision of this state to a public safety employee who is injured while on duty. This state or a political subdivision of this state shall offer the supplemental benefits plan for an initial six-month period.  This state or the political subdivision may determine if the plan shall be extended, on an individual basis, an additional six months, for a maximum of one year.

I. State employee appeals for denials for supplemental benefits are exempt from the hearing process set forth in title 41, chapter 6, article 10. For state employees exercising appeals for denial of supplemental benefits, the department of administration may establish an alternative appeal hearing process, including the requirement that parties agree to arbitration heard by the industrial commission pursuant to section 23-107, or an alternative procedure established by the Arizona department of administration. If the department of administration establishes an alternative hearing process for the denial of claims for supplemental benefits, the department may contract with another government agency or with a third party to conduct hearings of appeals pursuant to section 38-961. The department may specify by rule or administrative policy the scope of the program and the alternative hearing procedures.

J. The department of administration shall report by March 1 each year on the overall claim, appeal and payment history for state employee claims and appeals made pursuant to this section during the prior year.  The report shall include claims made and claims resolved.

K. For the purposes of this section:

A. In any appeal of a disciplinary action by a law enforcement officer, the parties shall cooperate with each other, act in good faith and exchange copies of all relevant documents and a list of all witnesses pursuant to the following time periods and requirements:

1. Within fourteen calendar days after the employer's receipt of a written request from the law enforcement officer for a copy of the investigative file that is accompanied by a copy of the filed notice of appeal, the employer shall provide a complete copy of the investigative file as well as the names and contact information for all persons interviewed during the course of the investigation.

2. Not later than fourteen calendar days before the appeal hearing, the parties shall produce and serve on every party the following information:

(a) The name of each witness whom the disclosing party expects to call at the appeal hearing, with a designation of the subject matter on which each witness might be called to testify.  A witness may decline an interview.  The parties shall not interfere with any decision of a witness regarding whether to be interviewed. An employer shall not discipline, retaliate against or threaten to retaliate against any witness for agreeing to be interviewed or for testifying or providing evidence in the appeal.

3. The duty to disclose information continues to exist throughout the process and up to the end of the appeal process.

B. It is unlawful for a person to disseminate information that is disclosed pursuant to subsection A of this section to any person other than the parties to the appeal and their lawful representatives for purposes of the appeal of the disciplinary action.  This subsection does not prohibit the use of the information in the hearing or disclosure pursuant to title 39, chapter 1, article 2.

D. Failure to comply with the requirements of subsection A or B of this section shall result in the exclusion of the witness, evidence or testimony, unless the failure to comply is because of excusable neglect.

E. The employer or the law enforcement officer may seek a determination by the hearing officer, administrative law judge or appeals board hearing the appeal regarding any evidence that the employer or the law enforcement officer believes should not be disclosed pursuant to subsection A of this section because the risk of harm involved in disclosure outweighs any usefulness of the disclosure in the hearing.  In determining whether evidence will be disclosed, the hearing officer, administrative law judge or appeals board may perform an in camera review of the evidence and may disclose the material subject to any restriction on the disclosure, including the closing of the hearing or the sealing of the records, that the hearing officer, administrative law judge or appeals board finds necessary under the circumstances.

The supervisor or supervising body of the hearing officer or administrative law judge shall decide whether a showing of prejudice has been made.

G. The employer has the burden of proof in an appeal of a disciplinary action by a law enforcement officer.

The employer or person acting on behalf of the employer shall state the reason for the amendment, modification, rejection or reversal.

J. Notwithstanding chapter 3, article 3.1 of this title, all hearings pursuant to this section shall be open to the public. Executive sessions allowed pursuant to section 38-431.03 shall be limited to legal advice to a personnel appeals board or for deliberations.

Retroactive compensation may be reduced:

1. If there is undue delay in setting a hearing date caused by the law enforcement officer or the law enforcement officer's representative.

L. The hearing officer, administrative law judge or appeals board shall state in every finding of disciplinary action whether or not just cause existed for the disciplinary action.

M. The hearing officer, administrative law judge or appeals board shall document in the record those circumstances where the hearing officer, administrative law judge or appeals board determines that a party has clearly violated a party's obligation under this section.

N. Immediately after a law enforcement officer receives the final disposition of an appeal of a disciplinary action, the administrative law judge, hearing officer or presiding authority shall provide a final disposition report that includes the final decision and any amended findings of fact to the law enforcement agency that initiated or imposed the discipline.

O. A law enforcement agency that receives a final disposition report shall include the final disposition report in the agency's original investigation record.

B. If a law enforcement officer is demoted or terminated by an employer or a person acting on behalf of an employer where there is no hearing officer, administrative law judge or appeals board to review the demotion or termination, the law enforcement officer may bring an action in superior court to review the agency's file.  If the court finds from a review of the file that there was no just cause for the demotion or termination, the officer is entitled to a hearing de novo on the demotion or termination.

A.

The investigation is considered complete on the date the employee is served with the notice of discipline or the notice of findings.  The employer may continue the investigation beyond the one hundred eighty-calendar-day period only if it is demonstrated that additional time is necessary to obtain or review evidence.  Before the employer exceeds the one hundred eighty-calendar-day limit, the employer shall provide the employee with a written explanation of the reasons the investigation continued beyond one hundred eighty calendar days. Except as provided in subsection D, paragraph 6 of this section, any extension may not exceed one hundred eighty calendar days. Subject to the conditions in subsection B of this section, if the investigation is not complete at the conclusion of the extension period, the matter shall be dismissed.

B.

C. If, in the course of an investigation involving multiple law enforcement officers, evidence is discovered that exonerates the law enforcement officer or fails to sustain any wrongdoing, the employer shall issue the individual law enforcement officer a notice of findings. The employer may continue to order the law enforcement officer not to discuss or disclose any information regarding the investigation except to the law enforcement officer's legal counsel, spouse, representative or medical provider.

The allegation regarding any act, omission or other misconduct may be sustained, and the employee's record shall reflect that the allegation was sustained but no discipline was administered due to the finding of the hearing officer, administrative law judge or appeals board that the employer did not make a good faith effort to complete the investigation in one hundred eighty calendar days or any extension. The sustained discipline may be considered when determining discipline in any future sustained misconduct allegation. If the employer determines that disciplinary action is appropriate, the employer shall complete the employer's investigation and give notice in writing to the law enforcement officer of the employer's intent to proceed with disciplinary action, along with a proposal of the specific action sought, including length of suspension, if applicable.

I. A probation officer who prevails in an appeal where a termination has been reversed may be awarded retroactive compensation from the date of the officer's separation to the date of reinstatement. The employer may exclude any penalties deemed appropriate by the reviewing authority from the retroactive payment.

 

#### Section 38-1137. Confidentiality of records
