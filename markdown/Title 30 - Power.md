#### Section 30-126. Designation of transmission lines upon which uniform transmission voltage rate applicable

The authority shall designate certain sections of main transmission lines and facilities in the state for delivery of Colorado river power, including lines to be constructed or acquired by the authority and any transmission lines and facilities which may become available through the United States or an agency thereof, or other public or private sources, to the extent that the authority may be able to arrange for the use of the lines and facilities, as to which sections a uniform rate for power at transmission voltage shall also be made applicable. The sections shall initially include all portions of the lines between the points of generation on the Colorado river and distribution centers where substantial power loads exist as established by the authority.

#### Section 30-127. Uniform transmission voltage rate; wholesale power rates; limitations

A. The uniform transmission voltage rate shall include proper components of cost for power delivered over the sections of line designated under the provisions of section 30-126 at high voltage transmission levels, and power shall be sold at the uniform transmission voltage rate for transmission voltage delivery at any point on such sections of line.  Power may be sold at the low voltage side of substations located on such sections of line at rates covering the uniform transmission voltage rate plus proper added cost components for low voltage delivery, and at locations served by extensions from such sections of line at rates covering the uniform transmission voltage rate plus proper added cost components for delivery over the extensions and related facilities. The authority shall be under no obligation to construct or furnish any substations or other facilities for delivery on the low voltage side or any extensions from the main transmission lines.

B. The application of the uniform transmission voltage rate may from time to time be extended to other sections of the main transmission lines and to sections of high voltage transmission lines subsequently constructed when the application of the rate to the other sections of line and subsequently constructed lines will not result in a material increase in the rate, but no increase from this cause shall apply to or affect the rates in existing contracts.

C. If electric power is purchased by the authority directly from facilities owned and operated by the United States, an agency thereof, or other public or private sources, at a cost to the authority not consistent with the uniform transmission voltage rate, the rates for the power to purchasers from the authority shall be based upon the cost of power to the authority together with all additional cost components pertinent thereto.

D. Wholesale power rates set forth in any power contract for sale of power by the authority shall be limited as to modifications upward to the extent of variations in the cost of power to the authority in its power purchase contracts, or variations in the actual costs, including operating costs, to the authority of the facilities which shall be specified in the power contract to be taken into account in determining costs.

E. Contracts or agreements for sale by the authority of electric power and energy at wholesale shall recognize all applicable provisions of this chapter and may be executed for such period as the authority deems necessary, but if such contracts or agreements are made for a period exceeding twenty years they shall be made subject to termination upon reasonable notice by the authority at any time after the initial twenty year period.

F. No revenue bond issued by the authority, or agreement of the authority with respect thereto, shall in any respect impair, modify or change the provisions of any contract of the authority for the sale of electrical energy entered into pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

G. If secondary, dump, off-peak, or emergency energy becomes available to the authority from Colorado river developments, or other public or private sources, it may be purchased and resold by the authority to the extent of transmission facilities available, at rates which will be adequate to cover the costs of delivering such energy, and under terms and conditions suited to the uses which may be made of the energy.
