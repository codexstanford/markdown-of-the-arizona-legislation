In adopting rules pursuant to this subsection, the director shall incorporate the criteria set forth in section 49-282.06, subsection A and shall ensure that the nuisance is abated so that it will not recur.

#### Section 49-142. Abatement order; hearing; injunction

A. If the director has reasonable cause to believe from information furnished to the director or from the director's own investigation that a person is maintaining an environmental nuisance, the director may serve, by certified mail, an abatement order on the person requiring the person to abate the nuisance. If the person fails or refuses to comply with the order within the time specified in the order or if after reasonable attempts the director is unable to serve the order, the director may abate the nuisance at the department's expense. The director shall be entitled to recover the reasonable costs of abatement incurred in accordance with any terms of the order that have been upheld after all rights to appeal or judicial review have been exhausted or waived.

B. An abatement order issued pursuant to this section becomes final unless within thirty days after receipt of the order an appeal is made pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

C. If a person fails or refuses to comply with an abatement order issued under this section or if the director has reason to believe that a person is creating an actual or potential endangerment to the public health or environment because of acts performed in violation of this article or a rule applicable to any environmental nuisance described in section 49-141, the director may file an action in superior court in the county in which the violation occurred or in any county in which the department maintains an office to restrain and enjoin the person from further violations, to compel compliance with an order or to abate an environmental nuisance. The court shall proceed as in other actions for injunctions.

#### Section 49-143. Abatement of environmental nuisances

If an environmental nuisance exists on private property, the county board of health, the local health or environmental department or the department of environmental quality may order the owner or occupant to remove the nuisance within twenty-four hours at the expense of the owner or occupant. The order may be given to the owner or occupant personally or left at the residence of the owner or occupant. If the owner or occupant fails or refuses to comply with the order, the board or department shall cause the nuisance to be removed, and the owner, occupant or other person who caused the nuisance shall pay the expenses of removal.

 

#### Section 49-144. Right to enter premises for inspection or abatement

If a county board of health or a local health or environmental department deems it necessary to enter any building, structure or other property within its jurisdiction for the purpose of examining, destroying, removing or preventing an environmental nuisance and is refused entrance, any member of the board or officer of the department may make a complaint of the refusal under oath to a justice of the peace. The justice of the peace shall issue a warrant directing the sheriff or other peace officer accompanied by and under the direction of at least one member of the board or department to examine, destroy, remove or prevent, between the hours of sunrise and sunset, the environmental nuisance.

 

### Article 4 - Remediation Standards

#### Section 49-151. Definitions

In this article, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Engineering control" means a remediation method such as a barrier or cap that is used to prevent or minimize exposure to contaminants and that includes technologies that reduce the mobility or migration of contaminants.

2. "Institutional control" means a legal or administrative tool or action taken to reduce the potential for exposure to contaminants.

3. "Nonresidential use" means those uses of property other than residential uses.

4. "Owner" means all persons or entities that currently hold fee title to property other than as security for an obligation.  On transfer of fee title of an affected property and after notice is provided pursuant to section 49-152.01, subsection C, the successor owner is the owner for purposes of this article and assumes all of the obligations of an owner pursuant to this article and the person who transferred title is no longer responsible for those obligations except as prescribed in section 49-152.01, subsection C.

5. "Remediation" means either:

(a) The treatment or removal of contaminated environmental media to meet predetermined risk levels or site specific risk levels.

(b) Environmental media that meet predetermined risk levels or site specific risk levels as determined by a risk assessment.

6. "Residential use" means those uses of remediated property where natural persons are reasonably expected to be in frequent, repeated contact with soil.

#### Section 49-152. Soil remediation standards; restrictions on property use

A. Notwithstanding any other remediation levels established under this title, the director shall approve remediation levels calculated in accordance with this subsection and shall accomplish the following for remediation of contaminated soil to protect public health and the environment in accordance with the applicable provisions of this title and section 33-434.01:

1. Establish predetermined risk based standards by rule. At a minimum, separate standards shall be established for residential and nonresidential exposure assumptions. Until risk based remediation standards are formally established by rule, the director shall establish interim standards adopting:

(a) The Arizona health based guidance levels developed by the department of health services to include a health based standard for total petroleum hydrocarbons as the standards for residential uses.

(b) The guidance levels in subdivision (a) of this paragraph modified to reflect the United States environmental protection agency published assumptions for exposures that are not residential as the standards for nonresidential uses. The initial adoption of these interim standards shall be effective by December 15, 1995 and shall be deemed emergency rules pursuant to section 41-1026.

2. Issue guidance on methods for calculating case-by-case, site specific risk based remediation levels in accordance with risk assessment methodologies that are accepted in the scientific community and shall not preclude the use of newly developed risk assessment methodologies that are accepted in the scientific community.

B. The owner of a property may elect to remediate the property to meet a site specific residential or nonresidential risk based remediation standard or a predetermined residential or nonresidential risk based remediation standard. The property is suitable for unrestricted use if it has been remediated without the use of engineering or institutional controls to meet either of the following:

1. The predetermined residential risk based remediation standard.

2. A site specific risk based hazard index equal to or less than one or a risk of carcinogenic health effects that is less than or equal to the range of risk levels set forth in 40 Code of Federal Regulations 430(e)(2)(i)(A)(2), based on residential exposure.

C. If the owner has elected to use an engineering or institutional control to meet the standards prescribed in subsection B of this section, or if the owner has elected to leave contamination on the property that exceeds the applicable residential standard for the property at a site remediated under programs, settlements or orders administered by the department under this title, the owner shall record in each county where the property is located an institutional control that consists of a restrictive covenant that is labeled "declaration of environmental use restriction" pertaining to the area of the property necessary to protect the public health and the environment. A person who is conducting a remedial action, remediation, corrective action or response action that requires an institutional or engineering control and who is not the owner of the property shall obtain written consent from the owner before implementing the institutional control or constructing the engineering control. On implementation of the institutional or engineering control, the owner shall record a declaration of environmental use restriction in each county where the property is located. If the institutional control or engineering control will affect right-of-way that is owned, maintained or controlled by a public entity for public benefit, the person shall also obtain the public entity's written consent before implementing the institutional control or constructing the engineering control. The declaration of environmental use restriction shall limit by legal description:

1. The area of the property where the institutional control or engineering control shall be maintained.

2. The area of the property to be restricted to nonresidential use, because contamination remains on the property above the standards prescribed in subsection B, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section.

D. At the written request of the owner of property that is subject to a declaration of environmental use restriction, the director shall determine whether release or modification of the declaration of environmental use restriction is appropriate. If a release has been requested, the director shall make this determination within sixty days after the date of the property owner's request. If the director determines that release of the declaration of environmental use restriction is appropriate, the director shall record in each county where the property is located a notice releasing the declaration of environmental use restriction. The declaration of environmental use restriction is perpetual unless released pursuant to this section. The director shall determine that release of a declaration of environmental use restriction is appropriate if the property has been remediated, without the use of institutional controls or engineering controls, to either:

1. Meet predetermined risk based remedial standards for residential exposure assumptions.

2. Present a risk based hazard index equal to or less than one from noncancer health effects and a risk estimate of carcinogenic health effects equal to or less than the range of risk levels set forth in 40 Code of Federal Regulations 430(e)(2)(i)(A)(2).

E. The department shall establish a repository in the department listing sites remediated under programs administered by the department under this title. The repository shall include the name and address of the owner of the property, when the remediation was conducted, the legal description and street address of the property, the applicability of section 33-434.01, the type of financial assurance mechanism that is being used, if applicable, and a description of the purpose of the declaration of environmental use restriction.

F. When recorded, an owner's declaration of environmental use restriction under subsection B of this section is a covenant that runs with and burdens the property, binds the owner and the owner's heirs, successors and assigns and inures to the benefit of the department and the state.  If notice of the declaration of environmental use restriction that includes a specific description of the area of the property that is subject to the declaration of environmental use restriction is contained in the repository maintained by the department pursuant to subsection E of this section, a declaration of environmental use restriction may not be extinguished, limited or impaired through any of the following:

1. Request a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction to mitigate or prevent the endangerment.

2. Access the financial assurance mechanism pursuant to section 49-152.01, subsection B to mitigate or prevent the endangerment.  An action that is filed pursuant to this subsection shall have precedence over all other matters pending before the court.

G. An owner who fails to comply with a final order issued pursuant to subsection A of this section is subject to a civil penalty up to one thousand dollars per day for each day of noncompliance.  The total civil penalties that may be imposed on an owner pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars for each final order that is violated. At the request of the director the attorney general shall file an action in superior court to recover penalties provided in this section.  In determining the amount of a civil penalty, the court shall consider the following factors:

1. The level of actual or potential threat to public health or the environment posed by the owner’s failure to comply with the order.

2. Whether the reason for the owner’s failure to comply with the order, if known, was beyond the reasonable control of the owner.

3. Whether the owner made any good faith attempt to comply with the order.

4. The financial status of the owner.

5. The economic benefit, if any, that results from the violation.

6. Other matters as justice may require.

 

#### Section 49-158. Restrictions on property use; enforcement of engineering and institutional controls

A. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this title, if a remedial action, remediation or corrective action performed pursuant to this title or a response action performed pursuant to CERCLA as defined in section 49-201 includes an institutional control or an engineering control and the remedial action, remediation, corrective action or response action is not subject to section 49-152, the owner of the property on which the institutional control or engineering control is located, on implementation of the institutional control or on construction of the engineering control, shall record in each county where the property is located a restrictive covenant that is labeled "declaration of environmental use restriction".  A person who is conducting a remedial action, remediation, corrective action or response action that requires an institutional or engineering control and who is not the owner of the property shall obtain written consent from the owner before implementing the institutional control or constructing the engineering control.  On implementation of the institutional control or construction of the engineering control, the owner shall record a declaration of environmental use restriction in each county where the property is located.  If the institutional control or engineering control will affect right-of-way that is owned, maintained or controlled by a public entity for public benefit, the person shall also obtain the public entity's written consent before implementing the institutional control or constructing the engineering control.  The declaration of environmental use restriction shall limit by legal description the area of the property where the institutional control or engineering control shall be maintained.

B. When recorded, an owner’s declaration of environmental use restriction under subsection A of this section is a covenant that runs with and burdens the property, binds the owner and the owner's heirs, successors and assigns and inures to the benefit of the department and the state.  If notice of the declaration of environmental use restriction that includes a specific description of the area of the property that is subject to the declaration of environmental use restriction is contained in the repository maintained by the department pursuant to section 49-152, subsection E, a declaration of environmental use restriction may not be extinguished, limited or impaired through any of the following:

#### Section 49-222. Water quality standards for WOTUS

A. Standards for the quality of WOTUS shall assure water quality, if attainable, which provides for protecting the public health and welfare, and shall enhance the quality of water taking into consideration its use and value for public water supplies, the propagation of fish and wildlife and recreational, agricultural, industrial and other purposes including navigation.

B. The director shall adopt standards for the quality of all WOTUS that establish numeric limitations on the concentrations of each of the toxic pollutants listed by the administrator pursuant to section 307 of the clean water act (33 United States Code section 1317).

C. In setting numeric standards for the quality of WOTUS, the director may consider the effect of local water quality characteristics on the toxicity of specific pollutants and the varying sensitivities of local affected aquatic populations to such pollutants, and the extent to which the natural flow of the stream is intermittent or ephemeral, as a result of which the instream flow consists mostly of treated wastewater effluent, except that such standards shall not, in any event, be inconsistent with the clean water act. In applying such standards the director may establish appropriate mixing zones.

#### Section 49-223. Aquifer water quality standards

A. Primary drinking water maximum contaminant levels established by the administrator before August 13, 1986 are adopted as drinking water aquifer water quality standards. The director may only adopt additional aquifer water quality standards by rule. Within one year after the administrator establishes additional primary drinking water maximum contaminant levels, the director shall open a rule making docket pursuant to section 41-1021 for adoption of those maximum contaminant levels as drinking water aquifer water quality standards. If substantial opposition is demonstrated in the rule making docket regarding a particular constituent, the director may adopt for that constituent the maximum contaminant level as a drinking water aquifer water quality standard upon making a finding that this level is appropriate for adoption in Arizona as an aquifer water quality standard. In making this finding, the director shall consider whether the assumptions about technologies, costs, sampling and analytical methodologies and public health risk reduction used by the administrator in developing and implementing the maximum contaminant level are appropriate for establishing a drinking water aquifer water quality standard. For purposes of this subsection "substantial opposition" means information submitted to the director that explains with reasonable specificity why the maximum contaminant level is not appropriate as an aquifer water quality standard.

B. The director may adopt by rule numeric drinking water aquifer water quality standards for pollutants for which the administrator has not established primary drinking water maximum contaminant levels or for which a maximum contaminant level has been established but the director has determined it to be inappropriate as an aquifer water quality standard pursuant to subsection A of this section. These standards shall be based on the protection of human health. In establishing numeric drinking water aquifer water quality standards, the director shall rely on technical protocols appropriate for the development of aquifer water quality standards and shall base the standards on credible medical and toxicological evidence that has been subjected to peer review.

C. Any person may petition the director to adopt a numeric drinking water aquifer quality standard for any pollutant for which no drinking water aquifer quality standard exists. The director shall grant the petition and institute rule making proceedings adopting a numeric standard as provided under subsection B of this section within one hundred eighty days if the petition shows that the pollutant is a toxic pollutant, that the pollutant has been, or may in the future be, detected in any of the state's drinking water aquifers, and that there exists technical information on which a numeric standard might reasonably be based. Within one year of the commencement of the rule making proceeding, the director shall either adopt a numeric standard or make and publish a finding that, pursuant to subsection B of this section, the development of a numeric standard is not possible. The decision to not adopt a numeric standard shall, for purposes of judicial review, be treated in the same manner as a rule adopted pursuant to title 41, chapter 6.

D. For purposes of assessing compliance with each aquifer water quality standard adopted pursuant to this section, the director shall for purposes of articles 3 and 4 of this chapter, and may for purposes of other provisions of this title, identify sampling and analytical protocols appropriate for detecting and measuring the pollutant in the aquifers in the state.

E. Within one year from the reclassification of an aquifer to a non-drinking water status, pursuant to section 49-224, the director shall adopt water quality standards for that aquifer. For any pollutants which were not the basis for the reclassification, the applicable standard shall be identical with the standard for those pollutants adopted pursuant to subsections A and B of this section. For any pollutants which were the basis for reclassification, the standard shall be sufficient to achieve the purpose for which the aquifer was reclassified but shall minimize unnecessary degradation of the aquifer by taking into consideration the potential long-term uses of the aquifer and the short-term and long-term benefits of the activities resulting in discharges into the aquifer.

F. The director shall adopt water quality standards for an aquifer for which a petition has been submitted pursuant to section 49-224, subsection D sufficient to achieve the non-drinking water use for which that aquifer was classified, taking into consideration the potential long-term uses of that aquifer and the short-term and long-term benefits of the discharging activities creating that aquifer.

G. In any action pursuant to this title, aquifer water quality protection provisions, including monitoring requirements, may be imposed only for pollutants for which aquifer water quality standards have been established that are likely to be present in a discharge. Indicator parameters and quality assurance parameters appropriate for such pollutants also may be specified.

#### Section 49-224. Aquifer identification, classification and reclassification

A. Not later than June 30, 1987 the director shall, by rule, identify and define the boundaries of all aquifers in this state utilizing, to the maximum extent possible, data available from the department of water resources.

B. All aquifers in this state identified and defined under subsection A of this section and any other aquifers subsequently discovered, identified and defined shall be classified for drinking water protected use unless the classification is changed in the manner provided in subsection C of this section.

C. The director, after consulting with the appropriate groundwater users advisory council established pursuant to title 45, chapter 2, article 2 if the aquifer is in an active management area, and a public hearing held pursuant to section 49-208, may change the classification of an aquifer or part of an aquifer for a protected use other than drinking water on making all of the following findings:

1. The identified aquifer or part of an aquifer is or will be so hydrologically isolated from other aquifers or other parts of the same aquifer that there is no reasonable probability that poorer quality water from the identified aquifer or part of an aquifer will cause or contribute to a violation of aquifer water quality standards in other aquifers or parts of the same aquifer.

2. Water from the identified aquifer or part of an aquifer is not being used as drinking water.

3. The short-term and long-term benefits to the public that would result from the degradation of the quality of the water in the identified aquifer or part of an aquifer below standards established pursuant to section 49-223, subsections A and B would significantly outweigh the short-term and long-term costs to the public of such degradation. Benefits and costs to be considered include economic, social and environmental.

D. Owners or operators of facilities whose discharges are solely responsible for creating an aquifer may petition the director for a classification of the aquifer for a non-drinking water use. The director may, by rule, classify that aquifer for a non-drinking water use upon making the findings prescribed in subsection C, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section.

E. The director shall provide for public participation in proceedings under this section pursuant to section 49-208 and shall hold at least one public hearing at a location as near as practicable to the aquifer proposed for reclassification.

#### Section 49-225. Water quality monitoring

A. The director of environmental quality, with the advice and cooperation of the Arizona department of agriculture and the director of water resources when appropriate, shall conduct ongoing monitoring of the waters of the state including the state's WOTUS and aquifers to detect the presence of new and existing pollutants, determine compliance with applicable water quality standards, determine the effectiveness of best management practices, agricultural best management practices and best available demonstrated control technologies, evaluate the effects of pollutants on public health or the environment and determine water quality trends.

B. The director shall maintain a statewide database of groundwater and soils sampled for pollutants. All agencies shall submit to the director, in a timely manner, the results of any groundwater or soils sampling for pollutants and the results of any groundwater or soils sampling that detect any pollutants.

C. The director shall establish minimum requirements and schedules for groundwater and soils sampling that will ensure precise and accurate results. The requirements shall be distributed to all agencies that conduct sampling. All sampling conducted shall meet the minimum requirements established pursuant to this subsection.

### Article 2.1 - Total Maximum Daily Loads

#### Section 49-231. Definitions

In this article, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Impaired water" means a protected surface water for which credible scientific data exists that satisfies the requirements of section 49-232, and that, in the case of WOTUS, demonstrates that the water should be identified pursuant to 33 United States Code section 1313(d) and the regulations implementing that statute.

2. "Surface water quality standard" means a standard adopted for a protected surface water pursuant to section 49-221 and, in the case of WOTUS, pursuant to section 49-222.

3. "TMDL implementation plan" means a written strategy to implement a total maximum daily load that is developed for an impaired water.  TMDL implementation plans may rely on any combination of the following components that the department determines will result in achieving and maintaining compliance with applicable surface water quality standards in the most cost-effective and equitable manner:

(a) Permit limitations.

(b) Best management practices.

(c) Education and outreach efforts.

(d) Technical assistance.

(e) Cooperative agreements, voluntary measures and incentive-based programs.

(f) Load reductions resulting from other legally required programs or activities.

(g) Land management programs.

(h) Pollution prevention planning, waste minimization or pollutant trading agreements.

(i) Other measures deemed appropriate by the department.

4. "Total maximum daily load" means an estimation of the total amount of a pollutant from all sources that may be added to a water while still allowing the water to achieve and maintain applicable surface water quality standards. Each total maximum daily load shall include allocations for sources that contribute the pollutant to the water. Total maximum daily loads for WOTUS shall meet the requirements of section 303(d) of the clean water act (33 United States Code section 1313(d)) and regulations implementing that statute to achieve applicable surface water quality standards. Total maximum daily loads for non-WOTUS protected surface waters shall not be subject to review, approval or enforcement by the United States environmental protection agency.

 

#### Section 49-232. Lists of impaired waters; data requirements; rules

A. At least once every five years, the department shall prepare a list of impaired WOTUS to comply with section 303(d) of the clean water act (33 United States Code section 1313(d)).  The department shall provide public notice and allow for comment on a draft list of impaired WOTUS prior to its submission to the United States environmental protection agency. The department shall prepare written responses to comments received on the draft list. The department shall publish the list of impaired WOTUS that it plans to submit initially to the regional administrator and a summary of the responses to comments on the draft list in the Arizona administrative register at least forty-five days before submission of the list to the regional administrator.  Publication of the list in the Arizona administrative register is an appealable agency action pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10 that may be appealed by any party that submitted written comments on the draft list. If the department receives a notice of appeal of a listing pursuant to 1092.03 within forty-five days after the publication of the list in the Arizona administrative register, the department shall not include the challenged listing in its initial submission to the regional administrator. The department may subsequently submit the challenged listing to the regional administrator if the listing is upheld in the director’s final administrative decision pursuant to section 41-1092.08, or if the challenge to the listing is withdrawn prior to a final administrative decision.

B. On or before December 31, 2022 and at least once every five years thereafter, the department shall prepare a list of impaired non-WOTUS protected surface waters.  The department shall provide public notice and opportunity to comment on a draft list of impaired non-WOTUS protected surface waters prepared under this subsection. The department shall prepare written responses to comments received on the draft list.  The department shall publish the list of impaired non-WOTUS protected surface waters and a summary of the responses to comments on the draft list in the Arizona administrative register.  Publication of the list in the Arizona administrative register is an appealable agency action pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10 and may be appealed by any party that submitted written comments on the draft list.

C. In determining whether a water is impaired, the department shall consider only reasonably current credible and scientifically defensible data that the department has collected or has received from another source. Results of water sampling or other assessments of water quality, including physical or biological health, shall be considered credible and scientifically defensible data only if the department has determined all of the following:

1. Appropriate quality assurance and quality control procedures were followed and documented in collecting and analyzing the data.

2. The samples or analyses are representative of water quality conditions at the time the data was collected.

3. The data consists of an adequate number of samples based on the nature of the water in question and the parameters being analyzed.

4. The method of sampling and analysis, including analytical, statistical and modeling methods, is generally accepted and validated in the scientific community as appropriate for use in assessing the condition of the water.

D. The department shall adopt by rule the methodology to be used in identifying waters as impaired. The rules shall specify all of the following:

1. Minimum data requirements and quality assurance and quality control requirements that are consistent with subsection C of this section and that must be satisfied in order for the data to serve as the basis for listing and delisting decisions.

2. Appropriate sampling, analytical and scientific techniques that may be used in assessing whether a water is impaired.

3. Any statistical or modeling techniques that the department uses to assess or interpret data.

4. Criteria for including and removing waters from the list of impaired waters, including any implementation procedures developed pursuant to subsection G of this section.  The criteria for removing a water from the list of impaired waters shall not be any more stringent than the criteria for adding a water to that list.

E. In assessing whether a water is impaired, the department shall consider the data available in light of the nature of the water in question, including whether the water is an ephemeral water.  A water in which pollutant loadings from naturally occurring conditions alone are sufficient to cause a violation of applicable surface water quality standards shall not be listed as impaired.

F. If the department has adopted a numeric surface water quality standard for a pollutant and that standard is not being exceeded in a water, the department shall not list the water as impaired based on a conclusion that the pollutant causes a violation of a narrative or biological standard unless:

1. The department has determined that the numeric standard is insufficient to protect water quality.

2. The department has identified specific reasons that are appropriate for the water in question, that are based on generally accepted scientific principles and that support the department's determination.

G. Before listing a water as impaired based on a violation of a narrative or biological surface water quality standard and after providing an opportunity for public notice and comment, the department shall adopt implementation procedures that specifically identify the objective basis for determining that a violation of the narrative or biological criterion exists.  A total maximum daily load designed to achieve compliance with a narrative or biological surface water quality standard shall not be adopted until the implementation procedure for the narrative or biological surface water quality standard has been adopted.

H. On request, the department shall make available to the public data used to support the listing of a water as impaired and may charge a reasonable fee to persons requesting the data.

I. By January 1, 2002, the department shall review the list of waters identified as impaired as of January 1, 2000 to determine whether the data that supports the listing of those waters complies with this section.  If the data that supports a listing does not comply with this section, the listed water shall not be included on future lists submitted to the United States environmental protection agency pursuant to 33 United States Code section 1313(d) unless in the interim data that satisfies the requirements of this section has been collected or received by the department.

J. The department shall add a water to or remove a water from the list using the process described in subsection A or B of this section outside of the normal listing cycle if it collects or receives credible and scientifically defensible data that satisfies the requirements of this section and that demonstrates that the  current quality of the water is such that it should be removed from or added to the list.  A listed water may no longer warrant classification as impaired or an unlisted water may be identified as impaired if the applicable surface water quality standards, implementation procedures or designated uses have changed or if there is a change in water quality.

K. The director shall apply the rules adopted pursuant to subsection D of this section for identification of impaired waters to non-WOTUS protected surface waters until specifically changed by rule.  The director shall amend rules to update the impaired waters identification rules within one year after adopting surface water quality standards for non-WOTUS protected surface waters pursuant to section 49-221, subsection A, paragraph 2.

#### Section 49-233. Priority ranking and schedule

A. Each list developed by the department pursuant to section 49-232 shall contain a priority ranking of WOTUS identified as impaired and for which total maximum daily loads are required pursuant to section 49-234 and a schedule for the development of all required total maximum daily loads.

B. In the first list submitted to the United States environmental protection agency after July 18, 2000, the schedule shall be sufficient to ensure that all required total maximum daily loads will be developed within fifteen years after the date the list is approved by the environmental protection agency. Total maximum daily loads that are required to be developed for WOTUS that are included for the first time on subsequent lists shall be developed within fifteen years of the initial inclusion of the water on the list.

C. As part of the rulemaking prescribed by section 49-232, subsection D, the department shall identify the factors that it will use to prioritize WOTUS that require development of total maximum daily loads.  At a minimum and to the extent relevant data is available, the department shall consider the following factors in prioritizing WOTUS for development of total maximum daily loads:

1. The designated uses of the WOTUS.

2. The type and extent of risk from the impairment to human health or aquatic life.

3. The degree of public interest and support, or its lack.

4. The nature of the WOTUS, including whether it is an ephemeral, intermittent or effluent-dependent water.

5. The pollutants causing the impairment.

6. The severity, magnitude and duration of the violation of the applicable surface water quality standard.

7. The seasonal variation caused by natural events such as storms or weather patterns.

8. Existing treatment levels and management practices.

9. The availability of effective and economically feasible treatment techniques, management practices or other pollutant loading reduction measures.

10. The recreational and economic importance of the water.

11. The extent to which the impairment is caused by discharges or activities that have ceased.

12. The extent to which natural sources contribute to the impairment.

13. Whether the water is accorded special protection under federal or state water quality law.

14. Whether action that is taken or that is likely to be taken under other programs, including voluntary programs, is likely to make significant progress toward achieving applicable standards even if a total maximum daily load is not developed.

15. The time expected to be required to achieve compliance with applicable surface water quality standards.

16. The availability of documented, effective analytical tools for developing a total maximum daily load for the water with reasonable accuracy.

17. Department resources and programmatic needs.

#### Section 49-234. Total maximum daily loads; implementation plans

A. The department shall develop total maximum daily loads for those WOTUS listed as impaired pursuant to this article and for which total maximum daily loads are required to be adopted pursuant to 33 United States Code section 1313(d) and the regulations implementing that statute or that the department otherwise determines are required to restore an impaired water. The department may estimate total maximum daily loads for WOTUS not listed as impaired pursuant to this article to develop information to satisfy the requirements of 33 United States Code section 1313(d)(3) only after it has developed total maximum daily loads for all WOTUS identified as impaired pursuant to this article or if necessary to support permitting of new point source discharges.

B. In developing total maximum daily loads, the department shall use only statistical and modeling techniques that are properly validated and broadly accepted by the scientific community.  The modeling technique may vary based on the type of water and the quantity and quality of available data that meets the quality assurance and quality control requirements of section 49-232. The department may establish the statistical and modeling techniques in rules adopted pursuant to section 49-232, subsection D.

C. Each total maximum daily load shall:

1. Be based on data and methodologies that comply with section 49-232.

2. Be established at a level that will achieve and maintain compliance with applicable surface water quality standards.

3. Include a reasonable margin of safety that takes into account any lack of knowledge concerning the relationship between effluent limitations and water quality.  The margin of safety shall not be used as a substitute for adequate data when developing the total maximum daily load.

4. Account for seasonal variations that may include setting total maximum daily loads that apply on a seasonal basis.

D. For each impaired water, either of the following applies:

1. For each impaired WOTUS, the department shall prepare a draft estimate of the total amount of each pollutant that causes the impairment from all sources and that may be added to the WOTUS while still allowing the WOTUS to achieve and maintain applicable surface water quality standards.  In addition, the department shall determine draft allocations among the contributing sources that are sufficient to achieve the total loadings. The department shall provide public notice and allow for comment on each draft estimate and draft allocation and shall prepare written responses to comments received on the draft estimates and draft allocations. The department shall publish the determinations of total pollutant loadings that will not result in impairment and the draft allocations among the contributing sources that are sufficient to achieve the total loading that it intends to submit initially to the regional administrator, along with a summary of the responses to comments on the estimated loadings and allocations, in the Arizona administrative register at least forty-five days before submission of the loadings and allocations to the regional administrator. Notwithstanding this subsection, draft allocations shall be submitted to the regional administrator only if that submission is required by the rules that implement 33 United States Code section 1313(d).

2. For non-WOTUS impaired waters, the department may prepare a draft estimate of the total amount of each pollutant that causes the impairment from all sources and that may be added to the water while still allowing the water to achieve and maintain applicable surface water quality standards.  If the department chooses to prepare a draft estimate for a non-WOTUS impaired water, the department shall do all of the following:

(a) Determine draft allocations among contributing sources that are sufficient to achieve total loadings.

(b) Provide public notice and allow for comment on the draft estimates and draft allocations.

(c) Prepare written responses to comments received on the draft estimates and draft allocations.

(d) Publish the determinations of total pollutant loadings that will not result in impairment and the draft allocations among the contributing sources that are sufficient to achieve the total loading, along with a summary of the responses to comments on the estimated loadings and allocations, in the Arizona administrative register.

E. Publication of the loadings and allocations in the Arizona administrative register is an appealable agency action pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10 that may be appealed by any party that submitted written comments on the estimated loadings and allocations.  In the case of WOTUS, if the department receives a notice of appeal of a loading and allocation pursuant to section 41-1092.03 within forty-five days after the publication of the loading and allocations in the Arizona administrative register, the department shall not submit the challenged loading and allocations to the regional administrator until either the challenge to the loading and allocation is withdrawn or the director has made a final administrative decision pursuant to section 41-1092.08.

F. The department shall make reasonable and equitable allocations among sources when developing total maximum daily loads. At a minimum, the department shall consider the following factors in making allocations:

1. The environmental, economic and technological feasibility of achieving the allocation.

2. The cost and benefit associated with achieving the allocation.

3. Any pollutant loading reductions that are reasonably expected to be achieved as a result of other legally required actions or voluntary measures.

G. For each total maximum daily load, the department shall establish a TMDL implementation plan that explains how the allocations and any reductions in existing pollutant loadings will be achieved. Any reductions in loadings from nonpoint sources shall be achieved voluntarily. The department shall provide for public notice and comment on each TMDL implementation plan. Any sampling or monitoring components of a TMDL implementation plan shall comply with section 49-232.

H. Each TMDL implementation plan shall provide the time frame in which compliance with applicable surface water quality standards is expected to be achieved. The plan may include a phased process with interim targets for load reductions. Longer time frames are appropriate in situations involving multiple dischargers, technical, legal or economic barriers to achieving necessary load reductions, scientific uncertainty regarding data quality or modeling, significant loading from natural sources or significant loading resulting from discharges or activities that have already ceased.

I. For impaired waters that are impaired due in part to historical factors that are difficult to address, including contaminated sediments, the department shall consider those historical factors in determining allocations for existing point source discharges of the pollutant or pollutants that cause the impairment.  In developing total maximum daily loads for those waters, the department shall use a phased approach in which expected long-term loading reductions from the historical sources are considered in establishing short-term allocations for the point sources. While total maximum daily loads and TMDL implementation plans are being completed, any permits issued for the point sources are deemed consistent with this article if the permits require reasonable reductions in the discharges of the pollutants causing the impairment and are not required to include additional reductions if those reductions would not significantly contribute to attainment of surface water quality standards.

J. After a total maximum daily load and a TMDL implementation plan have been adopted for a protected surface water, the department shall review the status of the protected surface water at least once every five years to determine if compliance with applicable surface water quality standards has been achieved. If compliance with applicable surface water quality standards has not been achieved, the department shall evaluate whether modification of the total maximum daily load or TMDL implementation plan is required.

#### Section 49-235. Rules

The department shall adopt any rules necessary to implement this article.

#### Section 49-236. Report

By September 1, 2005, the department shall submit a report to the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives and the president of the senate detailing progress made under this program and shall provide a copy to the secretary of state and the department of library, archives and public records.  At a minimum, the report shall:

1. Evaluate the effectiveness of the total maximum daily load program and identify any recommended statutory changes to make the program more efficient, effective and equitable.

2. Assess the extent to which water quality problems that cannot be effectively addressed under the total maximum daily load program may be addressed under other federal or state laws.

3. Identify the number of appeals of department decisions under this article sought pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10 and the disposition of those appeals, and assess the impact of those appeals on the department’s ability to administer the program effectively.

 

#### Section 49-237. Impact of successful judicial appeal of Arizona department of environmental quality decision

If a person appeals to court and succeeds in overturning or modifying a final administrative decision of the director pursuant to this article in an appeal initiated pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10, within thirty days of the court’s decision the department shall take the steps necessary to implement the court’s decision, unless the director's decision that is overturned or modified was submitted to and approved by the regional administrator, in which case within thirty days of the court’s decision the department shall request that the regional administrator modify the approval to reflect the court’s decision.

### Article 3 - Aquifer Protection Permits

#### Section 49-241. Permit required to discharge

A. Unless otherwise provided by this article, any person who discharges or who owns or operates a facility that discharges shall obtain an aquifer protection permit from the director.

B. Unless exempted under section 49-250, or unless the director determines that the facility will be designed, constructed and operated so that there will be no migration of pollutants directly to the aquifer or to the vadose zone, the following are considered to be discharging facilities and shall be operated pursuant to either an individual permit or a general permit, including agricultural general permits, under this article:

1. Surface impoundments, including holding, storage settling, treatment or disposal pits, ponds and lagoons.

2. Solid waste disposal facilities except for mining overburden and wall rock that has not been and will not be subject to mine leaching operations.

3. Injection wells.

4. Land treatment facilities.

5. Facilities that add a pollutant to a salt dome formation, salt bed formation, dry well or underground cave or mine.

6. Mine tailings piles and ponds.

7. Mine leaching operations.

8. Underground water storage facilities.

9. Sewage treatment facilities, including on-site wastewater treatment facilities.

10. Wetlands designed and constructed to treat municipal and domestic wastewater for underground storage.

C. The director shall provide public notice and an opportunity for public comment on any request for a determination from the director under subsection B of this section that there will be no migration of pollutants from a facility. A public hearing may be held at the discretion of the director if sufficient public comment warrants a hearing. The director may inspect and may require reasonable conditions and appropriate monitoring and reporting requirements for a facility managing pollutants that are determined not to migrate under subsection B of this section.  The director may identify types of facilities, available technologies and technical criteria for facilities that will qualify for a determination. The director's determination may be revoked on evidence that pollutants have migrated from the facility.  The director may impose a review fee for a determination under subsection B of this section. Any issuance, denial or revocation of a determination may be appealed pursuant to section 49-323.

D. The director shall annually make the fee schedule for aquifer protection permit applications available to the public on request and on the department's website, and a list of the names and locations of the facilities that have filed applications for aquifer protection permits, with a description of the status of each application, is available to the public on request.

E. The director shall prescribe the procedures for aquifer protection permit applications and fee collection under this section. The director shall deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, all monies collected under this section in the water quality fee fund established by section 49-210 and may authorize expenditures from the fund, subject to legislative appropriation, to pay reasonable and necessary costs of processing and issuing permits and administering the registration program.

#### Section 49-241.01. Groundwater protection permit facilities; schedule; definition

A. The director shall complete the issuance or denial of aquifer protection permits or clean closure approval for all groundwater protection permit facilities on the following schedule:

1. By January 1, 2004, for all groundwater protection permits for nonmining facilities.

2. By January 1, 2006, for all groundwater protection permits for mining facilities.

B. The failure by the director to issue or deny an aquifer protection permit for a groundwater protection permit facility within the time prescribed by this section does not excuse a person from continuing to comply with all statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to that person's facility.

C. For purposes of this section, "groundwater protection permit facility" means either of the following:

1. A facility for which a groundwater quality protection permit was issued pursuant to the Arizona administrative code and for which an aquifer protection permit has never been issued.

2. A facility for which a notice of disposal was filed pursuant to the Arizona administrative code and for which an aquifer protection permit has never been issued.

#### Section 49-241.02. Aquifer protection permit program fees

A. The department shall adopt by rule fees to pay the expenses incurred in implementing the aquifer protection permit program. Monies collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the water quality fee fund established by section 49-210.

B. If the department contracts with a consultant under section 49-203, an applicant may request that the department expedite the application review by requesting that the department use the services of the consultant and agreeing to pay to the department the costs of the consultant's services regardless of the other provisions of this section.

#### Section 49-242. Procedural requirements for individual permits; annual registration of permittees; fee

A. The director shall prescribe by rule requirements for issuing, denying, suspending or modifying individual permits, including requirements for submitting notices, permit applications and any additional information necessary to determine whether an individual permit should be issued, and shall prescribe conditions and requirements for individual permits.

B. Each owner of an injection well, a land treatment facility, a dry well, an on-site wastewater treatment facility with a capacity of more than three thousand gallons per day, a recharge facility or a facility that discharges to protected surface waters to whom an individual or area-wide permit is issued shall register the permit with the director each year and pay an annual registration fee for each permit based on the total daily discharge of pollutants pursuant to subsection E of this section.

C. Each owner of a surface impoundment, a facility that adds a pollutant to a salt dome formation, salt bed formation, underground cave or mine, a mine tailings pile or pond, a mine leaching operation, a sewage or sludge pond or a wastewater treatment facility to whom an individual or area-wide permit is issued shall register the permit with the director each year and pay an annual registration fee for each permit based on the total daily influent of pollutants pursuant to subsection E of this section.

D. Pending the issuance of individual or area-wide aquifer protection permits, each owner of a facility that is prescribed in subsection B or C of this section that is operating on September 27, 1990 pursuant to the filing of a notice of disposal or a groundwater quality protection permit issued under title 36 shall register the notice of disposal or the permit with the director each year and shall pay an annual registration fee for each notice of disposal or permit based on the total daily influent or discharge of pollutants pursuant to subsection E of this section.

E. The director shall establish by rule an annual registration fee for facilities prescribed by subsections B, C and D of this section.  The fee shall be measured in part by the amount of discharge or influent per day from the facility.

F. For a site with more than one permit subject to the requirements of this section, the owner or operator of the facility at that site shall pay the annual registration fee prescribed pursuant to subsection E of this section based on the permit that covers the greatest gallons of discharge or influent per day plus one-half of the annual registration fee for gallons of discharge or influent for each additional permit.

G. The director shall prescribe the procedures to register the notice of disposal or permit and collect the fee under this section. The director shall deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, all monies collected under this section in the water quality fee fund established by section 49-210 and may authorize expenditures from the fund to pay the reasonable and necessary costs of administering the registration program.

#### Section 49-243. Information and criteria for issuing individual permit; definition

A. The director shall consider, and the applicant for an individual permit may be required to furnish with the application, the following information:

1. The design of the discharge facility. When formal as-built submittals are unavailable, the applicant shall provide sufficient documentation to allow evaluation of those elements of the facility affecting discharge pursuant to the demonstration required in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section.

2. A description of how the facility will be operated.

3. Existing and proposed pollutant control measures.

4. A hydrogeologic study defining and characterizing the discharge impact area, including the vadose zone.

5. The use of water from aquifers in the discharge impact area.

6. The existing quality of the water in the aquifers in the discharge impact area.

7. The characteristics of the pollutants discharged by the facility.

8. Closure strategy.

9. Any other relevant federal or state permits issued to the applicant.

10. Any other relevant information the director may require.

B. The director shall issue a permit to a person for a facility other than water storage at a storage facility pursuant to title 45, chapter 3.1 if the person demonstrates that either paragraphs 1 and 2 or paragraphs 1 and 3 of this subsection will be met:

1. That the facility will be so designed, constructed and operated as to ensure the greatest degree of discharge reduction achievable through application of the best available demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives, including, where practicable, a technology permitting no discharge of pollutants. In determining best available demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives, the director shall take into account any treatment process contributing to the discharge, site specific hydrologic and geologic characteristics and other environmental factors, the opportunity for water conservation or augmentation and economic impacts of the use of alternative technologies, processes or operating methods on an industry-wide basis.  A discharge reduction to an aquifer achievable solely by means of site specific characteristics does not, in itself, constitute compliance with this paragraph. The requirements of this paragraph for wetlands designed and constructed to treat municipal and domestic wastewater for underground storage pursuant to section 49-241, subsection B may be met by including seepage through the bottom of the facility if it is demonstrated that site characteristics can act to achieve performance levels established as the best available demonstrated control technology by the director.  In addition, the director shall consider the following factors for existing facilities:

(a) Toxicity, concentrations and quantities of discharge likely to reach an aquifer from various types of control technologies.

(b) The total costs of the application of the technology in relation to the discharge reduction to be achieved from such application.

(c) The age of equipment and facilities involved.

(d) The industrial and control process employed.

(e) The engineering aspects of the application of various types of control techniques.

(f) Process changes.

(g) Non-water quality environmental impacts.

(h) The extent to which water available for beneficial uses will be conserved by a particular type of control technology.

2. That pollutants discharged will in no event cause or contribute to a violation of aquifer water quality standards at the applicable point of compliance for the facility.

3. That no pollutants discharged will further degrade at the applicable point of compliance the quality of any aquifer that at the time of the issuance of the permit violates the aquifer quality standard for that pollutant.

C. An applicant shall satisfy the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section either by making a demonstration that the facility will meet the criteria of that paragraph or by agreeing to utilize the appropriate presumptive controls adopted by the director pursuant to section 49-243.01, subsection A.

D. In assessing technology, processes, operating methods and other alternatives for the purposes of this section, "practicable" means able to be reasonably done from the standpoint of technical practicality and, except for pollutants addressed in subsection I of this section, economically achievable on an industry-wide basis.

E. The determination of economic impact on an industry-wide basis for purposes of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section shall take into account differences in industry sectors, the type and size of the operation and the reasonableness of applying controls in an arid or semiarid setting.

F. Control measures designed to further reduce discharge may not be required if the director determines that site specific conditions, in conjunction with technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives are sufficient to meet the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section.

G. A discharging facility at an open pit mining operation shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section if the director determines that both of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The mine pit creates a passive containment that is sufficient to capture the pollutants discharged and that is hydrologically isolated to the extent that it does not allow pollutant migration from the capture zone.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "passive containment" means natural or engineered topographical, geological or hydrological control measures that can operate without continuous maintenance.  Monitoring and inspections to confirm performance of the passive containment do not constitute maintenance.

2. The discharging facility employs additional processes, operating methods or other alternatives to minimize discharge.

H. The director shall issue a permit to a person for water storage at a storage facility proposed under title 45, chapter 3.1 if the person demonstrates that the facility will be so designed, constructed and operated as to ensure that the project will not cause or contribute to the violation of any standard adopted pursuant to section 49-223 at the applicable point of compliance for the facility.

I. With respect to the following pollutants, the permit applicant for a new facility must meet the criteria of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section to limit discharges to the maximum extent practicable regardless of cost:

1. Any organic substance listed by the secretary of the department of health and human services pursuant to 42 United States Code section 241(b)(4), as known to be carcinogens or reasonably anticipated to be carcinogens.

2. Any organic substance listed in 40 Code of Federal Regulations 33(e), regardless of whether the substance is a waste subject to regulation under the resource conservation recovery act (P.L. 94-580; 90 Stat. 2795).

3. Any organic toxic pollutant that the director lists by rule after determining that minute amounts of that pollutant in drinking water will present a substantial short-term or long-term human health threat.

J. The director, by rule, may prescribe requirements for issuing a single permit applicable to all similar facilities under common ownership and located in a contiguous geographic area in lieu of an individual permit for each facility.

K. The director shall consider and may prescribe in the permit the following terms and conditions as necessary to ensure compliance with this article:

1. Monitoring requirements.

2. Record keeping and reporting requirements.

3. Contingency plan requirements.

4. Discharge limitations.

5. Compliance schedule requirements.

6. Closure requirements and, for a facility that cannot achieve clean closure, postclosure monitoring and maintenance requirements.

7. Alert levels that, when exceeded, may require adjustments of permit conditions or appropriate actions as are required by the contingency plans.

8. Such other terms and conditions as the director deems necessary to ensure compliance with this article.

L. With the consent of the applicant or permittee, the director may include in an aquifer protection permit for an existing facility the requirement that the applicant or permittee undertake a remedial action, as defined in section 49-281, to prevent, minimize or mitigate damage to the public health or welfare or to the waters of the state resulting from a discharge that occurred before August 13, 1986, if the following conditions are met:

1. The selection of remedial action, including the level and extent of cleanup, was determined according to the criteria in section 49-282.06 and the rules adopted pursuant to that section.

2. The pollutant that was discharged constituted a hazardous substance.

M. With the consent of the applicant or permittee, the director may include in an aquifer protection permit as a condition the mitigation measures authorized under section 49-286 instead of issuing a mitigation order under section 49-286.

N. The director may deny a permit for a facility if the director determines that the applicant is incapable of fully carrying out the terms and conditions of the permit, including any conditions that require monitoring or installing and maintaining discharge control measures. The following apply to an application for a permit or to an issued permit:

1. The director may require the applicant to furnish information, such as past performance, including compliance with or violations of similar laws or rules, and technical and financial competence, relevant to its capability to comply with the permit terms and conditions.

2. For the purposes of evaluating an applicant's financial competence for closure, the director may consider a closure strategy and cost estimate rather than a detailed closure plan.  Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local governmental entity, the cost estimate shall be based on the cost for the applicant or permittee to hire a third party to conduct the closure strategy or plan unless the financial responsibility mechanism provided pursuant to this subsection is a self-assurance or a guarantee and the director determines that the applicant or permittee is technically and financially capable of closing the facility at its own cost and, if necessary, of conducting postclosure monitoring and maintenance. Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local governmental entity, the permittee shall update its cost estimate:

(a) For the duration of the permit on a periodic basis as scheduled in the permit but not more frequently than once every five years.  The cost estimate shall be updated to adjust for inflation or as necessary to reflect increased or decreased costs resulting from changes to the facility or to the facility closure strategy or plan, or to any other relevant conditions related to the facility.

(b) For a significant amendment as defined by rule adopted by the director, if required to address incremental changes in the cost estimate that result from the significant amendment.

3. Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local governmental entity, the applicant or permittee shall demonstrate financial responsibility to cover the estimated costs to close the facility and, if necessary, to conduct postclosure monitoring and maintenance by providing to the director for approval a financial assurance mechanism or combination of mechanisms as prescribed in rules adopted by the director or in 40 Code of Federal Regulations 143 (f)(1) and (10) as of January 1, 2014. An applicant or permittee that demonstrates financial responsibility by means of a self-assurance or guarantee shall aggregate the estimated closure and postclosure costs for all aquifer protection permits in this state for which the applicant, permittee or guarantor has provided a self-assurance or a guarantee in order to determine whether the applicant, permittee or guarantor meets the applicable financial test.

4. The permittee shall maintain its demonstration of financial responsibility prescribed in this subsection for the duration of the individual permit.  Except for a state or federal agency or a county, city, town or other local governmental entity, the permittee shall periodically demonstrate financial responsibility and report to the director that the financial assurance mechanism is being maintained as scheduled in the permit and as prescribed in paragraph 3 of this subsection but not more frequently than once every two years.  The permit's applicable reporting schedule shall be based on the type of financial assurance mechanism that is selected pursuant to this subsection.

5. A demonstration of financial responsibility made for a facility as prescribed by section 49-770 shall suffice, in whole or in part, for any demonstration of financial responsibility prescribed by this section.

6. A demonstration of financial assurance or competence required under this section or section 49-770 for a facility shall not be required before completion of construction but shall be required before the department issues approval to operate.  Financial assurance for a facility is not required pursuant to this section if substantially similar financial assurance for that facility is required and has been provided pursuant to other federal, state or local laws, and evidence of that financial assurance is filed with the director.

7. Financial information required to be supplied under this subsection is confidential.

O. The director shall require an applicant for an individual permit to submit evidence that the discharging facility complies with applicable municipal or county zoning ordinances and regulations.  The director shall not issue the permit unless it appears from the evidence submitted by the applicant that the facility complies with the applicable zoning ordinances and regulations.

P. The director may issue a single area-wide permit applicable to facilities under common ownership and located in a contiguous geographic area in lieu of an individual permit for each facility. In issuing an area-wide permit, the demonstration required under subsection B, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section may be considered collectively for all facilities included in the permit.  The director may evaluate discharge reduction collectively for existing facilities in the pollutant management area by considering any one or all of the factors set forth in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section. The director may consolidate those permit conditions listed in subsection K of this section that have general applicability to the facilities included in the area-wide permit. An area-wide permit shall specify all of the following:

1. A description of the pollutant management area and point or points of compliance.

2. Those facilities that have been evaluated individually for meeting the criteria in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section and that are included in the area-wide permit.

3. For multiple facilities within the pollutant management area that are substantially similar in nature and, considered alone, would have a small discharge impact area compared to other facilities in the area, narrative permit conditions may be used to define the best available demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives consistent with subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section replacing the need for an individual technical review.

4. A compliance schedule for submittal and evaluation of information regarding design and discharge for existing facilities within the pollutant management area that, because of the small size, quantity or quality of discharge, or physical location with regard to the point or points of compliance, the director has determined that review for the purposes of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section shall be conducted in the future.  In determining the requirements and length of a compliance schedule for an area-wide permit, the director shall consider the character and impact of the discharge, the nature of the activities necessary to prepare appropriate technical submittals, the number of persons potentially affected by the discharge, the current state of treatment technology, and the age of the facility.

Q. The director may expedite processing of an aquifer protection permit application by a permit applicant who proposes a new facility to discharge liquids that do not contain any pollutant in a concentration that exceeds a numeric aquifer water quality standard.  The director shall not require the applicant to complete a hydrogeologic study in order to obtain the permit unless the permit applicant is relying on site specific characteristics to meet the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section or unless the study is necessary to demonstrate compliance with narrative aquifer water quality standards.  Applications made pursuant to this subsection shall have precedence and be considered by the department before all other aquifer protection permit applications.

 

#### Section 49-243.01. Presumptive best available demonstrated control technology

A. The director may establish, by rule, presumptive best available demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives, consistent with section 49-243, subsection B, paragraph 1, for a class of facilities, if the director determines that the facilities in that class are substantially similar in nature. Once presumptive controls are established by rule for a particular class of facilities the director shall review those rules every five years and, if appropriate, revise the rules for that class of facilities.

B. An owner or operator of a facility who applies for an individual permit under section 49-243 shall be deemed to have demonstrated that the design meets the requirements of section 49-243, subsection B, paragraph 1, if the application incorporates the presumptive controls for that class of facilities established pursuant to subsection A of this section.

C. A person or group of persons who own or operate facilities that are required to obtain a permit pursuant to this article may petition the director to establish by rule presumptive best available demonstrated control technology, processes, operating methods or other alternatives for that class of facilities. The director may grant the petition if he determines that the following conditions have been met:

1. The petition identifies the class of facilities for which rule adoption is requested.

2. The petition includes a description of the presumptive controls for the requested class of facilities.

3. The petition complies with section 41-1033.

4. The class of facilities described in the petition satisfies subsection A of this section.

D. The owner or operator of a facility with a permit shall not be required to obtain a new or modified permit because of rules adopted or revised pursuant to subsection A of this section. Any complete application that is filed before the effective date of any rules adopted or revised pursuant to this section shall be processed by the department without requiring compliance with the rules adopted or revised pursuant to subsection A of this section.

#### Section 49-244. Point of compliance

The director shall designate a point or points of compliance for each facility receiving a permit under this article.  For the purposes of this chapter, the point of compliance is the point at which compliance must be determined for either the aquifer water quality standards or, if an aquifer water quality standard is exceeded at the time the aquifer protection permit is issued, the requirement that there be no further degradation of the aquifer as provided in section 49-243, subsection B, paragraph 3.  The point of compliance shall be a vertical plane downgradient of the facility that extends through the uppermost aquifers underlying that facility.  For an aquifer that has no existing or reasonably foreseeable drinking water beneficial use, the director may establish monitoring for compliance in another aquifer in lieu of monitoring in the uppermost aquifer.  The point of compliance shall be determined as follows:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this section, for a pollutant that is a hazardous substance the point of compliance is the limit of the pollutant management area. The pollutant management area is the limit projected in the horizontal plane of the area on which pollutants are or will be placed.  The pollutant management area includes horizontal space taken up by any liner, dike or other barrier designed to contain pollutants in the facility.  If the facility contains more than one discharging activity, the pollutant management area is described by an imaginary line circumscribing the several discharging activities.

2. A point of compliance for hazardous substances other than that identified in paragraph 1 of this section may be approved by the director if the facility owner or operator can demonstrate either:

(a) That it is technically impracticable or inappropriate considering the likely fate or transport of a pollutant in an aquifer to monitor at the boundary specified in paragraph 1 of this section.

(b) The alternative point of compliance will allow installation and operation of the monitoring facilities that are substantially less costly. Such a request by a facility owner or operator under this paragraph must be supported by an analysis of the volume and characteristics of the pollutants that may be discharged and the ability of the vadose zone to attenuate the particular pollutants that may be discharged, including such factors as climate, hydrology, geology and soil chemistry. In no event shall an alternative point of compliance be further from the boundary specified in paragraph 1 of this section than is necessary for purposes of this paragraph, subdivisions (a) and (b) of this paragraph, and in no event shall it be so located as to result in an increased threat to an existing or reasonably foreseeable drinking water source.  In addition an alternate compliance point for a hazardous substance pursuant to this subdivision shall never be further downgradient than any of the following:

(i) The property boundary.

(ii) Any point of an existing or reasonably foreseeable future drinking water source.

(iii) Seven hundred fifty feet from the edge of the pollutant management area.

3. For pollutants that are not hazardous substances the director, in identifying a point of compliance, shall take into account the volume and characteristics of the pollutants, the practical difficulties associated with implementation of applicable water pollution control requirements, whether the facility is a new facility or an existing facility, water conservation and augmentation and the site-specific characteristics of the facility, including, but not limited to, climate, hydrology, geology, soil chemistry and pollutant levels in the aquifer.  The point of compliance must be so located as to ensure protection of all current and reasonably foreseeable future uses of the aquifer.

 

#### Section 49-245. Criteria for issuing general permit

A. The director may issue by rule a general permit for a defined class of facilities if all of the following apply:

1. The cost of issuing individual permits cannot be justified by any environmental or public health benefit that may be gained from issuing individual permits.

2. The facilities, activities or practices in the class are substantially similar in nature.

3. The director is satisfied that appropriate conditions under a general permit for operating the facilities or conducting the activity will meet the applicable requirements in section 49-243 or, as to facilities for which the director has established best management practices, section 49-246.

B. In addition to other applicable enforcement actions, if a person violates the conditions of a general permit, the director may revoke the general permit for that person and require that the person obtain an individual permit. A general permit may be revoked, modified or suspended at any time by the director if necessary to comply with this chapter.

C. Rules establishing a general permit shall include terms and conditions to ensure that all discharges and facilities will meet the requirements of this chapter and shall provide for the collective or individual revocation of the general permit if necessary to ensure compliance with this chapter.

D. Rules adopted pursuant to subsection A of this section may require a person who owns or operates a facility seeking coverage under a general permit to notify the director of the person's intent to operate the facility pursuant to the general permit and pay the applicable fee required pursuant to section 49-203.

#### Section 49-245.01. Storm water general permit

A. A general permit is issued for facilities used solely for the management of storm water and that are regulated by the clean water act or article 3.1 of this chapter, including catchments, impoundments and sumps, provided the following conditions are met:

1. The owner or operator of the facility has obtained a national pollutant discharge elimination system permit issued pursuant to the clean water act or an Arizona pollutant discharge elimination system permit under article 3.1 of this chapter for any storm water discharges at the facility, or that the facility has applied, and not been denied coverage, for these types of permits for any storm water discharges at the facility.

2. The owner or operator notifies the director that the facility has met the requirements of paragraph 1 of this subsection.

3. The owner or operator of the facility has in place any required storm water pollution prevention plan.

B. If the director determines that discharges of storm water from a facility or facilities covered by this general permit are causing a violation of aquifer water quality standards at the applicable point of compliance, the director may revoke the general permit of the facility or facilities or may require that an individual permit be obtained pursuant to section 49-243. If the director determines that discharges of storm water from a facility or facilities covered by this general permit, with reasonable probability, may cause a violation of aquifer water quality standards at the applicable point of compliance, the director may require a facility or facilities covered by the general permit to obtain an individual permit pursuant to section 49-243.

#### Section 49-245.02. General permit for certain discharges associated with man-made bodies of water

A. A general permit is issued for the following discharges:

1. Disposal in vadose zone injection wells of storm water mixed with reclaimed wastewater or groundwater, or both, from man-made bodies of water associated with golf courses, parks and residential common areas, provided that:

(ii) Federal regulations adopted by the United States environmental protection agency pursuant to 42 United States Code section 300h.

(b) The discharge occurs only in response to storm events.

(c) With the exception of the aquifer water quality standard for microbiological contaminants, the reclaimed wastewater meets aquifer water quality standards before being placed into the body of water, as documented by a water quality analysis submitted with the vadose zone injection well registration. The owner or operator of the vadose zone injection wells shall demonstrate continued compliance with this subdivision by submitting to the department the results of any monitoring required as part of an aquifer protection permit or wastewater reuse permit for any facility providing reclaimed wastewater to the man-made body of water. For purposes of this general permit, monitoring shall be conducted at least semiannually. The monitoring results shall be submitted to the department semiannually beginning six months after the inventory made pursuant to subdivision (a) of this paragraph.

(d) The vadose zone injection wells shall be located at least one hundred feet from any water supply well.

(e) A vertical separation of forty feet shall be provided between the bottom of the vadose zone injection wells and the water table to allow the aquifer water quality standard for microbiological contaminants to be met in the uppermost aquifer.

(f) The vadose zone injection wells are not used for any other purpose.

2. Subsurface discharges from man-made bodies of water associated with golf courses, parks and residential common areas, provided that:

(a) The body of water contains only groundwater, storm water or reclaimed wastewater, or a combination thereof.

(b) The reclaimed wastewater complies with the terms of a wastewater reuse permit before being placed into the body of water.

(c) The body of water is lined and maintained to achieve a hydraulic conductivity of 10-7 cm/sec or less.

3. Point source discharges to protected surface waters from man-made bodies of water associated with golf courses, parks and residential common areas that contain only groundwater, storm water or reclaimed wastewater, or a combination thereof, provided that:

(a) The discharges are subject to a valid national pollutant discharge elimination system permit or an Arizona pollutant discharge elimination system permit under article 3.1 of this chapter.

(b) The discharges occur only in response to storm events.

(c) With the exception of the aquifer water quality standard for microbiological contaminants, the reclaimed wastewater meets aquifer water quality standards before being placed into the body of water.

B. If the director determines that discharges from a facility covered by this general permit are causing a violation of aquifer water quality standards, the director may revoke the general permit of the facility or may require that an individual permit be obtained pursuant to section 49-243. If the director determines that discharges from a facility covered by this general permit may cause, with reasonable probability, a violation of aquifer water quality standards, the director may require the facility to obtain an individual permit pursuant to section 49-243.

#### Section 49-246. Criteria for developing best management practices

A. Pursuant to section 49-245, the director may issue a general permit for facilities requiring implementation of best management practices appropriate to the class of discharges to be regulated. The director shall:

1. Identify the aquifer water quality problem which must be addressed and determine that protection of aquifer water quality standards can be accomplished through development and implementation of a best management practice for the class of discharge.

2. Assign a specific advisory committee to create the specific class best management practice to regulate the problem and report its recommendations to the director on a specified schedule.

3. On issuing a general permit containing best management practices, make a reasonable effort to notify persons conducting or managing the activity subject to the best management practices of the requirements of the best management practices contained in the general permit.

B. The director may establish best management practices for the following facilities or activities:

1. On-site facilities for urban runoff.

2. Storm sewers.

3. Urban runoff.

4. Silvicultural activities.

5. Septic tank systems.

C. The director may by rule establish best management practices for additional facilities or activities pursuant to this section, if all of the following apply:

1. The facilities or activities meet the criteria in section 49-245, subsection A, paragraphs 1 and 2.

2. The individual facilities or activities within the class are conducted over a large geographic area.

#### Section 49-247. Agricultural general permits; best management practices for regulated agricultural activities

A. The director shall adopt by rule, pursuant to the requirements of this section, agricultural general permits consisting of best management practices for regulated agricultural activities. Agricultural general permits are not subject to section 49-245 or 49-246. Except as provided in subsection G of this section, a person is not required to obtain an individual permit for a regulated agricultural activity.

B. The terms and conditions of agricultural general permits adopted pursuant to this section shall be agricultural best management practices which have been determined by the director to be the most practical and effective means of reducing or preventing the discharge of pollutants by regulated agricultural activities. Agricultural best management practices may vary within the state, according to regional and hydrogeologic conditions.  The director may waive the use of best management practices in a designated region if the director determines that existing regulated agricultural activities will not cause or contribute to a violation of the adopted water quality standards.

C. The director shall adopt, by rule, agricultural best management practices.

D. In adopting agricultural best management practices, the director shall consider:

1. The availability, the effectiveness and the economic and institutional considerations of alternative technologies.

2. The potential nature and severity of discharges from regulated agricultural activities and their effect on public health and the environment.

E. In adopting best management practices for regulated agricultural activities, the director shall require the application of all economically feasible best management practices which have been determined by the director to be the most practical and effective means of reducing or preventing the discharge of pollutants by regulated agricultural activities but shall not require application of more stringent practices if such a requirement would result in cessation of the regulated activity.

F. Compliance with best management practices adopted pursuant to this section constitutes compliance with this article.

G. If the director, after providing a person with notice and an opportunity for a hearing, determines that the person has violated the applicable best management practices, the director may revoke the agricultural general permit for that person and require that the person obtain a permit pursuant to section 49-241.

H. The director may periodically reexamine, evaluate and propose any modification to or waiver of agricultural best management practices necessary to meet the requirements of this article.

 

#### Section 49-249. Aquifer pollution information

The director shall make available to the public upon request and on the agency's web site every five years the levels of pollutants in aquifers in this state and the effects of regulation under this chapter in general and best management practices in particular on controlling or reducing pollution in aquifers.

 

#### Section 49-250. Exemptions

A. The director, by rule, may exempt specifically described classes or categories of facilities from the aquifer protection permit requirements of this article on a finding either that there is no reasonable probability of degradation of the aquifer or that aquifer water quality will be maintained and protected because the discharges from the facilities are regulated under other federal or state programs that provide the same or greater aquifer water quality protection as provided by this article.

B. The following are exempt from the aquifer protection permit requirement of this article:

1. Household and domestic activities.

2. Household gardening, lawn watering, lawn care, landscape maintenance and related activities.

3. The noncommercial use of consumer products generally available to and used by the public.

#### Section 49-251. Temporary emergency waiver

A. A facility owner or operator may apply for, and the director may issue, a temporary emergency waiver of compliance with the requirement to obtain a permit or with any applicable permit requirement, surface or aquifer water quality standard or discharge limitation if the waiver will not endanger human health or welfare, and if the director finds any of the following:

1. That an emergency of such severity exists that water supplies for domestic uses will be inadequate to meet demand unless the facility is able to temporarily exceed one or more water quality standards or discharge limitations by its discharge into waters of the state.

2. That there has been a breakdown of equipment or upset of operations resulting in a discharge to waters of the state in excess of one or more water quality standards or discharge limitations, and both of the following apply:

(a) The breakdown or upset was beyond the control of the facility owner or operator and the facility was being operated in compliance with this chapter before the discharge.

(b) The breakdown or upset will be corrected in a reasonable period of time.

3. That the activity that is the subject of the waiver is necessary to protect human health or welfare or minimize potential adverse impacts to the environment.

B. A temporary emergency waiver of compliance issued by the director may be subject to such reasonable terms and conditions as the director deems necessary. The director may grant a waiver after the occurrence of the activity that is subject to the waiver if the applicant demonstrates that exigent circumstances made it impractical to secure the waiver in advance.

C. As a condition to the issuance of a temporary emergency waiver of compliance, the director may require the facility owner or operator to provide notice of the waiver to all downstream or downgradient users directly affected by both:

1. Publication on not less than three consecutive days, or on three consecutive weeks in the case of weekly publications, in a newspaper or newspapers of general circulation in the area in which the emergency or breakdown has occurred or is occurring.

2. Furnishing a copy of the publication to the radio and television stations serving the area in which the emergency or breakdown has occurred or is occurring.

D. The facility owner or operator shall furnish a copy of the publication to the director.

E. A temporary emergency waiver of compliance issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect as long as necessary to accommodate the emergency but in no event longer than ninety days.

F. A person operating under a temporary emergency waiver is not subject to section 49-262 or 49-263 for discharges allowed under the temporary emergency waiver but is subject to article 5 of this chapter.

#### Section 49-252. Closure notification and approval

A. A person who owns or operates a dry well subject to this article or a groundwater protection permit facility as defined in section 49-241.01, subsection C or a person who has been issued a permit pursuant to this article shall notify the director of the intent to permanently cease an activity for which the facility or a portion of the facility was designed or operated.

B. Within ninety days of the notification in subsection A of this section, the owner or operator shall submit a closure plan to the director.

C. Within sixty days of submittal of a complete closure plan, the director shall determine whether or not the closure plan is for a clean closure.

D. If the director determines that the closure plan is for a clean closure, the director shall send a letter of approval to the owner or operator and no aquifer protection permit shall be required.

E. If the director determines that the proposed closure plan achieves a closure condition other than clean closure, the owner or operator shall submit either an application for an aquifer protection permit or a request to modify a current aquifer protection permit in order to address closure activities and postclosure monitoring and maintenance at the facility. The director shall require submittal of a permit application or a request to modify a permit within ninety days or a reasonable time not to exceed one year, if the applicant can supply a scope of work justifying a schedule for collecting the technical information necessary to apply.

The director shall issue general permits or authorize coverage under existing general permits, subject to the limitations prescribed in subsection B of this section and section 49-221, subsection A, paragraph 1 for point source discharges of storm water from industrial or construction activity to non-WOTUS protected surface waters.  The director shall use a best management practices approach when issuing and implementing general permits for storm water discharges from industrial or construction activity to non-WOTUS protected surface waters and may include analytical monitoring and discharge limits if best management practices cannot achieve applicable surface water quality standards.  The director may issue an individual permit for those discharges only if the director determines, using reasonably current credible and scientifically defensible data, that a particular discharge is a significant contributor of pollutants to a non-WOTUS protected surface water that causes the water to exceed one or more applicable water quality standards.  When making this determination, the director shall consider the location of the discharge with respect to the non-WOTUS protected surface water, the size of the discharge and the quantity and nature of the pollutants discharged. If the director determines that an individual permit is required for a discharge of storm water from industrial or construction activity to a non-WOTUS protected surface water, the discharger must be notified in writing and informed of the reasons for the determination and the right to appeal the individual permit determination.

D. The director shall issue general permits or authorize coverage under existing general permits, subject to the limitations in subsection B of this section and section 49-221, subsection A, paragraph 1 for other categories of potential point source discharges, including de minimis discharges, to non-WOTUS protected surface waters that involve the same or substantially similar types of operations, contain the same or substantially similar types of pollutants and are more appropriately controlled under a general permit than under an individual permit.

E. The director may adopt rules for point source discharges to non-WOTUS protected surface waters. The rules adopted by the director under this subsection shall not include any requirement that is more stringent than requirements of the clean water act, shall provide for issuing, authorizing, denying, modifying, suspending or revoking individual or general permits and shall establish permit conditions to carry out the permit program established by this section.

F. The director shall not construe any rule to require oversight by the United States environmental protection agency of permits or portions of permits for discharges to non-WOTUS protected surface waters, and a rule shall not apply if it would require review, approval or enforcement by the United States environmental protection agency of discharges to non-WOTUS protected surface waters.

G. In permits for discharges to WOTUS and non-WOTUS protected surface waters, the director shall not impose duplicative permit requirements.

H. The director shall not delegate to any city, town or county the authority to require permits for point source discharges from construction activity to non-WOTUS protected surface waters.

#### Section 49-255.05. Best management practices for activities within non-WOTUS

A. The director shall adopt by rule best management practices and notification requirements to ensure that the activities prescribed in this section do not violate applicable surface water quality standards.  The director may include only those best management practices that extend to:

1. Activities conducted within the ordinary high watermark of perennial or intermittent non-WOTUS protected surface waters.

2. Activities conducted within the bed and banks of waters that materially impact downstream non-WOTUS protected surface waters. The director shall determine through rulemaking what constitutes a material impact and that rulemaking shall be based on factors that include distance and topography.

3. Activities that are not already regulated under this title.

B. The director may not adopt best management practices and notification requirements for the following:

1. Discharges to a non-WOTUS protected surface water incidental to a recharge project.

3. Maintenance but not construction of drainage ditches.

4. Construction and maintenance of irrigation ditches.

5. Maintenance of structures such as dams, dikes and levees.

### Article 3.2 - Dredge and Fill Permit Program

#### Section 49-256. Adoption and enactment of federal definitions

For the purposes of this article and for establishing primacy for this state's dredge and fill permit program under 33 United States Code section 1344, the following definitions are adopted and enacted as follows:

1. "Compensatory mitigation" means the restoration (re-establishment or rehabilitation), establishment (creation), enhancement, and/or in certain circumstances preservation of aquatic resources for the purposes of offsetting unavoidable adverse impacts that remain after all appropriate and practicable avoidance and minimization has been achieved.

2. "Dredged material" means material that is excavated or dredged from WOTUS.

3. "Fill material" means:

(a) Except as specified in subdivision (c) of this definition, the term fill material means material placed in WOTUS where the material has the effect of either:

(i) Replacing any portion of a WOTUS with dry land.

(ii) Changing the bottom elevation of any portion of a WOTUS.

(b) Examples of such fill material include, but are not limited to: rock, sand, soil, clay, plastics, construction debris, wood chips, overburden from mining or other excavation activities, and materials used to create any structure or infrastructure in the WOTUS.

(c) The term fill material does not include trash or garbage.

4. "General permit" means a permit authorizing a category of discharges of dredged or fill material under this article. General permits are permits for categories of discharge which are similar in nature, will cause only minimal adverse environmental effects when performed separately, and will have only minimal cumulative adverse effect on the environment.

5. "In-lieu fee program" means a program involving the restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation of aquatic resources through funds paid to a governmental or non-profit natural resources management entity to satisfy compensatory mitigation requirements for dredge and fill permits issued pursuant to this article. Similar to but distinct from a mitigation bank, an in-lieu fee program sells compensatory mitigation credits to permittees whose obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is then transferred to the in-lieu program sponsor. The operation and use of an in-lieu fee program are governed by an in-lieu fee program instrument.

6. "Mitigation bank" means a site, or suite of sites, where resources (e.g., wetlands, streams, riparian areas) are restored, established, enhanced, and/or preserved for the purpose of providing compensatory mitigation for impacts authorized by dredge and fill permits issued pursuant to this article. In general, a mitigation bank sells compensatory mitigation credits to permittees whose obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is then transferred to the mitigation bank sponsor. The operation and use of a mitigation bank are governed by a mitigation banking instrument.

7. "Party affected by a jurisdictional determination" means a permit applicant, landowner, a lease, easement or option holder, or other individual who has an identifiable and substantial legal interest in the property (or a person acting with the approval of any of the foregoing) who has received an approved jurisdictional determination.

8. "Permittee-responsible mitigation" means an aquatic resource restoration, establishment, enhancement, and/or preservation activity undertaken by the permittee (or an authorized agent or contractor) to provide compensatory mitigation for which the permittee retains full responsibility.

9. "Practicable" means available and capable of being done after taking into consideration cost, existing technology, and logistics in light of overall project purposes.

10. "Wetlands" means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs, and similar areas.

#### Section 49-256.01. Dredge and fill permit program; permits; rules; prohibitions; exemptions; exceptions; notice

 

(Conditionally Rpld.)

 

A. To implement the permit program established by 33 United States Code section 1344, the director may establish by rule a dredge and fill permit program that is consistent with and not more stringent than the clean water act dredge and fill program, including a permitting process.

B. During any period in which the state has been granted authority to administer the permit program established by 33 United States Code section 1344, a person may not discharge dredged or fill material unless the discharge is exempt under 33 United States Code section 1344(f) or rules adopted pursuant to this article, except under either of the following conditions:

1. In conformance with a permit that is issued or authorized under this article.

2. Pursuant to a permit that is issued or authorized by the United States army corps of engineers until a permit that is issued or authorized under this article takes effect.

C. Rules adopted by the director for the purposes of a permit program for dredge and fill shall:

1. Provide for issuing, authorizing, denying, modifying, suspending or revoking individual permits, general permits and emergency permits for the discharge of dredged or fill material into WOTUS regulated by this state under the clean water act for purposes of implementing the permit program established by 33 United States Code

2. Establish permit conditions that ensure compliance with the applicable requirements of section 404 of the clean water act, including the guidelines issued under 33 United States Code section 1344(b)(1).

3. Establish maintenance, monitoring, sampling, reporting, recordkeeping and any other permitting requirements as necessary to maintain primary enforcement responsibility or to determine compliance with this article.

4. Establish the following in accordance with 33 United States Code section 1344:

(a) Circumstances and activities that do not require a dredge or fill permit.

(b) Activities that are exempt from the requirements of this article for any discharge or fill material that may result from those activities, and the conditions under which those activities are exempt.

(c) Circumstances under which a discharge of dredged or fill material shall not be permitted.

5. Establish procedures for the director to make jurisdictional determinations that determine whether a wetland or waterbody is a  WOTUS subject to regulatory jurisdiction under this article. Jurisdictional determinations:

(a) Shall be in writing and be identified as either preliminary or approved.

(b) Do not include determinations that a particular activity requires a permit under this article.

6. Establish public notice and comment procedures as necessary to maintain primacy for the dredge and fill permit program and as the director deems appropriate to inform the public.

7. Provide for any other provisions necessary to maintain state primary enforcement responsibility under 33 United States Code section 1344 and to implement the provisions of this article.

D. Approved jurisdictional determinations are appealable agency actions as defined by section 41-1092 and may be appealed by a party affected by a jurisdictional determination. Preliminary jurisdictional determinations are not appealable agency actions and notwithstanding section 41-1092.03, the right to appeal an approved jurisdictional determination does not extend to adjacent landowners or to third parties that are not parties affected by a jurisdictional determination.

E. On assuming authority to administer the permit program established by 33 United States Code section 1344, the department shall:

1. On request by a party affected by a jurisdictional determination, recognize and adopt any existing approved jurisdictional determinations that were originally issued by the United States army corps of engineers if the federal definition of  WOTUS that is applicable in this state has not changed since the issuance of the approved jurisdictional determinations.

2. On request by a party affected by a jurisdictional determination, renew approved jurisdictional determinations that were originally issued by the United States army corps of engineers on the same terms as the original unless:

(a) Physical changes have occurred affecting the determination that are likely to alter the jurisdictional status.

(b) The federal definition of WOTUS that is applicable in this state has changed since the issuance of the approved jurisdictional determinations.

(c) Additional field data show that the original determination was based on inaccurate data and the new data warrant a revision to the original determination.

 

 

#### Section 49-256.02. Compensatory mitigation

 

(Conditionally Rpld.)

 

A. As a part of the program established pursuant to section 49-256.01, and consistent with the guidelines established pursuant to 33 United States Code section 1344(b)(1), the director shall establish by rule standards and criteria for the use of all types of compensatory mitigation, including on-site and off-site permittee-responsible mitigation, mitigation banks and in-lieu fee mitigation to offset unavoidable impacts to WOTUS authorized by permits issued under this article.

B. Mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs may be used to compensate for unavoidable impacts to WOTUS that are authorized by general permits and individual permits, including after-the-fact permits, in accordance with rules established pursuant to this section.  In addition to other potential injunctive relief or other relief requested under section 49-262, mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs may be used to satisfy requirements arising from an enforcement action under this article.

C. Rules established by the director pursuant to this section shall identify alternative compensatory mitigation options for a permit applicant if an approved mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program that is located in the same watershed as the permit applicant's proposed discharge rejects that permit applicant's participation in that mitigation bank or in-lieu fee program.

### Article 3.3 - Underground Injection Control Permit Program

#### Section 49-257. Applicability of federal definitions

A copy of the results of any analysis made of these samples shall be furnished promptly to the well owner.

2. To conduct appropriate remedial actions regarding vertical cross-contamination or to investigate liability regarding contamination of groundwater caused by vertical cross-contamination.

B. The director of environmental quality shall notify the director of water resources of the results of the inspection and shall provide copies of its records and documents and the analysis of any samples taken. If it is determined that a well results in vertical cross-contamination, the director of environmental quality, upon receiving permission from the well owner or operator, may take appropriate remedial action, including well modification, abandonment or replacement, or provision of a replacement water supply.

C. A well owner who is not a responsible party pursuant to this article and who cooperates with the investigation and remedial activities of the director and the department of water resources to the extent possible consistent with its water delivery responsibilities and system operational requirements shall receive a covenant not to sue for secondary contamination resulting from the well unless the well owner had actual knowledge of groundwater contamination and constructed a well in violation of well construction requirements administered by the director of water resources, resulting in vertical cross-contamination of an aquifer.

D. Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, if the director takes remedial action pursuant to subsection A of this section and the well owner or operator is later determined to be responsible under this article for a release of hazardous substances which contaminated the well, the well owner or operator responsible for the release shall reimburse the fund for the owner or operator's proportionate share of the costs incurred in taking the action.

E. This section shall not be construed to limit the director's authority to take actions as authorized by other provisions in this article or any other law.

#### Section 49-282.05. Agreements for work; suspension of remedial action

A. The department may enter into an agreement with any person to perform work at a site on the site registry if the work will be conducted in accordance with the rules adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06. The terms and conditions of the agreement may include a suspension of any remedial action by the director at the site to the extent determined by the director to be appropriate.  The suspension shall be specifically stated in the agreement or the approval of work under the agreement and shall continue as long as the person is in compliance with the agreement.

B. As a condition of an agreement under this section, the department may require the person conducting the work to reimburse the director for the reasonable and necessary costs incurred in reviewing and overseeing the work, including costs consisting of salaries and benefits paid to state employees and other direct and indirect costs. A person who reimburses the department for costs pursuant to this subsection may recover those costs in any action brought pursuant to section 49-285, subsection H.

#### Section 49-282.06. Remedial action criteria; rules

A. Remedial actions shall:

1. Assure the protection of public health and welfare and the environment.

2. To the extent practicable, provide for the control, management or cleanup of the hazardous substances in order to allow the maximum beneficial use of the waters of the state.

3. Be reasonable, necessary, cost-effective and technically feasible.

B. The director shall adopt rules necessary to implement this article. The director may adopt CERCLA rules, guidelines or procedures by reference to the extent consistent with this article. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection shall include rules for:

1. The use of monies from the fund, including establishing priorities for the use of the monies from the fund.

2. The scoring and rescoring of sites or portions of sites.

3. The criteria for a finding of no further action for sites pursuant to section 49-287.01.

4. The selection of remedial actions including the establishment of the level and extent of cleanup at a site or a portion of a site. The rules shall provide for the selection of a remedial action by comparison of alternative remedial actions, which may include no action, monitoring, source control, controlled migration, physical containment, plume remediation and the consideration of the criteria in subsection C of this section. The rules also shall provide that the selected remedial action meet the requirements of subsection A of this section and the following:

(a) For remediation of soil, the selected remedial action shall be consistent with the soil remediation standards adopted pursuant to section 49-152.

(b) For remediation of waters of the state, the selected remedial action shall address, at a minimum, any well that at the time of selection of the remedial action either supplies water for municipal, domestic, industrial, irrigation or agricultural uses or is part of a public water system if the well would now or in the reasonably foreseeable future produce water that would not be fit for its current or reasonably foreseeable end uses without treatment due to the release of hazardous substances. The specific measures to address any such well shall not reduce the supply of water available to the owner of the well.

5. Incentives for initiating early remedial actions and implementing innovative remedial technologies.

C. In adopting the rules required by this section and in selecting remedial actions, the director shall consider the following factors:

1. Population, environmental and welfare concerns at risk.

2. Routes of exposure.

3. Amount, concentration, hazardous properties, environmental fate, such as the ability to bioaccumulate, persistence and probability of reaching the waters of the state, and the form of the substance present.

4. Physical factors affecting human and environmental exposure such as hydrogeology, climate and the extent of previous and expected migration.

5. The extent to which the amount of water available for beneficial use will be preserved by a particular type of remedial action.

6. The technical practicality and cost-effectiveness of alternative remedial actions applicable to a site.

7. The availability of other appropriate federal or state remedial action and enforcement mechanisms, including, to the extent consistent with this article, funding sources established under CERCLA, to respond to the release.

D. Notwithstanding this article, the director may approve a remedial action that may result in water quality exceeding water quality standards after the completion of the remedy if the director finds that the remedial action meets the requirements of this section.

E. The director's approval pursuant to this section does not affect the classification of an aquifer pursuant to section 49-224.

F. Remedial actions required by this article shall be consistent with the requirements of title 45, chapter 2, except as provided in section 49-290.01.

#### Section 49-283. Responsible party liability exemptions; definitions

A. For purposes of imposing liability under this article, and except as provided in this section, a person is deemed the party responsible for the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance if the person:

1. Owned or operated the facility:

(a) When the hazardous substance was placed or came to be located in or on the facility.

(b) When the hazardous substance was located in or on the facility but before the release.

(c) During the time of the release or threatened release.

2. Owned or possessed the hazardous substance and arranged, by contract, agreement or otherwise, for the disposal, treatment or transport for disposal or treatment of the hazardous substance.

3. Accepted for transport to a disposal or treatment facility waste that contained a hazardous substance and either selected the facility to which it was transported or disposed of it in a manner contrary to law.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, a person that owns real property is not a responsible party if there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance from a facility in or on the property unless one or more of the following applies to that person:

1. Was engaged in the business of generating, transporting, storing, treating or disposing of a hazardous substance at the facility or disposing of waste at the facility, or knowingly permitted others to engage in such a business at the facility.

2. Permitted any person to use the facility for disposal of a hazardous substance.

3. Knew or reasonably should have known that a hazardous substance was located in or on the facility at the time right, title or interest in the property was first acquired by the person and engaged in conduct by which he associated himself with the release. For the purpose of this paragraph, a written warranty, representation or undertaking, which is set forth in an instrument conveying any right, title or interest in the real property and which is executed by the person conveying the right, title or interest, or which is set forth in any memorandum of any such instrument executed for the purpose of recording, is admissible as evidence of whether the person acquiring any right, title or interest in the real property knew or reasonably should have known that a hazardous substance was located in or on the facility. For purposes of this paragraph, "associated himself with the release" means having actual knowledge of the release and taking action or failing to take action that the person is authorized to take and that increases the volume or toxicity of the hazardous substance that has been released.

4. Took action which significantly contributed to the release after he knew or reasonably should have known that a hazardous substance was located in or on the facility.

C. Any liability which accrues to an owner of real property under this section does not accrue to any other person who is not an owner of the real property merely because the other person holds some right, title or interest in the real property. An owner of real property on which a public utility easement is located is not a responsible party with respect to any release caused by any act or omission of the public utility which holds the easement in carrying out the specific use for which the easement was granted.

D. A person otherwise deemed a responsible party is not liable under this article if he can establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance and the resulting damages were caused solely by:

1. An act of God.

2. An act of war.

3. An act or omission of a third party, whether lawful or unlawful including acts of vandalism or unlawful disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances, other than an employee or agent of that person or other than one whose act or omission occurs in connection with a contractual relationship, existing directly or indirectly, with that person, unless the sole contractual arrangement arises from a published tariff and acceptance for carriage by a common carrier by rail, if that person establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that:

(a) He exercised due care with respect to the hazardous substance concerned, taking into consideration the characteristics of the hazardous substance in light of all relevant facts and circumstances.

(b) He took precautions against foreseeable acts or omissions of any such third party and the consequences that could foreseeably result from such acts or omissions.

4. A release or threatened release which was subject to limits or conditions in a federal permit or a state permit relating to the protection of public health or the environment and the operation of the releasing facility has been and is in compliance with applicable limits or conditions.

5. The application of a pesticide product registered under the federal insecticide, fungicide, and rodenticide act (61 Stat. 163) and applied according to label requirements.

6. Liability has been assumed by the federal postclosure liability fund established under 42 United States Code section 9607(k).

7. Any combination of paragraphs 1 through 6 of this subsection.

E. A person is not a responsible party with respect to a hazardous substance that is located on or beneath property that is owned or occupied by that person if the hazardous substance is present solely because it migrated from property that is not owned or occupied by that person and that person is not otherwise a responsible party as prescribed by subsection A, paragraph 2 or 3.

F. A person is not liable for costs or damages incurred solely as a result of an action taken or omitted while rendering care, assistance or advice that is consistent with rules adopted by the director, is consistent with the national contingency plan or is under the direction of an on-scene coordinator appointed pursuant to the national contingency plan and that is rendered with respect to a release or a threat of a release of a hazardous substance that creates a danger to public health or the environment. This subsection does not preclude liability for costs or damages that result from that person's negligence.

G. A state or local government and its employees or authorized representatives are not liable for costs or damages incurred as a result of an action taken in response to an emergency created by the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance that is generated by or from a facility owned by another person. This subsection does not preclude liability for costs or damages that result from gross negligence or intentional misconduct by this state or local government. For purposes of this subsection, reckless, willful or wanton misconduct constitutes gross negligence.

H. A person who maintains indicia of ownership in a property primarily to protect a security interest in a facility and who does not participate in the management of the facility is not liable as an owner or operator of that facility pursuant to this section. This subsection does not apply to a person who does any of the following:

1. Through intentional misconduct or gross negligence causes, contributes to or aggravates the release of a hazardous substance.

2. Fails to disclose to the facility's purchaser the known presence of a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance at the time of sale or divestiture of the facility or the security interest in the facility.

3. Fails to obtain a phase I environmental assessment of the facility that complies with standards adopted by rule pursuant to subsection K of this section at the time of or at a reasonable time before foreclosure. This paragraph does not apply to residential properties with fewer than five residential units.

4. Fails to do any of the following after acquiring ownership of the facility:

(a) Provide the department reasonable access so that the necessary remedial actions may be conducted.

(b) Undertake reasonable steps to control access to the area of known presence of a release of a hazardous substance to protect the public health and welfare and the environment.

(c) Act diligently to sell or otherwise divest the property within two years of the lender's possession or ownership, whichever is earlier.

I. A fiduciary is not personally liable as an owner or operator pursuant to this section. This section does not preclude claims against assets held in an estate, a trust or other fiduciary capacity for the release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance from one of the assets. This section does not apply if either of the following apply:

1. A fiduciary through intentional misconduct or gross negligence causes, aggravates or contributes to the release or threatened release of hazardous substances or permits others to do so, except that a fiduciary shall not be liable for the intentional misconduct or gross negligence of any nonemployee agent or independent contractor if the fiduciary has not specifically directed the nonemployee agent or independent contractor to perform the grossly negligent act or engage in the intentional misconduct.

2. The appointment of the fiduciary is for the purpose of avoiding liability under this article. It is prima facie evidence that the fiduciary was appointed to avoid liability under this article if the facility is the only substantial asset in the fiduciary estate.

J. Subsections F, G, H and I shall not be construed to affect the liability of any person who is otherwise liable with respect to the release or threat of release pursuant to this section.

K. The director may adopt rules to implement subsections H and I.

L. A fiduciary may not be a fiduciary and grantor of the same fiduciary estate.

M. A unit of state or local government is not liable for purposes of this section if that unit is not liable under section 101(35)(A)(ii) or section 101(20)(D) of CERCLA.

N. Nonmanagerial employees acting within the course and scope of their employment are not liable under this article.

O. For purposes of this section:

1. "Fiduciary" means:

(a) A trust company or bank certified or authorized to engage in the trust business pursuant to title 6, chapter 8, article 1.

(b) Any person appointed by a court or testamentary act to act as personal representative, executor, trustee, administrator, guardian, conservator, receiver or trustee in bankruptcy.

(c) Any person acting as a trustee of a deed of trust pursuant to section 33-803.

(d) Any person acting as a trustee pursuant to title 14, chapter 7.

(e) Any person acting pursuant to and subject to fiduciary obligations under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (29 United States Code sections 1101 through 1114).

2. "Indicia of ownership" means legal or equitable title that has been acquired through or is incident to the default of a borrower.

#### Section 49-283.01. Remediated water; liability; definitions

A. A provider or user of remediated water is not liable for damages caused or contributed to by the use or distribution of the remediated water except on a showing of wilful, malicious or grossly negligent conduct that was the direct cause of the damages.

B. For purposes of this section:

1. "Damages" means compensation for death or injury to a person or claims for medical monitoring or injury that a person may suffer or property damage.

2. "Provider" means an owner or operator of a constructed water conveyance system for industrial, municipal or irrigation purposes.

3. "Remediated water" means water that is distributed, transported or used in connection with a CERCLA remediation or a remediation performed pursuant to this title including water that meets applicable state or federal standards.

4. "User" means an entity that accepts remediated water and uses that water for industrial, municipal, irrigation or agricultural purposes.

 

#### Section 49-283.02. Petroleum liability

A release of petroleum or a constituent of petroleum, as defined in section 49-1001, that is a hazardous substance, as defined in section 49-201, shall be subject to the remedial and liability provisions of this article if the release is not otherwise subject to the corrective or remedial action provisions of section 49-1005, chapter 5 of this title or subchapter III of the federal act defined in section 49-921 (42 United States Code sections 6921 through 6939e), and the release has migrated in groundwater beyond the boundary of the property on which the release occurred.

#### Section 49-284. Notice; reportable quantities; penalties

A. Notwithstanding any other requirement of state or federal law, any person who is the owner or operator of a facility shall, as soon as the person has knowledge of any release, other than a release in compliance with the limits or conditions in a federal or state permit, of a hazardous substance from such facility, immediately notify the director of the release if either:

1. The release is in a quantity equal to or greater than that which is required to be reported to the national response center under section 103 of CERCLA (42 United States Code section 9603).

2. The release is in a quantity equal to or greater than that determined pursuant to subsection B of this section and the release was not reported to the national response center before August 13, 1986.

B. The director shall, by rule, establish reportable quantities for those hazardous substances for which such quantities have not been established under section 102 of CERCLA (42 United States Code section 9602). The director may determine that one single quantity shall be the reportable quantity for that hazardous substance, regardless of the medium into which the hazardous substance is released.

C. Any person who fails to immediately notify the director as provided in subsection A of this section is subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed ten thousand dollars. The attorney general may, and at the request of the director shall, commence an action in superior court to recover civil penalties provided by this subsection. All civil penalties assessed pursuant to this section shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund.

D. Notification received pursuant to this section or information obtained by the exploitation of such notification shall not be used against any reporting person in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury or for giving a false statement.

#### Section 49-285. Liability for remedial actions costs; limitation of actions

A. Except as otherwise provided in section 49-283, a person who is a responsible party shall be strictly and severally liable for such reasonable, necessary and cost-effective expenditures for remedial actions as are incurred by this state, a political subdivision of this state or any other person in a manner consistent with the rules and procedures adopted under section 49-282.06, but not including nonrecoverable costs. A responsible party may be held liable for remedial action costs for a release of a hazardous substance even though the conduct that resulted in the release or the release itself occurred before August 13, 1986.

B. In order to preserve any right to recover remedial action costs from responsible parties, remedial actions conducted by this state, a political subdivision of this state or any other person shall when evaluated as a whole be in substantial compliance with the rules and procedures adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06. The director's approval of a remedial action that is conducted by a person other than the state is not required to preserve any right to recover remedial action costs from potentially responsible parties. Any person other than the state who undertakes a remedial action may request that the director approve the remedial action as prescribed by rules adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06 at any time before, during or after the remedial action. The director's decision shall be in writing and shall specify the basis of the decision. Any remedial action so approved by the director shall be deemed to be in substantial compliance with the rules and procedures adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06. Any person who requests the director's approval of a remedial action shall reimburse the department for the total reasonable cost to the department for the review of the remedial action unless the director waives all or a part of the reimbursement. These monies shall be deposited in the water quality assurance revolving fund established by section 49-282. Costs that are reimbursed to the department by a party that obtains the director's approval of remedial actions pursuant to this subsection constitute remedial action costs that may be recovered from responsible parties.

C. Any person who is a defendant in an enforcement proceeding brought under section 49-287 may join in the action any other person who is or may be a responsible party.

D. Except as prescribed by section 49-283.01, this article does not affect or modify in any way the obligations or liability of any person, by reason of subrogation or otherwise, under any other provision of state or federal law, including common law, for damages, injury or loss resulting from a release of any hazardous substance or for remedial action costs, except that any person who receives compensation for remedial action costs pursuant to this article is precluded from recovering compensation for the same remedial action costs pursuant to any other federal or state law. Any person who receives compensation for remedial action costs pursuant to any other federal or state law is precluded from receiving compensation for the same remedial action costs as provided in this article.

E. In allocating several liability between two or more potentially responsible parties, the department, an allocator pursuant to section 49-287.06 or a court shall consider the following to determine each responsible party's allocated shares and the orphan shares:

1. The amount and concentration of each hazardous substance involved.

2. The degree of toxicity of each hazardous substance involved.

3. The degree of involvement by the responsible parties in the generation, transportation, treatment, storage or disposal of the hazardous substance.

F. After the allocated shares and the orphan shares are determined pursuant to subsection E of this section and reduced to writing, the department, an allocator or the court may consider the following factors to adjust the allocated shares of the responsible parties, except that any adjustment under this subsection shall not adjust the amount allocated to orphan shares:

1. The magnitude of the risk to human health or the environment caused by each hazardous substance involved.

2. The degree of cooperation by the responsible party with federal, state or local officials to prevent any harm to the public health or the environment.

3. Any other factors deemed relevant by the department, an allocator or the court in determining the liability of the parties under this section.

G. An action brought by a person other than the state to recover remedial action costs from a responsible party shall be brought within three years of the completion of the remedial action or within six years of the initiation of on-site physical construction activities for the remediation, removal or disposal of hazardous substances, whichever is earlier.

H. In an action brought for recovery of remedial action costs incurred at a site not on the registry maintained pursuant to section 49-287.01 or that is brought pursuant to section 49-287.07, subsection A, paragraph 3, subdivision (a), (b) or (d), the court shall initially allocate costs among the responsible parties based on the factors listed in subsection E of this section. To the extent that the allocation results in costs being allocated to orphan shares, those costs shall be reallocated to the responsible parties based on such equitable factors as the court deems appropriate, including:

1. The factors listed in subsection F of this section.

2. Each responsible party's ability to pay.

3. The degree of care exercised by each responsible party with respect to the hazardous substance of concern and taking into account the characteristics of that substance.

#### Section 49-285.01. Prospective purchaser agreements; assignment; notice; fees; rules

A. The department may provide, pursuant to section 49-292, to a prospective purchaser of a facility a written release and a covenant not to sue and may also agree to seek an order of the court granting approval of a settlement that includes immunity from contribution claims for any potential liability for existing contamination under this article or CERCLA if all of the following conditions are met:

1. The facility is within a site identified on the registry maintained by the department pursuant to section 49-287.01 or the department has been provided sufficient information to reasonably identify the extent of the contamination at the facility.

2. The person is not currently liable for an existing or threatened release of a hazardous substance at the facility.

3. The proposed redevelopment or reuse of the facility will not contribute to or exacerbate existing known contamination or unreasonably interfere with remedial measures necessary at the facility or cause the contamination to present a substantial health risk to the public.

4. The agreement will provide a substantial public benefit that may include any of the following:

(a) An agreement by the prospective purchaser to provide substantial funding or other resources to perform or facilitate remedial measures at the facility pursuant to this chapter.

(b) An agreement by the prospective purchaser to perform substantial remedial measures at the facility pursuant to this chapter.

(c) Productive reuse of a vacant or abandoned industrial or commercial facility.

(d) Development of a facility by a governmental entity or nonprofit organization to address an important public purpose.

(e) Creation of conservation or recreation areas.

5. The department consults with local planning and zoning authorities with jurisdiction over the facility and considers reasonably anticipated future land uses at the facility and surrounding properties.

B. If the prospective purchaser of a facility is affiliated with any other person who is a party responsible for the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance under this chapter, through any familial relationship or any corporate or contractual relationship other than a contract to protect a security interest, the director may refuse to provide a written release or covenant not to sue or may refuse to seek an order of the court granting immunity from contribution claims under this section.

C. An agreement between the department and a prospective purchaser shall include provisions deemed necessary by the department and may include:

1. A representation by the prospective purchaser that the purchaser did not cause or contribute to the contamination or otherwise cause or contribute to a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at the property before the purchaser acquired title.

2. If the prospective purchaser does not undertake remedial action, a representation that the purchaser will not exacerbate or contribute to the existing contamination.

3. An agreement that any activity that the prospective purchaser may conduct or direct on the contaminated property will not unreasonably interfere with any ongoing remedial actions that are being performed by a responsible party or the department and that the purchaser will cooperate with those activities.

4. An agreement to undertake those measures that constitute a public benefit as prescribed by subsection A, paragraph 4 of this section.

5. If remedial measures are to be performed under the agreement, an agreement to perform those measures in compliance with the applicable statutes and rules, including sections 49-151 and 49-152, and if pursuant to a consent judgment, under the department's supervision.

6. Unless the contamination was caused by this state, a waiver by the person of any claim or cause of action against this state that arises from contamination at the facility that exists as of the date of acquisition of ownership or operation of the facility.

7. A grant of an easement to the department and its authorized representatives for purposes of ensuring compliance with the agreement or for remedial measures authorized pursuant to this article in connection with contamination at the facility as of the date of acquisition of ownership or operation of the facility.

8. A reservation of rights as to any person who is not a party to the agreement.

9. The legal description of the property.

10. In any case in which the state conducts remedial actions and there are unrecovered response costs at a property for which the prospective purchaser is not liable, the state as a condition of the agreement may impose a lien upon that property for the unrecovered costs.  The priority of the lien is as of the date the lien is recorded in the county where the property is located.  The lien becomes due on the sale, assignment or transfer of the property by the prospective purchaser unless the new purchaser, assignee or transferor accepts and assumes the lien as a personal obligation with the department's prior written agreement.

D. Subject to satisfactory performance of the obligations under the agreement, the prospective purchaser is not liable to this state under this article for any release of a hazardous substance at the facility that exists on the date of acquisition of ownership or operation of the facility. The person shall bear the burden of proving that any hazardous substance existed on the facility as a result of releases of the hazardous substance before the date of acquisition of ownership or operation of the facility. This release from liability may be voided by the director if the person fails to perform any of the provisions of the prospective purchaser agreement.

E. The purchaser shall provide written notice to the department of any sale, assignment or other transfer of the property at least fifteen business days before the date of the transfer.

F. An agreement pursuant to this section is assignable if the assignee qualifies pursuant to subsections A and B of this section for a prospective purchaser agreement under this section and notice is given to the department as prescribed by subsection E of this section. On assignment, the assignee assumes the obligations and the benefits of the agreement. Unless the assignor has breached the agreement, the assignor retains the benefits of the agreement.

G. The department shall provide notice of a prospective purchaser agreement by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the property is located at least fifteen business days before the execution of a prospective purchaser agreement. The notice shall include a general description of the contents of the agreement. Any interested person may comment on the proposed agreement in writing to the director.

H. The department may charge a reasonable fee for the preparation and execution of a prospective purchaser agreement. The director may adopt rules to implement this section.

#### Section 49-286. Mitigation of non-hazardous releases

A. If the director determines that a drinking water source is being or is about to be rendered unusable without treatment as a drinking water source by a non-hazardous substance that was disposed by a person that would be a responsible party under section 49-283 if the substance were a hazardous substance, the director may order that person to perform one or more of the following mitigation measures:

1. Providing an alternative water supply.

2. Mixing or blending if economically practicable.

3. Economically and technically practicable treatment before ingesting the water.

4. Such other mutually agreeable mitigation measures as are necessary to achieve the purposes of this section.

B. The director's selection of mitigation measures shall balance the short-term and long-term public benefits of mitigation with the cost of each alternative measure. The director may only require the least costly alternative if more than one alternative may render water usable as a drinking water source.

C. A mitigation order issued under this section is enforceable under sections 49-261 and 49-264.

 

#### Section 49-287. Enforcement; use of fund; inspections and information gathering; civil penalties

A. Except as provided in section 49-286, the provisions of this article are independent of and are not subject to the enforcement remedies of article 4 of this chapter and section 49-264.

B. This section does not preclude the director from initiating actions pursuant to section 505 of the clean water act and section 1449 of the safe drinking water act. The director shall not initiate any action under section 107(a) or 107(f) of CERCLA or section 7002 of the resource conservation and recovery act to the extent that the action is inconsistent with this article, except under any of the following circumstances:

1. In an action initiated by the director filing a complaint contemporaneously with a consent decree or any other agreement to provide contribution protection or a covenant not to sue under CERCLA.

2. In an action involving a facility at a site listed on the national priorities list on April 29, 1997. In an action involving a facility at a site on the national priorities list that is listed after April 29, 1997 the director may initiate an action if the facility is not being remediated pursuant to this article or any other provision of this title.

3. In a counterclaim action when the state is sued under section 107 (a) of CERCLA, but only against the party asserting the claim. For purposes of this paragraph, "state" does not include political subdivisions of the state.

C. The director may initiate an action to recover natural resource damages under section 107(f) of CERCLA but may recover only the proportionate share of these damages from a defendant who is also a responsible party under this article.

D. Judicial actions initiated pursuant to this section have precedence over all other civil proceedings.

E. If there is a release or the threat of a release of a hazardous substance which may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment:

1. The director may take such remedial action as he deems necessary to protect the public health or welfare or the environment.

2. The attorney general may request a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, a permanent injunction or any other relief necessary to protect the public health or welfare or the environment from the release.

3.

(a) The reasons for the remedial action.

(b) A reasonable time for beginning and completing the actions, taking into account the urgency of the actions for protecting public health or welfare or the environment.

(c) The steps taken to comply with the criteria listed in and rules adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06.

(d) The intention of this state or a political subdivision to take remedial action and the possible liability of the responsible party for the costs of such actions if that action is not taken by the responsible party.

4. The director may take action pursuant to sections 49-287.01 through 49-287.07, or enter into a settlement under section 49-292 or any other applicable provision of this article. Actions taken by the director pursuant to sections 49-287.01 through 49-287.07 may substantially affect the rights and obligations of persons who may be liable under this article for the release or threatened release of a hazardous substance at a site or portion of a site for purposes of determining insurance coverage. Any action taken by the director pursuant to sections 49-287.01 through 49-287.07 is not appealable unless otherwise provided in this article.

F. A remedial action order issued under subsection E of this section becomes final and enforceable in the superior court for purposes of subsections I and J of this section unless, within thirty days after the receipt of the order, the recipient moves to quash or modify the order in the superior court. If the motion to quash or modify the order raises issues of fact, the recipient of the order and the state are entitled to conduct expedited discovery on application to the court and are entitled to a priority for trial. A party who undertakes the actions prescribed in a remedial action order issued pursuant to this section may obtain a court order to recover from the fund the reasonable and necessary costs of the actions if the party demonstrates to the court that the actions required by the order were arbitrary and capricious or otherwise were not in accordance with law, that the party is not a responsible party as prescribed by section 49-283 or for the amount of costs incurred that exceeded the party's share of liability pursuant to section 49-285.

G. If there is a release or the threat of a release of any pollutant which may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare, the director may take such remedial action as he deems necessary to protect the public health or welfare or the environment.

H. Any remedial action costs, other than nonrecoverable costs, incurred by the director pursuant to the procedures in subsection E of this section may be recovered in a civil action brought by the attorney general against any responsible party pursuant to section 49-287.07.

I. A responsible party who wilfully violates or fails or refuses to comply with any order of the director under subsection E, paragraph 3 of this section may, in an action brought in the superior court in the appropriate county to enforce such order, be assessed a civil penalty of not more than five thousand dollars for each day in which the violation occurs or the failure to comply continues. All civil penalties assessed pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund.

J. A responsible party who fails, without sufficient cause, to properly provide remedial action on order of the director pursuant to subsection E, paragraph 3 of this section may be liable to this state for punitive damages in an amount up to three times the amount of any costs incurred by the director as a result of the failure to take proper action. The attorney general may commence a civil action against the responsible party to recover the remedial action costs and the punitive damages. Any punitive damages received by this state pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund. The director's failure to comply with the requirements of section 49-282.06 or the director's order to take a remedial action that causes the responsible party to incur costs that exceed the responsible party's proportionate share of liability pursuant to section 49-285 is a defense to an action for punitive damages and the amount of the punitive damages requested may be reduced, in full or in part.

K. If the director may act pursuant to this section, he may undertake such investigations, monitoring, surveys, testing and other information gathering as he may deem necessary or appropriate to identify the existence and extent of the release or threat of a release, the source and nature of the hazardous substances and the extent of danger to the public health or welfare or to the environment. In addition, the director may undertake such planning, legal, fiscal, economic, engineering, architectural and other studies or investigations as he may deem necessary or appropriate to plan and direct remedial actions, to recover the costs of remedial actions, other than nonrecoverable costs, and to enforce this article.

#### Section 49-287.01. Investigation scoring and site registry; no further action

A. When information of a possible release or threatened release of a hazardous substance is received, the director may conduct a preliminary investigation to obtain additional information necessary to determine the potential risk to the public health or welfare or the environment in order to score the site or portion of the site and include it on the site registry. By written agreement, the director may allow any person to conduct any portion of the preliminary investigation.

B. After completing the preliminary investigation or at any time during the preliminary investigation, the director may suspend or terminate an investigation or determine that no further investigation or action is necessary. The director may reopen the preliminary investigation on a determination that the release or threatened release continues to present an imminent and substantial threat to the public health or welfare or the environment.  If a preliminary investigation is completed, the director shall prepare a draft of the site registry report required under subsection D of this section.  If the director drafts a site registry report pursuant to this section, the report shall contain a description of the site or portion of the site, including its geographical boundaries, and a score in accordance with the site scoring method established in rules adopted by the director.

C. Before finalizing the report and the score, the director shall furnish a copy to the current owners and operators of the site or portion of the site, if known, and shall provide fifteen days for review and comment. The director shall then place a copy in the public file and shall publish the score in a newspaper of general circulation within the county in which the site is located.  The director shall provide thirty days for comment and shall consider any comments before issuing the final report and score.

D. The director shall maintain a registry of scored sites or portions of sites that includes a brief description of the site or portion of the site, its score and a brief description of the status of investigative and remedial actions.  The scoring of a site or portion of the site, its relative score or its placement on the registry does not necessarily represent a determination that the release of a hazardous substance from the site poses a threat to human health or welfare or the environment.  Prior to approving any remedy that may result in water quality exceeding water quality standards after completion of the remedy, the director shall place a notice in the registry established pursuant to this subsection that the remedy may result in water quality exceeding water quality standards.

E. New scores shall be added to the registry as soon as practicable. The registry shall be published annually by the secretary of state in the Arizona administrative register.  The department shall also publish notice of the availability of the registry in a newspaper of general statewide circulation.

F. Any person may request that the director make a determination that a site or portion of a site requires no further action or should be rescored. The request shall include information, including the specific hazardous substances released at or from the site or portion of the site, and a geographical description of the site or portion of the site sufficient for a determination by the director regarding the requested action. The director may request additional information from the requesting party within ninety days after receiving the party's request, and the director shall provide the reasons for requesting the additional information.  The person making the request shall submit the additional information within sixty days after receiving the director's request for additional information.  Within thirty days of receipt of the additional information, the director shall notify the requesting party if the additional information is complete.  The submission of incomplete information may result in a denial of the no further action request.  The parties may agree in writing to additional time for responses. In addition to requesting information, the director or the director's authorized representative may conduct an investigation of the site or portion of the site and shall be given access to the portion of the site under the control of the requestor.  The director or the director's authorized representative shall be allowed access to the site as a requirement for making a no further action request.  The director shall deny a request for a no further action determination if access to the site is not provided.  A request pursuant to this subsection may only be made once per calendar year. After determining that the information submitted is sufficient for action on the request, the director shall publish notice of the request for rescoring or determination of no further action on a site or portion of the site and shall provide thirty days for public comment.  Based on the information and comments received, and within sixty days after the close of the public comment period, unless extended by the director for good cause, the director shall determine whether the score should be changed or a determination of no further action should be made and shall give notice of that decision to the person who made the request and any persons who provided comment.  The director shall make a final decision on a no further action or rescoring request within three hundred days after receiving the request unless the time is extended in writing by the parties.  The director's decision shall contain the factual, technical and legal grounds for the decision. Any changes to a score or determinations of no further action shall be published in the registry.

G. A determination of no further action shall be made if the director finds that the site or portion of the site does not present a significant risk to the public health or welfare or the environment. The director's determination on a no further action request shall be based on the rules adopted by the department pursuant to section 49-282.06.  A determination of no further action shall state whether it is for soils or the groundwater, or both.  A determination of no further action regarding a site or a portion of the site means that the department shall not proceed with or require further remedial action under this article for the specific hazardous substances within the geographical area covered by the determination, provided that the determination of no further action does not preclude the director from obtaining access to the area covered by the determination under this article or any other law.  The department may reopen an investigation and take or require remedial action for any of the following reasons:

1. On discovery of new information that, based on the rules adopted by the department pursuant to section 49-282.06, would result in the potential denial of a no further action request.

2. That information submitted to the director pursuant to subsection F of this section was inaccurate, misleading or incomplete.

3. The reopening of an investigation or the taking of a remedial action is necessary to respond to a release or the threat of a release of a hazardous substance that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment.

H. The director's decision under subsection F of this section may be appealed pursuant to section 49-298, subsection B by the person who made the request or any party who will be adversely affected by the action and who submitted comments.  A person who has previously filed an administrative appeal under this subsection or any provision of law in effect on or after April 29, 1997 concerning previous investigations by the director that resulted in the director's decision being upheld bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the director's action that is being appealed was unsupported by the evidence in any further administrative appeals involving the same site or portion of the site and shall pay the director's cost of reviewing the request and the director's attorney fees and costs incurred in the appeal if the director's decision is upheld.

I. If the director determines that remediation of a site or a portion of a site will be addressed pursuant to a provision of this title other than this article, the director may suspend any further investigation or action under this article.  If the site or portion of a site is listed on the registry, the suspension shall be reflected on the registry.

J. If a site has been placed on the registry and the director determines that remediation of a site or a portion of a site will be addressed pursuant to a provision of this title other than this article, the director may remove the site from the registry.

K. If the director determines that a site on the registry does not require further remedial action under this article, the director may remove the site from the registry.

L. The director shall maintain a list of sites removed from the registry.  This list shall be available to the public.

M. A site that has been removed from the registry may be reopened and remedial action taken or required for any of the following reasons:

1. On discovery of new information that, based on the rules adopted by the department pursuant to section 49-282.06, would result in the potential denial of a no further action request.

2. Information submitted to the director pursuant to this section is inaccurate, misleading or incomplete.

3. The reopening of an investigation or the taking of a remedial action is necessary to respond to a release or the threatened release of a hazardous substance that may present an imminent and substantial danger to the public health or welfare or the environment.

#### Section 49-287.02. Responsible party search

A. If the director determines that a remedial investigation at a site or portion of the site may be necessary and the director determines that cost recovery may be appropriate, the department shall conduct an investigation to identify any person who may be liable under this article. The department shall use its best efforts to identify all persons who may be liable under this article for the release or threatened release at the site or portion of the site.

B. During the investigation, any person may provide the director with information regarding the identification and potential liability of any person or regarding any facility within the site from which a release of a hazardous substance may have occurred. If the director receives sufficient information, the director shall investigate the facts relating to the person's potential liability, including its share of liability under this article, without regard to the financial ability of the person. If the director receives sufficient information regarding a release of a hazardous substance from a facility within the site to indicate that it has contributed to contaminants of concern at the site or portion of the site being investigated pursuant to this section, the director shall investigate the release of the hazardous substance and the potential liability of persons under this article. If the director declines to investigate a person or facility, the director shall notify the person who provided the information of the director's decision not to investigate.

C. If the director declines to investigate a person or facility, any person who conducts an investigation and provides the results of the investigation to the director shall receive a credit for the reasonable and necessary cost of the investigation as an offset against any liability to the fund or to the state under this article if the investigation results in a settlement or a finding by the director, the allocator or the court that this additional identified person is liable under this article with respect to the site or portion of the site being investigated pursuant to this section.

#### Section 49-287.03. Remedial investigation and feasibility study

A. The department may conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study of a scored site or portion of the site to assess conditions on the site or portion of the site and to evaluate alternative potential remedies to the extent necessary to select a final remedy in a manner consistent with the rules and procedures adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06.

B. Unless the director determines that the necessary remedial action can be completed within one hundred eighty days, before the department begins a remedial investigation and feasibility study for a site or a portion of a site, the department shall prepare a scope of work, a fact sheet and an outline of a community involvement plan.  The scope of work shall generally describe the proposed scope of the remedial investigation and feasibility study.  The outline of the community involvement plan shall address all of the elements of the community involvement plan requirements of section 49-289.03.

C. The department shall provide written notice to each person who, according to information available to the department, may be liable under this article that the scope of work is available for inspection and that any person by agreement with the department may develop and implement a work plan for the remedial investigation and the feasibility study. The department shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the site is located a notice of the availability of the scope of work, fact sheet and outline of a community involvement plan for public comment. The notice shall provide an opportunity for a public meeting.

D. The department shall prepare a responsiveness summary before implementing the scope of work.  Before the director implements a remedial investigation, unless the director determines that the necessary remedial action can be completed within one hundred eighty days, the department shall prepare and implement the community involvement plan based upon the outline and after considering the public comments, consistent with the requirements of section 49-289.03.  The department shall update the community involvement plan at least every two years.

E. The remedial investigation shall collect the data necessary to adequately characterize the site or the portion of the site for the purpose of developing and evaluating effective remediation alternatives pursuant to the feasibility study requirements prescribed by subsection F of this section.

F. The feasibility study shall be fully integrated with the results of the remedial investigation and shall include an alternative screening step to select a reasonable number of alternatives in a manner consistent with the rules and procedures adopted pursuant to section 49-282.06.

 

#### Section 49-287.04. Proposed remedial action plan; preliminary list of responsible parties; opportunity to comment; record of decision; appeal

A. After evaluating the site or portion of a site under section 49-287.03, the director shall prepare a proposed remedial action plan that describes all of the following:

1. The boundaries of the site or portion of the site that is the subject of the remedial action.

2. The results of the remedial investigation and feasibility study.

3. The proposed remedy and its estimated costs.

4. How the remediation goals and selection factors in section 49-282.06 and rules adopted by the director have been considered.

B. The director shall issue notice of the proposed remedial action plan pursuant to the community involvement plan.  The notice shall:

1. Describe the proposed remedy and its estimated cost.

2. Identify where the proposed remedial action plan and remedial investigation and feasibility study report may be inspected.

3. Advise the public of the opportunity to provide comments on the proposed remedial action plan and the closing date for those comments.

C. A copy of the proposed remedial action plan shall also be sent to each person on the preliminary list of potentially responsible parties with a notice that includes the information required in subsection B of this section and that also shall:

1. Notify the recipients of the opportunity to propose alternative methods of allocation of liability among responsible parties.

2. Provide a preliminary list of potentially responsible parties and summarize the basis for each party's liability if the director determines that cost recovery may be appropriate.

3. Advise the recipient that all information known to the recipient regarding a person who may be liable under this article and any facility within the site from which a release of a hazardous substance may have occurred must be provided to the department within a reasonable period of time set by the department, but not less than sixty days.  Failure to comply with this subsection precludes a person from introducing the evidence in an allocation hearing pursuant to section 49-287.06, and in an action brought pursuant to section 49-287.07, except as otherwise prescribed by those sections.

D. Within ninety days after the end of the public comment period, if the department has received sufficient information pursuant to section 49-287.02, subsection B identifying additional persons who may be responsible under this article or facilities where a release of a hazardous substance may have occurred, the director shall investigate that person or facility within the site as provided in section 49-287.02, subsection A or shall decline to investigate and shall notify the person providing the information in writing of the director's decision.

E. If, on the basis of new information or its investigation, the department believes there is sufficient evidence that an identified person is a responsible party under this article, the department shall provide the notice and proposed remedial action plan required by subsection C of this section to that party and a revised list of potentially responsible parties to the parties originally identified in the proposed remedial action plan.  A newly identified potentially responsible party shall have the same opportunity for comment and the submission of information including information concerning additional responsible parties or releasing facilities as provided to the originally identified responsible parties under this section.  If as a result of the submission of information by subsequently identified responsible parties or its own investigation the department believes that there are additional responsible parties, it shall provide the notice required by this subsection to those parties and the previously identified responsible parties and shall comply with the other procedures prescribed by this section.

F. After the conclusion of all public comment periods prescribed by this section, the director shall prepare a comprehensive responsiveness summary. The director shall prepare the record of decision regarding the remedial action plan.

G. The director shall serve written notice that a record of decision has been signed upon each person who submitted written comments on the proposed remedy selection and all persons identified as potentially responsible parties. A notice shall be published pursuant to the community involvement plan informing the public that the record of decision and comprehensive responsiveness summary have been prepared and are available for review.

H. A record of decision signed by the director is deemed to be a final administrative decision as defined in section 41-1092 as of the date it is served pursuant to subsection G of this section. There is no right to an administrative appeal, review or rehearing by the director on the record of decision. Any person who will be adversely affected by the record of decision and who commented on the proposed remedial action plan pursuant to this section may seek judicial review of the record of decision by filing a complaint in superior court pursuant to section 12-904, subsection A. The plaintiff shall serve the notice required by section 12-904, subsection B on the director.

I. If a complaint is filed pursuant to subsection H of this section, the court action is stayed and no answer is required until twenty days after one of the following events occurs:

1. Ninety days after notice of the allocator's report is served pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection G.

2. Notice that no allocation hearing will be held is served pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection A.

3. Notice of termination of an allocation hearing is served pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection I.

4. The director moves that the stay should be lifted and the court grants the motion.

J. If a complaint is filed pursuant to subsection H of this section, the director shall serve any notice required by section 49-287.06, subsection A, E or G on each person who commented on the proposed remedial action plan.

K. The director shall notify all parties to an appeal if the director intends to implement the remedy before the stay under subsection I of this section is lifted.  If the director gives this notice, the stay of the action pursuant to subsection I of this section does not preclude any party from seeking a preliminary injunction against the director from implementing the remedy.

L. On termination of the stay of an action pursuant to subsection I of this section, the director shall transmit the record to the superior court.  The record shall consist of the proposed remedial action plan, copies of all written comments on the proposed remedial action plan, the comprehensive responsiveness summary and the record of decision.  Judicial review shall be pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.  If an evidentiary hearing is held pursuant to section 12-910, subsection A, then notwithstanding section 12-910, subsection B, no evidence may be admitted by the court unless it supports a specific comment made before the conclusion of the public comment period pursuant to this section by the party seeking to introduce the evidence.  Section 12-910, subsection C does not apply to the appeal.

 

#### Section 49-287.05. Notice of liability allocation; eligibility

A. After signing the record of decision, if the director determines that cost recovery may be appropriate, the director shall notify each person that has been determined to be liable under this article of the following:

1. The boundaries of the site or portion of the site that is the subject of the notice.

2. The basis on which the director has determined the person to be a responsible party.

3. The names and addresses of all other persons who the director has determined to be responsible parties.

4. The method of allocation chosen by the director, the reason it was chosen and the percentage share of remedial action costs for which the department has determined each person to be liable, which shall total one hundred per cent. For each person's share, the department shall state the reasons for the consideration given to the factors of section 49-285, subsections E and F.

5. The record of decision selecting the remedial action and the estimated cost of the remedy. A copy of the record of decision and comprehensive responsiveness summary shall be included. The record of decision shall demonstrate that the requirements of section 49-282.06 were considered.

6. A list of all remedial action costs, other than nonrecoverable costs, incurred by the director at the site that is the subject of the notice.

7. A list of costs of approved remedial actions, other than nonrecoverable costs, incurred by the state or an eligible party at the site that is the subject of the notice.

8. A statement of the person's right to an allocation hearing pursuant to section 49-287.06 and the availability of a settlement pursuant to section 49-292, 49-292.01 or 49-292.02.

9. An offer to settle the person's liability pursuant to this article and CERCLA with respect to the site or portion of the site if the person agrees to pay seventy-five per cent of the share of remedial action costs allocated to the person by the department. If the settlement allows payment over time or satisfaction by performance of future work, the settlement shall be conditioned on the person making a substantial down payment and providing financial assurance that it can meet its obligations to satisfy the remainder of its share under the agreement. Each settlement shall be conditioned on cooperating with the department with respect to further proceedings under this article including providing access to its property for the remedial action and complying with section 49-288 except that the person may reserve the right to challenge the remedy selection. The department's offer to settle expires unless the written acceptance is received by the director within one hundred twenty days after service of notice on the person pursuant to this subsection. Any person who has been penalized under section 49-288, subsection G is not eligible to obtain a settlement under this paragraph. Settlements under this paragraph are voidable at the director's discretion if the settling party institutes an action to recover remedial action costs or response costs incurred at the subject site or facility before the time specified under section 49-287.07, subsection B.

B. If a person cannot be notified of the department's determination pursuant to this section because it no longer exists or cannot be found after reasonable efforts by the department, the department is relieved of its obligation to notify that person.

C. If a person accepts the department's offer to settle pursuant to this section within the time allowed, the department shall enter into a settlement with the person pursuant to section 49-292. The settlement shall include a covenant by the state not to sue under this article or CERCLA and, at the option of the person and subject to court approval, protection from contribution actions under this article and CERCLA. The department may revoke the settlement if the person and the department are unable to agree to reasonable terms and conditions of settlement within ninety days after the offer is accepted.

#### Section 49-287.06. Allocation hearing

A. Ninety days after the issuance of notice pursuant to section 49-287.05, subsection A, the director shall issue a notice to each person who has not settled its liability with the department of the start of an allocation proceeding. The director shall propose the names of at least three allocators taken from a list maintained by the director. The director shall be entitled to be represented in the allocation proceeding but may waive this right. If all parties have settled, the director's notice shall advise all persons notified pursuant to section 49-287.05 that no allocation hearing will be held pursuant to this section.

B. Within fifteen days of receipt, each person receiving the notice of allocation proceeding shall respond to the director regarding the acceptability of any of the allocators on the director's list. If all of the parties cannot agree on one of the allocators proposed by the director, each party may provide the names of up to three other proposed allocators. If the director and all of the parties cannot agree on a proposed allocator within thirty days after the issuance of the director's notice pursuant to this section, the director shall request the presiding civil judge of the superior court in the county where the site is located to select an allocator. Within thirty days after the request, the presiding civil judge shall select an allocator and advise the director of the selection.

C. The director shall give all parties written notice of the selection of the allocator. The allocator shall set the date for hearing at least sixty and not more than one hundred twenty days after the date of the notice of selection of the allocator pursuant to this section. The allocator may continue the date of the hearing for good cause. Ex parte contact with the allocator regarding any of the evidence or issues in the allocation is prohibited.

D. The allocator shall conduct an allocation hearing and, on request of one or more of the parties, may conduct a mediation or settlement conference before the allocation hearing. The allocator has the power to administer oaths or affirmations to witnesses. In conducting the allocation hearing, the allocator has discretion to determine the procedures to be followed, except that:

1. Each party shall provide the allocator, the director and all parties with a disclosure statement at least thirty days before the date of the first scheduled hearing. The disclosure statement shall comply with rule 26.1, Arizona rules of civil procedure, and shall include a statement of the method of allocation proposed, a description of evidence supporting the factors listed in section 49-285, subsections E and F intended to be presented at the hearing and a description of any other relevant evidence known to the party, including information regarding the responsibility of any other person. Copies of any documentary evidence shall be included with the disclosure statement unless already in the department's public file on the site or a disclosure statement previously filed pursuant to this paragraph. Evidence that is not disclosed in a party's disclosure statement is inadmissible by that party at the hearing. Evidence that a party failed to provide the director pursuant to a request under section 49-288 is inadmissible by that party at the hearing. The liability allocation notice issued by the director pursuant to section 49-287.05, subsection A and the public record on file at the department may serve as the disclosure statement of the director and any persons who have settled their liability with the director. The director may supplement the liability allocation notice up to thirty days prior to the first scheduled hearing date. The allocator shall resolve disputes regarding the adequacy of disclosure statements.

2. The director has the burden of proving that all other parties are responsible parties under this article. The allocator shall allow each party to present evidence relevant to the liability and proportionate share of liability of any person, except as provided in paragraphs 8 and 9 of this subsection. There is no burden of proof as to the proportionate share of any person. The allocator shall hear all of the evidence and assign the proportionate shares in accordance with the considerations as specified in section 49-285, subsections E and F.

3. The allocator shall allow each party to cross-examine any other party's witnesses, except that the allocator may limit cross-examination to avoid needless delay or a needless presentation of cumulative evidence or to expedite the hearing.

4. The allocator may issue subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents. The subpoenas shall be served and, on application to the superior court, enforced in the manner provided by law for the service and enforcement of subpoenas in civil actions. Service of the subpoena is the responsibility of the person requesting the subpoena. Discovery shall not be permitted except on a showing of good cause and due diligence as determined by the allocator.

5. The allocator may request any additional information from any party if the allocator believes that this information is necessary to assist in making a determination regarding liability or the share of any person.

6. If, during the hearing or at its conclusion, the allocator believes that additional information is necessary to issue a report, the allocator may order the parties to exchange additional information and submit posthearing evidence for a period of not more than sixty days.

7. The allocator shall use the Arizona rules of civil procedure as guidance for hearing procedures, but may depart from these rules as prompt and fair resolution of the issues demand, and shall honor all privileges recognized under Arizona law. The allocator may allow any relevant evidence, including hearsay evidence, to be admitted and shall give appropriate weight to all of the evidence. The allocator may impose time limits on individual presentations and may require the consolidation of presentations or cross-examination if this consolidation can be justified by commonality of interests. The disclosure statements and the liability allocation notice sent by the director pursuant to section 49-287.05 shall be admitted as evidence. The proceeding shall be recorded by a court reporter upon request by any party who agrees to pay the costs.

8. Except on a showing of good cause and due diligence as determined by the allocator, a party may not allege that a person is responsible for a share of liability unless that person was named in the director's list of liable persons issued pursuant to section 49-287.05 or was identified as a potentially liable person pursuant to section 49-287.04.

9. A party may not introduce evidence at the hearing regarding the liability or share of liability of any person under this article unless the director was notified of the existence of the information pursuant to section 49-287.04. The allocator may allow the introduction of that evidence if the party acquired the information after that time and if the party shows good cause and due diligence as determined by the allocator, if the party provided the evidence to the director promptly after it was acquired.

E. Within sixty days after the hearing or, if applicable, the end of the period for submitting posthearing evidence, the allocator shall issue a written allocation report identifying the persons who are liable and the proportionate share of liability of each person in accordance with section 49-285, subsections E and F in percentages adding up to one hundred per cent. The allocator shall send a copy of the report to each party.

F. All parties to the allocation shall bear an equal share of the allocator's fees and costs, which shall be specified in the allocator's report.

G. The director shall serve notice of the issuance of the allocator's report on all persons notified pursuant to subsection A of this section and on the persons who filed an appeal of the record of decision pursuant to section 49-287.04. The notice shall state that there shall be a period of ninety days after service of the notice for settlement discussions, that the allocator's findings are final unless a challenge is filed pursuant to section 49-287.07 and the period for challenging the allocator's findings as provided in section 49-287.07, subsection B.

H. The findings regarding liability and the proportionate share of liability for each person as set forth in the allocator's report are final unless a timely challenge regarding a person's liability or proportionate share is filed as provided in section 49-287.07, subsection B. The director or any other person with a claim for recovery of remedial action costs against a responsible party whose proportionate share as found by the allocator has become final pursuant to this subsection may obtain a judgment based on the proportionate share determined in the allocator's report. In any action to obtain such a judgment, the responsible party whose allocated share has become final may not dispute its proportionate share of liability as determined by the allocator, and the plaintiff may recover its costs and attorney fees incurred in obtaining and enforcing the judgment. The liability of any person that has become final pursuant to this subsection is not affected by any subsequent determination by a court in any action.

I. If all parties settle during a proceeding pursuant to this section, the director shall terminate the proceedings. If all parties, not including the director, fail or refuse to participate, the director may proceed with the allocation hearing or may terminate the proceedings. If the director terminates the proceedings, the director shall provide written notice within thirty days of termination of proceedings pursuant to this section to all persons who received notice pursuant to section 49-287.05.

#### Section 49-287.07. Actions for allocation and recovery of remedial action costs; limitation of actions

A. The following actions shall be brought pursuant to this section:

1. An action by the director or any person with a claim for recovery of remedial action costs to challenge a determination of liability or proportionate share in an allocator's report pursuant to section 49-287.06.

2. An action by a person to challenge a determination of its liability or its proportionate share in an allocator's report issued pursuant to section 49-287.06.

3. An action by the director or any person for allocation and recovery of remedial action costs at any site or a portion of a site listed on the registry maintained pursuant to section 49-287.01, subsection D, except as follows:

(a) An action by a person or group of persons who have obtained a no further action determination for a site pursuant to section 49-287.01, subsections F and G, for both soil and groundwater. Such an action may be brought pursuant to section 49-285.

(b) An action by one or more responsible parties who have conducted or will conduct a voluntary remedial action pursuant to section 49-282.05 or who have entered into a settlement or agreement with the director under which the person or group of persons agree to undertake a remedy or any other remedial action and to reimburse the fund for the department's costs, if any. Such an action may be brought pursuant to section 49-285.

(c) An action by the director to enforce a settlement agreement.

(d) An action by the director to recover costs incurred in undertaking an emergency remedial action pursuant to section 49-282.02. Such an action may be brought pursuant to section 49-285.

B. If the action includes a challenge regarding a determination of liability or proportionate share of a party in an allocator's report pursuant to section 49-287.06, the action shall be commenced by filing a complaint not fewer than ninety days nor more than one hundred twenty days after notice of the allocator's report is served pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection G. If the director issues a notice of termination of allocation proceedings pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection I, the action may be brought any time after that notice is served. In all other cases, actions brought pursuant to this section shall be filed no fewer than ninety days after notice of the allocator's report is served pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection G. All actions commenced under this section shall be brought in the superior court in the county where the site is located or in which the department maintains an office. Title 12, chapter 7, article 2 and title 41, chapter 6, articles 6 and 10 do not apply to the action. Within five calendar days after filing the complaint, the plaintiff shall serve written notice of the filing of the complaint by certified mail on the director and each person whose liability or proportionate share were determined in the allocator's report. In any action brought pursuant to this section, unless otherwise provided in this section, the parties shall bear their own costs, expert witness fees and attorney fees.

C. A plaintiff who is challenging its own proportionate share or a finding of its liability shall name the director as the defendant. The director or a plaintiff who is seeking recovery of remedial action costs shall name as a defendant each party whose liability or proportionate share as determined by the allocator is being challenged and any other person who the plaintiff alleges is a responsible party and who was not allocated a share of liability by the allocator. The plaintiff shall not name as a defendant any person who has entered into a settlement agreement with the director that includes contribution protection or whose proportionate share or liability as set forth in the allocator's report is not being challenged. On the entry of any judicially approved consent decree providing contribution protection to any defendant regarding the site or portion of the site that is the subject of a challenge under this section, the court shall dismiss that defendant from the action pursuant to this section. The complaint and answer shall be filed and served as provided in the applicable rules of civil procedure. The action shall be tried by the court without a jury.

D. The plaintiff has the burden of proving that each defendant is a responsible party under this article, except that in an action in which a person challenges a determination of its own liability in an allocator's report, the director has the burden of proving that the person is a responsible party under this article. There is no burden of proof as to the proportionate share of any person. The court shall receive evidence offered by any party regarding the allocation of liability among the parties and any other persons, except as provided in subsection I of this section. The liability allocation notice issued pursuant to section 49-287.05, subsection A and the allocator's report issued pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection E shall be admitted as evidence. The court shall issue an order establishing the proportionate share of liability of each party it determines to be a responsible party in accordance with section 49-285, subsections E and F. Notwithstanding a finding regarding the proportionate share of liability that differs from the allocator's report or any settlement, the court's order does not affect the liability of any person who has settled with the department pursuant to this article or whose proportionate share of liability has become final pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection H.

E. In an action challenging a party's proportionate share of liability as determined in the allocator's report, if the party filing the challenge is not the prevailing party as determined by the court, the liability of the parties shall be adjusted pursuant to this subsection. If the parties have filed complaints against each other challenging the allocator's report, no adjustments may be made pursuant to this subsection. The court shall determine whether the plaintiff is the prevailing party based on whether the proportionate share determined by the court is closer to an offer of judgment pursuant to rule 68 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure made by one or both of the parties or to the proportionate share as determined in the allocator's report. If the plaintiff is not the prevailing party, the share of liability of the responsible party whose proportionate share is being challenged shall be adjusted as follows:

1. If the plaintiff is challenging its own proportionate share as stated in the allocator's report, the plaintiff is liable for the proportionate share contained in the court's order plus a premium of two per cent of the total remedial action costs at the site or, if applicable, a portion of the site, unless the court's order is for less than four per cent, then the premium is fifty per cent of the plaintiff's proportionate share as determined by the court.

2. If the plaintiff is the director who is challenging the proportionate share of a defendant, the defendant is liable for the proportionate share contained in the court's order minus a discount of two per cent of the total remedial action costs at the site or, if applicable, a portion of the site, unless the court's order is for less than four per cent, then the discount is fifty per cent of the defendant's proportionate share as determined by the court.

3. If the plaintiff, other than the director, is seeking recovery of remedial action costs and is challenging the proportionate share of a defendant, the defendant is liable for the proportionate share contained in the court's order, and the plaintiff is liable to the defendant for an amount equal to two per cent of the total remedial action costs at the site or, if applicable, a portion of the site.

F. In any action pursuant to this section, including an action to obtain a judgment based on a final allocator's determination pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection H, or in any settlement after the conclusion of the allocation proceeding under section 49-287.06, a party who received notice pursuant to section 49-287.06, subsection A, who did not participate in the allocation proceeding under section 49-287.06 and who is found to be a responsible party under this article is liable for all of the following:

1. Its proportionate share of liability.

2. A premium of fifty per cent of that party's proportionate share.

3. The plaintiff's costs, attorney fees and expert fees incurred in both the allocation proceeding and the court action.

G. In any action brought pursuant to this section, if the superior court finds that a defendant is not a responsible party under this article, the plaintiff is liable for all of that defendant's reasonable costs, attorney fees and expert fees incurred in the court action.

H. If more than one action is filed under this section, the court shall join all actions into a single proceeding.

I. No party may allege that any other person is responsible for any portion of liability unless that person was identified to the director pursuant to section 49-287.04 except on a showing of good cause and due diligence.

J. No determination by the director or an allocator pursuant to this article as to the fact or extent of a person's liability under this article may be admitted into evidence or used in any judicial proceeding initiated against that person other than a proceeding pursuant to this section.

K. In any action brought pursuant to this section, on the request of any party with a claim for recovery of remedial action costs, the court shall award a judgment against the responsible party for its proportionate share of remedial action costs as prescribed by section 49-285. The judgment shall reflect any adjustments of amounts due pursuant to subsections E and F of this section.

#### Section 49-288. Information gathering and access; enforcement; retaliatory action; civil penalties

A. The director may take an action authorized under subsection B or C of this section to determine the need for, to select or to undertake any remedial action pursuant to this article, to investigate and allocate the liability of any person under this article or to otherwise enforce the provisions of this article or a rule adopted pursuant to this article. Any such action taken regarding the release or threatened release of a pollutant shall not require a person to create information or documents not then in existence but may require sorting, organization, compilation or formatting of information in existence.

B. The director may require a person who has or may have information relevant to a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, or pollutant as identified by the director in the request, or the liability of any person under this article including information relating to the ability of a person to pay for or to undertake remedial actions pursuant to this article, to furnish, after reasonable notice, information or documents relating to such release or threatened release or the liability of any person under this article or to grant access at all reasonable times, after reasonable notice, to a facility or other place owned or operated by the person to inspect and copy all documents or records relating to such release or threatened release or the liability of any person under this article. At the option of the person, the person may copy and furnish, at the person's expense, all such documents or records to the director. If any information under this section is claimed confidential pursuant to section 49-205, subsection A, the information shall be provided to the director but not made available to the public pending the determination of confidentiality pursuant to section 49-205. Written notice of the determination regarding confidentiality shall be provided to the person claiming confidentiality. If the person claiming confidentiality does not file an action for declaratory relief in superior court within thirty days of receiving this notice, the information shall be made available to the public.

C. The director or an agent designated by the director with appropriate documentation that identifies the person who has been given authority from the director, after reasonable notice, may enter a facility or other place at reasonable times under any of the following circumstances:

1. Where a hazardous substance or a regulated substance as defined in section 49-1001 may be or has been generated, stored, treated, disposed of or transported from and which may be related to a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance or regulated substance.

2. From which or to which a hazardous substance or a regulated substance as defined in section 49-1001 has been or may have been released or where such release is or may be threatened.

3. Where entry is needed to determine the need for remedial actions or the appropriate remedial actions or to effectuate remedial actions pursuant to this article.

4. To inspect and obtain samples of any suspected hazardous substance or a regulated substance as defined in section 49-1001 which has been or may have been released or where such release is or may be threatened, including samples of containers or labeling.

D. If a sample is obtained pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 4 of this section, the director shall, before leaving the premises, give to the owner, operator or other person in control of the facility or other place from which the samples were obtained a receipt describing the sample obtained and, if requested, a portion of each sample. A copy of the results of any analysis made of such samples shall be furnished promptly to the owner, operator or other person in control, if such person can be located. Inspections pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 4 of this section shall be completed with reasonable promptness.

E. If consent is not granted regarding any request made by the director under subsections A through C of this section, then the director may issue an order requiring compliance with the request within a specified time period that the director determines is appropriate under the circumstances. The order shall provide that the time period for compliance shall be extended for good cause shown as determined by the director. The order may not be issued until an opportunity for consultation as is reasonably appropriate under the circumstances has been afforded to the person to whom the request is made.

F. The director may ask the attorney general to commence a civil action to compel compliance with a request made pursuant to subsections A through C of this section or an order issued pursuant to subsection E of this section.

G. The court may enjoin acts of noncompliance or may assess a civil penalty of not to exceed five thousand dollars for each day of noncompliance against any person who unreasonably fails to comply with an order issued pursuant to subsection E of this section. All civil penalties assessed pursuant to this section shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund. The attorney general, at the request of the director, may commence an action in superior court to recover civil penalties provided for in this subsection. In determining the amount of a civil penalty under this subsection, the court shall consider:

1. The seriousness of the act of noncompliance under this section.

2. As an aggravating factor only, the economic benefit, if any, resulting from the act of noncompliance under this section.

3. Any history of such violation.

4. Any good faith efforts to comply with the order.

5. The economic impact of the penalty on the person.

6. Such other factors as the court deems relevant.

H. No person shall fire or otherwise discriminate against any employee with respect to wages, hours, duties, responsibilities or employment position by reason of the fact that the employee provided information to the state, has testified or may testify, in any administrative, allocation or judicial proceeding commenced pursuant to this article. Any employee alleging a violation of this section may bring an action in superior court to obtain reinstatement, back pay, compensatory damages, and reasonable attorney fees. An action must be commenced within one year of the alleged violation and shall constitute the exclusive recourse for the violation.

I. Nothing in this section shall preclude the director from securing access or obtaining information in any other lawful manner.

A. The director shall assure that remedial actions taken pursuant to this article are pursued and completed as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the criteria in section 49-282.06 and the rules adopted pursuant to that section. A remedial action shall not be financed in whole or in part from monies in the water quality assurance revolving fund unless the remedial action plan proposed pursuant to section 49-287.04, subsection A and each record of decision prepared pursuant to section 49-287.04, subsection F specify:

1. A time for commencing the implementation of the remedy after conclusion of settlements and allocation of liability.

If the director determines that the property is either entirely or partially within the area of contamination or is predicted to be either entirely or partially within the area of contamination within two years, the director shall deny the petition to adjust the boundaries of the site. If the director determines based on the results of the remedial investigation that the property is not within the area of contamination and is not predicted to be within the area of contamination within two years, the director shall grant the petition to adjust the boundaries of the site.

#### Section 49-289.02. Community information; public notice and comment

A. The director shall establish a preliminary community involvement area for each site on the registry established pursuant to section 49-287.01, subsection D, within ninety days after the site is entered into the registry.

B. The director shall provide written notice by mail or other delivery to residents, commercial occupants and owners of wells operated pursuant to groundwater withdrawal rights or permits within a preliminary community involvement area. If two or more community involvement areas are adjacent or overlapping, the director may make a single notice to avoid duplicate notice. This notice shall contain an opportunity for the recipient to elect to be added to the site's mailing list and to identify other persons who should receive similar notice. This notice also shall contain:

#### Section 49-290. Exemption from permit requirements; definition

A. Notwithstanding any other statute, a person who performs a remedial action or a portion of a remedial action that has been approved by the department if that action or portion is conducted in compliance with this article is not subject to any requirement to obtain any permit or approval that may otherwise be required by the department.

B. Except as prescribed in subsection D of this section, a person who conducts a portion of a remedial action, where that portion is entirely on site and is conducted in compliance with this article, may be exempted from a requirement to obtain any other state or local permit or approval, other than any requirement of title 45, at the written request of the person conducting the remedial action.  The written request shall identify the specific permit to be exempted and the reasons the exemption is requested. The permit may be exempted if the director finds both of the following:

1. The requirement does not arise out of any permit or regulatory program that is required pursuant to the laws of the United States.

2. The requirement presents a substantial impediment to effective performance of the remedial action selected by the department.

C. The director may waive any regulatory requirement adopted pursuant to this title with respect to a site or portion of a site as part of a record of decision adopted pursuant to section 49-287.04 for that site or portion of a site if the regulatory requirement conflicts with the implementation of the selected remedy, provided that the waiver does not result in adverse impacts to public health or the environment.  No waiver may be granted under this subsection if it is prohibited by federal law or if the waiver would jeopardize the continued delegation to the state of authority to implement a federal environmental program.

D. Discharge of wastewater to off-site publicly owned treatment works and sewer systems does not constitute an activity conducted entirely on site for purposes of subsection B of this section.

E. The director shall give written notice of any request for exemption made pursuant to subsection B of this section to the remedial action coordinator designated pursuant to subsection G of this section by the governmental entity whose permit requirements are the subject of the request.  Before making any finding pursuant to subsection B of this section, the director or the director's designee shall meet and confer with the remedial action coordinator and the person conducting the remedial action to identify alternatives to exemption.

F. Any finding made by the director pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be in writing.  The governmental entity whose permit requirement is preempted as a result of such finding is not liable for property damage, personal injury damage or violations of state or local law resulting from the exemption.  The director shall notify the affected governmental entity of any finding made pursuant to subsection B of this section.  A finding of the director made pursuant to subsection B of this section is a final administrative decision as defined in section 41-1092 and is subject to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

G. Each city, town and county shall designate a remedial action coordinator who shall have responsibility for monitoring and facilitating any remedial actions conducted within its jurisdiction.  The designated remedial action coordinator shall:

1. Regularly consult, as needed, with the department and the person conducting a remedial action throughout the duration of the remedial action.

2. Expedite the processing and issuance of permits, approvals or other authorizations required by the governmental entity represented by the remedial action coordinator, to facilitate the prompt conduct of a remedial action.

3. Provide information to the department and the person conducting the remedial action regarding applicable requirements of the governmental entity represented by the remedial action coordinator and the potential for waiver of such requirements.

H. In order to encourage remediation activities under this article and to conserve the fund, neither this state nor any county that imposes an excise or similar tax that is levied at a rate applied as a percentage of the rates on each business class subject to the tax imposed by title 42, chapter 5, article 1 may impose a tax on the sale or purchase of tangible personal property incorporated or fabricated into any real property, structure, project, development or improvement under a contract specified in section 42-5075, subsection B, paragraph 6.

I. For purposes of this section, "on site" means the areal extent of contamination and all suitable areas in close proximity to the contamination that are reasonably necessary for implementation of the remedial action.

#### Section 49-290.01. Applicability of requirements; Arizona department of water resources

A. Notwithstanding section 49-290, any person conducting a remedial action shall obtain and comply with applicable permits, approvals or other authorizations required by the department of water resources. On consultation with the director of environmental quality, the director of water resources may waive its applicable permits, approvals or authorizations if the director of water resources determines that the permit, approval or other authorization unreasonably limits the completion of a remedial action and if the waiver does not conflict with the statutory intent of the permit, approval or other authorization. The department of water resources shall expedite the processing and issuance of permits, approvals or authorizations to facilitate the prompt conduct of approved remedial actions. If the department of water resources fails to issue or deny a permit within one hundred twenty days of the date of receipt of a complete application for a permit, approval or authorization required for the remedial action or subsequent implementing work plan approved by the department, the department may authorize the party conducting the approved remedial action to proceed with that action and that person shall not be subject to any penalties for failure to obtain the permit, approval or authorization from the department of water resources, but shall be required to comply with the substantive requirements of such permit, approval or authorization. The determination of whether an application for a permit is complete shall be made by the department of water resources. The person conducting the approved remedial action who uses groundwater withdrawn in an active management area as part of an approved remedial action shall continue to pay the groundwater withdrawal fee for the groundwater the person withdrew and used or received and used.

B. The director of environmental quality and the director of water resources shall enter into a memorandum of understanding which establishes a procedure for expediting the review and issuance of permits issued under title 45 when the director of environmental quality has made a determination that a delay in the issuance of a permit required by title 45 will result in the continuance of an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare or the environment.

C. The director of environmental quality and the director of water resources shall coordinate their efforts to expedite remedial actions, including obtaining information pertinent to site investigations, remedial investigations, site management and beneficial use of remediated water.

D. The director of water resources may waive any regulatory requirement adopted pursuant to title 45 with respect to a site or portion of a site as part of a record of decision adopted pursuant to section 49-287.04 for that site or portion of a site if the regulatory requirement conflicts with the implementation of the selected remedy, provided that the waiver does not result in adverse impacts to other land and water users. No waiver may be granted under this subsection if it is prohibited by federal law or if the waiver would jeopardize the continued delegation to the state of authority to implement a federal environmental program.

#### Section 49-290.02. Applicability of Arizona department of water resources requirements; metal mining facilities

A. A metal mining facility conducting mitigation activities pursuant to an order issued by the director of environmental quality pursuant to section 49-286 shall obtain and comply with applicable permits, approvals or other authorizations required by the department of water resources. On consultation with the director of environmental quality, the director of water resources may waive its applicable permits, approvals or authorizations if the director of water resources determines that the permit, approval or other authorization unreasonably limits the completion of mitigation activities undertaken by a metal mining facility pursuant to an order issued pursuant to section 49-286 and if the waiver does not conflict with the statutory intent of the permit, approval or other authorization. The department of water resources shall expedite the processing and issuance of permits, approvals or authorizations to facilitate the prompt conduct of approved mitigation activities undertaken by a metal mining facility pursuant to an order issued pursuant to section 49-286. If the department of water resources fails to issue or deny a permit within one hundred twenty days of the date of receipt of a complete application for a permit, approval or authorization required for completion of the mitigation activities approved by the department of environmental quality pursuant to an order issued pursuant to section 49-286, the department of environmental quality may authorize the metal mining facility conducting the approved mitigation activities to proceed with those activities and that metal mining facility shall not be subject to any penalties for failure to obtain the permit, approval or authorization from the department of water resources, but shall be required to comply with the substantive requirements of such permit, approval or authorization.  The determination of whether an application for a permit is complete shall be made by the department of water resources. A metal mining facility conducting mitigation activities pursuant to an order issued by the department of environmental quality pursuant to section 49-286 that uses groundwater withdrawn in an active management area shall continue to pay any applicable groundwater withdrawal fee for the groundwater the metal mining facility withdrew and used or received and used.

B. The director of environmental quality and the director of water resources shall coordinate their efforts to expedite mitigation activities undertaken by a metal mining facility pursuant to an order issued pursuant to section 49-286, including obtaining information pertinent to site investigations, site management and beneficial use of water withdrawn for mitigation purposes.

C. With respect to mitigation activities undertaken by a metal mining facility pursuant to an order issued by the department of environmental quality pursuant to section 49-286, the director of water resources may waive any regulatory requirement adopted pursuant to title 45 with respect to a site or portion of a site as part of a mitigation order issued by the department of environmental quality pursuant to section 49-286 for that site or portion of a site if the regulatory requirement conflicts with the implementation of the ordered mitigation activities, provided that the waiver does not result in adverse impacts to other land and water users.  No waiver may be granted under this subsection if it is prohibited by federal law or if the waiver would jeopardize the continued delegation to the state of authority to implement a federal environmental program.

 

#### Section 49-292. Settlement; authority and effect

A. The director shall consider any offer of settlement by a person who is potentially liable for remedial action costs under this article and CERCLA. The director shall consider the factors in section 49-282.06 and section 49-285, subsections E and F in determining whether to settle any person's liability. In determining the settlement amount, the director shall take into account any past costs incurred for remedial actions at the site by the person. Costs of remedial actions that are incurred by an eligible party as defined in section 49-281, that are or have been approved by the director pursuant to section 49-285, subsection B and that are conducted under the oversight of the director shall be used as a credit against that eligible party's liability. Nothing in this section requires the director to reimburse from the fund the orphan share of costs of approved remedial actions incurred by an eligible party before June 30, 1997. The director may enter into a settlement agreement or consent decree with a potentially responsible party or with a prospective purchaser pursuant to section 49-285.01 without making an express finding in the settlement agreement or consent decree regarding an imminent and substantial endangerment to the public health or welfare, the waters of this state or the environment.

B. In any settlement agreement or consent decree entered into pursuant to subsection A of this section, the director may provide any potentially responsible party with a covenant not to sue concerning any liability to the state under this article or under CERCLA including future liability that may result from a release or threat of a release of a hazardous substance addressed by a remedial action whether that action is on site or off site. A covenant not to sue takes effect when the settlement agreement or consent decree becomes final. A covenant not to sue with respect to future liability shall include an exception that allows the director to sue the responsible party concerning future liability from the release or threatened release that is the subject of the covenant if the liability arises out of conditions that are unknown to the director at the time the director enters into the covenant. A covenant not to sue does not preclude the director from suing the potentially responsible party for failure to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement or consent decree in which the covenant was included.

C. A potentially responsible party who has resolved its liability to the state that arises from this article or from CERCLA in a judicially approved consent decree is not liable for claims for contribution or cost recovery regarding matters addressed in the consent decree. Any such judicially approved consent decree does not discharge other potentially responsible parties unless its terms so provide, but such a settlement does reduce the potential liability of other potentially responsible parties by the amount of the settlement.  If a potentially responsible party receives an allocation pursuant to section 49-287.06 or 49-287.07 that is less than the amount the potentially responsible party agreed to pay the state pursuant to a settlement agreement or consent decree, the excess amount paid by the potentially responsible party shall be credited to the fund.  Any payment by a potentially responsible party in excess of the allocation shall not reduce the proportionate liability of any other potentially responsible party.

D. If the state has obtained less than complete relief from a potentially responsible party who has resolved its liability to the state, the state may bring an action against any other potentially responsible party pursuant to section 49-287.07 who has not so resolved its liability.

E. A potentially responsible party who has resolved its liability to the state may seek contribution for matters addressed in the settlement from any person who is not a party to a settlement entered into under this section.

F. In any action under this section, the rights of any potentially responsible party who has resolved its liability to the state in a judicially approved consent decree or a settlement agreement are subordinate to the rights of the state for matters addressed in the settlement agreement or consent decree, unless otherwise provided in the settlement agreement or consent decree. If a potentially responsible party who has resolved its liability to the state in a settlement agreement or a consent decree provides written notice to the department that it has initiated a lawsuit to recover some or all of its remedial action costs from other potentially responsible parties, the department within thirty days shall provide written notice to the party filing the lawsuit of the department's intent to assert any superior claims the department may have against the other potentially responsible parties. If practicable, the written notice shall include the anticipated dollar amount of the department's claims against each party.

G. The court shall not approve a consent decree entered into pursuant to this section for a period of thirty days after the date that notice of the terms of the consent decree is provided to the public to allow for public comment. Any comment shall be filed with the court and a copy shall be sent by mail to the director and to the settling party. After the expiration of the thirty day public comment period, the director through the attorney general may petition the court for entry of the consent order.

H. A person's decision to enter into a settlement agreement pursuant to this article shall not be construed as an admission in any other judicial proceeding as to the fact or extent of that person's liability with respect to the releases or threatened releases that are covered by the settlement.

#### Section 49-292.01. Qualified business settlements; definition

A. The director shall enter into a settlement under this article and section 107 of CERCLA with a person that qualifies pursuant to this section without regard to the extent of its liability except for a person whose liability under this article arose from criminal acts.

B. An applicant seeking settlement under this section shall have identifiable gross income as defined in section 61 of the internal revenue code greater than one dollar in each of the two years prior to the application and in each of the two years preceding the year that an investigation of the applicant's share was initiated by either the department or the United States environmental protection agency. The applicant shall submit a letter to the director requesting a qualified business settlement on a form provided by the director. The request letter shall include the applicant's tax returns for the time periods provided in subsection J of this section. The director may require additional information to verify the applicant's eligibility for a settlement under this section. Financial information submitted by the applicant pursuant to this section and marked "confidential" shall be kept confidential by the director.

C. If the director verifies that the applicant meets the definition of a qualified business, the director shall enter into a settlement within ninety days after receipt of the request letter and other information required under this section. The settlement shall meet the requirements of section 49-292, but without regard to the extent of its liability, and shall require that:

1. The qualified business pay ten per cent of its average annual gross income for the two years preceding the year that a request was submitted by the applicant including the income from money or assets transferred by the applicant within the two years preceding the application. The director shall allow the settlement amount to be paid over time, up to a maximum of ten years, subject to payment of interest at the rate of six per cent per year. If the settlement amount is paid in full within the first five years, the payments shall not be subject to the payment of interest. An applicant may file a petition with the director to modify the payment schedule.

2. The qualified business cooperate with the director in providing reasonable access and information necessary for the director to carry out the requirements of this article.

D. Notice of the settlement shall be published as provided in section 49-292. The notice shall provide a general description of the contents of the agreement. Any interested person may comment on whether the applicant is a qualified business in writing to the director. The director may withdraw from a settlement after considering the comments.

E. If the director determines that the business does not qualify for the qualified business settlement pursuant to this section, the director shall notify the applicant in writing within ninety days of the receipt of all information required under subsection B of this section stating the reasons for denial. If the director does not notify the applicant within ninety days, the application is deemed denied. A denial of a settlement under this section may be appealed to the office of administrative hearings pursuant to section 49-298. In any appeal made pursuant to section 49-298, the documents submitted by the applicant under subsection B of this section are not confidential.

F. In reviewing a proposed settlement, the United States district court or superior court shall give deference to the department's determination that the settlement is in the public interest and meets applicable legal standards for court approval. Any person who challenges a proposed settlement bears the burden of proving that the proposed settlement does not meet applicable legal standards for court approval. If a settlement is reached with an applicant, the confidential information supplied to the director under this section may be submitted under seal to the court for in camera review.

G. In determining the applicant's gross income for purposes of determining eligibility pursuant to subsection J of this section, the income of all concerns in which the applicant maintains ownership, control or management may be considered by the director. Any transfer of money or assets by the applicant within the two years preceding the application shall be presumed void for purposes of determining eligibility under this section. This presumption may be rebutted by the applicant if the applicant submits a written presumption rebuttal statement that includes the reasons why the transfer of money or assets within this time period should not be presumed void for purposes of determining eligibility. The department shall consider this statement and provide a written record of decision to the applicant that either affirms or denies the applicant's reasons provided in the presumption rebuttal statement.

H. The director may adopt rules to implement this section. A settlement under this section applies only to the applicant and does not release or affect in any way the liability of any other person.

I. If a settlement is made pursuant to this section, the director shall not file a lien pursuant to section 49-295 for an amount greater than the settlement.

J. For the purposes of this section, "qualified business" means an applicant who meets both of the following conditions:

1. The applicant's gross income as defined by section 61 of the internal revenue service code is less than two million dollars per year and greater than one dollar per year.

2. The applicant complies with the definition for the average of the two years preceding the year that an investigation of the applicant's share was initiated by either the department or the United States environmental protection agency, and for each of the two years preceding the year that a request was submitted by the applicant pursuant to subsection B of this section.

If a person does not qualify as a qualified business under this section, the person is eligible to settle its liability under this article and section 107 of CERCLA for less than its proportionate share under section 49-285 on a demonstration of financial hardship under section 49-292.02.

#### Section 49-292.02. Financial hardship settlement

A. The director shall consider any offer by a person who may be potentially liable for remedial action costs under this article or section 107(a) of CERCLA without regard to the extent of that person's liability. In order to obtain a settlement under this section, a person must demonstrate a financial hardship with respect to payment of a potential liability under this article or under CERCLA. A person whose liability under this article arose or could arise from criminal acts is not eligible to request a settlement under this section. In considering a person's ability to pay, the director shall consider all of the following:

1. The financial resources of the person, including available insurance.

2. The person's ability to continue in business after payment of a settlement amount.

3. Whether liability for the settlement amount would require the person to seek protection under federal bankruptcy law.

B. An applicant seeking settlement under this section shall submit a letter to the director requesting a financial hardship settlement on a form provided by the director. The request letter shall include the applicant's tax returns and all schedules, financial statements, balance statements and other information concerning the person's gross income and net worth for the five years preceding the date of the application on a form provided by the director. Within ninety days of the application, the director may require additional information to verify the applicant's eligibility for settlement under this section. The applicant may provide any additional information the applicant believes to be relevant. Financial information submitted by the applicant pursuant to this section and marked "confidential" shall be kept confidential by the director. If the director or the attorney general disputes a claim of confidentiality, written notice shall be provided to the person claiming the confidentiality that the claim is disputed. If the person claiming the confidentiality does not file an action for declaratory relief in superior court within thirty days after receiving this notice, the information shall be made available to the public. An applicant who submits false or intentionally misleading information is not eligible for a settlement pursuant to this section.

C. If the director verifies that the applicant has demonstrated a financial hardship with respect to payment of a potential liability under this article or CERCLA, the director shall enter into a settlement within ninety days after receipt of the request letter and other information required under this section. The settlement shall meet the requirements of section 49-292, but without regard to the extent of the person's liability, and shall be made pursuant to subsection A of this section. The director shall allow the settlement amount to be paid over time, up to a maximum of ten years, subject to payment of interest at the rate of six per cent per year. If the settlement amount is paid in full within the first five years, the payments shall not be subject to the payment of interest. An applicant may file a petition with the director to modify the payment schedule.

D. The applicant shall cooperate with the director in providing reasonable access and information necessary for the director to carry out the requirements of this article.

E. Notice of the settlement shall be published as provided in section 49-292. The notice shall provide a general description of the contents of the agreement. Any interested person may comment on whether the applicant qualifies for a settlement pursuant to this section in writing to the director. The director may withdraw from a settlement after considering the comments.

F. If the director determines that the applicant does not qualify for a settlement pursuant to this section, the director shall notify the applicant in writing within ninety days of the receipt of all information required under subsection B of this section stating the reasons. If the director does not notify the applicant within ninety days, the application is deemed denied. A denial of settlement under this section may be appealed to the office of administrative hearings pursuant to section 49-298. In any appeal made pursuant to section 49-298, the documents submitted by the applicant under subsection B of this section are not confidential. The appeal shall determine only the amount the applicant is able to pay.

G. In reviewing a proposed settlement, the federal district court or superior court shall give deference to the director's determination that the settlement is in the public interest and meets applicable legal standards for court approval. Any person challenging a proposed settlement shall bear the burden of proving that the proposed settlement does not meet the applicable legal standards for court approval. If a settlement is reached with an applicant, the confidential information supplied to the director under this section may be submitted under seal to the court for in camera review.

H. In determining the applicant's financial resources, the financial resources of all concerns in which the applicant maintains ownership, control or management may be considered by the director. A settlement under this section applies only to the applicant and does not release, affect or increase the liability of any other person. The director may adopt rules to implement this section.

I. If a settlement is made pursuant to this section, the director shall not file a lien pursuant to section 49-295 for an amount greater than the settlement.

J. Within thirty days after the director has proposed an allocation share under section 49-287.05 or a share has been allocated under section 49-287.06 to a person who has previously settled with the department pursuant to this section, the director may request that the previous settlement be reopened to determine whether the person who has settled can pay an amount that is greater than the previous settlement amount but not more than the allocated share. A decision by the director to initiate a review of the previous settlement shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation twice within a one week period. The notice shall provide a general description of the director's reasons for initiating a review of the previous settlement. Any interested person may comment in writing to the director on whether the settlement should be reopened and whether the person who previously settled with the department pursuant to this section should be required to pay a different amount from the previous settlement amount. Public comments must be received by the director within thirty days of the last date of publication. The person who settled shall submit updated versions of the documents prescribed by subsection B of this section to provide financial information since the previous settlement. Within ninety days after receipt of the information prescribed by this subsection, the director shall notify the person whether the original settlement amount will be revised. If the director determines that the original settlement amount will be revised, the director shall provide the person with the revised settlement amount and the basis for that revision. Any monies paid pursuant to the original settlement shall be credited toward any revised settlement amount. If the director does not notify the person who settled within ninety days, the original settlement amount is not subject to revision. Within thirty days after the director's decision to revise the original settlement amount, the director must petition the court having jurisdiction over the settlement. The court shall determine whether the settlement amount shall be reopened and what the settlement amount shall be, but it shall not be more than the allocated share.

#### Section 49-294. Use of monies obtained through consent decrees or litigation

A. All monies obtained by the director as the result of a settlement entered into pursuant to this article or through filing an action in state or federal court under this article or under CERCLA shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147. Monies recovered pursuant to this section for the department's remedial action costs that are incurred before the date of a settlement or a court judgment shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the water quality assurance revolving fund. Monies recovered pursuant to this section for the department's remedial action costs that are to be incurred after the date of a settlement or court judgment may be deposited in separate accounts, and any interest earned on monies in these accounts shall be credited to those accounts for use for remedial action at the specific site or facility from which the monies were generated, including reasonable and necessary costs, and legal costs for administration of the account for that site or facility. If a specific site's or facility's account contains monies at the completion of the remedial action, the director may use these excess monies in the manner and for the purposes prescribed in section 49-282.

B. This section and sections 49-292, 49-295 and 49-296 shall not be construed to limit the authority of the director to take any action under federal law or under other provisions of this title.

 

#### Section 49-295. Environmental liens

A. In addition to other rights or remedies available to this state, and in order to protect the state's interest in recovering monies expended by the state for remedial action, all remedial action costs for which a person is liable to the state for the remedial actions conducted at that facility by the state under this article constitute a lien in favor of the state against only the property that is a facility subject to or affected by that remedial action and in which the person who is liable has an ownership interest.

B. The director may request the attorney general to file an action in the superior court in the county in which the property is located for an order establishing an environmental lien. The application for an environmental lien may be filed and recorded pursuant to subsection H of this section. The application for an environmental lien shall include the following information:

1. The name of the record owner of the real property on which the environmental lien is requested, the name of the person purportedly liable, if different, and the person's ownership interest.

2. The legal description of the real property where the environmental lien attaches.

3. The amount and an itemization of remedial action costs that have been incurred by this state as of the time the application is filed.

4. A statement of the evidence demonstrating that the person is liable for remedial action costs incurred by the state under this article.

C. On the filing of an application for an environmental lien, the court shall set a hearing date at least thirty but not more than forty-five days from the date the application is filed with the court. The hearing may be rescheduled if all parties agree to a different date. Service of the application and notice of the hearing date on the purportedly liable person and the record owner of the subject real property, if different, shall be in the manner prescribed in the Arizona rules of civil procedure.

D. On a showing by the state of probable cause that the person is liable for remedial action costs incurred by the state under this article and the amount of the remedial action costs and that the person has an ownership interest in the real property that is the subject of the application for an environmental lien, the court may issue an order establishing an environmental lien in favor of the state.

E. The order establishing an environmental lien shall be filed and recorded as provided in subsection H of this section. If the state records the application for an environmental lien as provided in subsection H of this section, the environmental lien shall be deemed to attach as of the date of recording of the application for the environmental lien, once the order establishing the environmental lien is filed and recorded. If the state does not record the application for the environmental lien, the environmental lien attaches only on the recording of the order establishing the lien as provided in subsection H of this section.

F. If after establishment of an environmental lien the state incurs additional remedial action costs for which the person is liable under this article, the state may seek to amend the existing lien to include in the amount of the lien the additional remedial action costs incurred. The state shall file a statement itemizing the costs incurred with the court, with service as prescribed in subsection C of this section. On a showing by the state of probable cause with respect to the amount of those additional remedial action costs, the court may increase the amount of the environmental lien by the amount of those additional remedial action costs.

G. Any person that has been determined liable for remedial action costs in a probable cause hearing for purposes of establishing a lien and that owns an interest in real property that is the subject of an environmental lien established under this section shall notify the state in writing at least sixty days before alienating the interest. If the state believes that it will incur future remedial action costs at the facility, the state may within thirty days of receipt of the notification request a probable cause hearing pursuant to subsection C of this section. The court shall schedule the requested hearing before expiration of the sixty day period beginning on the date the state received notice that the person intends to alienate its interest, unless the parties agree to a continuance. Unless the person giving notice to the state withdraws that notice before the scheduled date of the hearing, the court shall conduct a hearing to estimate the state's future remedial action costs and may issue an order amending the lien to include total future remedial action costs that the state appears reasonably likely to incur. Any order increasing the amount of an existing lien pursuant to this subsection may be filed and recorded as provided in subsection H of this section. Any person having an ownership interest in the property that may be adversely affected by the order increasing the environmental lien may challenge the increased lien amount by filing a motion to quash pursuant to subsection I of this section. If the state fails to request a probable cause hearing with respect to estimated future remedial action costs within thirty days of receipt of the notification, any person subsequently purchasing an interest in real property that is subject to an environmental lien takes that interest subject only to existing, unsatisfied liens, and that person is liable to the state for future remedial action costs only to the extent it is liable for those costs because it is a responsible party under section 49-283 or because it is otherwise liable under other federal, state or common law.

H. Any application, order, lien, release or other document required to be recorded under this section shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county where the real property is located. A filing fee or other charge is not required for filing any document pursuant to this section. The filing or mailing of any document pursuant to this section is the responsibility of the director or the director's designee. A copy of an environmental lien shall also be sent by certified mail to any other person including an owner, purchaser, holder of a mortgage or security interest or judgment lien creditor whose interest was perfected and recorded before an application for an environmental lien was recorded.

I. If a court issues an order establishing an environmental lien, any person having an interest in the real property that may be adversely affected by establishment of the lien may file a motion to quash the lien. The court retains jurisdiction to resolve any issue of fact or law raised by the motion to quash. If the motion to quash raises issues of fact, the person challenging the lien and the state are entitled to conduct expedited discovery on application to the court and are entitled to a priority for trial.

J. At any time after the lien is recorded any person having an ownership interest in real property subject to an environmental lien may move the court to substitute other security for the lien. The court shall retain jurisdiction to determine the sufficiency of the substituted security. On approval of the substituted security, the environmental lien shall be released.

K. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, an environmental lien does not apply to real property that is used primarily for or that is under construction for use in single or multi-family housing at the time the environmental lien is recorded.

L. The director shall release an environmental lien if the lien or a claim or judgement for the remedial action costs is satisfied. If the lien or a claim or judgement for the remedial action costs has been partially but not wholly satisfied, the director on request of any person having an ownership interest in the property shall reduce the amount of the lien by the amount satisfied. The director may release an environmental lien if the director determines that the lien is not in the best interest of the state.

M. If the court refuses to issue an order establishing an environmental lien, any person having an interest in the property against which an environmental lien was sought is not entitled to attorney fees or damages against the state if the court determines that there was reasonable cause for the application.

N. Any determination of any issue by the court in a hearing held pursuant to this section shall not be considered binding in any future judicial or administrative proceeding except that any issue litigated in a motion to quash filed pursuant to this section shall not be litigated again in any subsequent motion to quash filed pursuant to this section that is filed by the same party.

O. An environmental lien is subject to any other lien that is perfected and recorded before the attachment date of the environmental lien as determined pursuant to subsection E of this section.

P. On entry of a final judgment in favor of the state for remedial action costs, an environmental lien may be foreclosed in the manner provided for foreclosure of mortgages pursuant to title 33, chapter 6, article 2. The state may combine an action to recover remedial action costs with an action to foreclose an environmental lien established under this section.

Q. This section does not preclude the state from initiating other actions under this title or under federal law.

#### Section 49-296. Settlement agreements

A settlement agreement made pursuant to this article may provide that the director shall reimburse a party to the agreement from the fund for the costs of specific remedial actions that the party has agreed to perform. In appropriate cases, the director may make reasonable efforts pursuant to this article to recover any fund expenditures from responsible parties who are not involved in the settlement agreement. A decision by the director not to reimburse a party from the fund for the costs of conducting a remedial action that is contained in a settlement agreement is not subject to judicial review.

#### Section 49-298. Appealable agency actions; licenses

A. Nothing in this article is an appealable agency action as defined in section 41-1092 or a contested case as defined in section 41-1001 except for the following:

1. A determination by the director that a person does not qualify for a settlement pursuant to section 49-292.01 or 49-292.02.

2. A no further action determination pursuant to section 49-287.01, subsection H.

B. An appeal shall be initiated by filing a notice of appeal with the director pursuant to section 41-1092.03, subsection B.

C. Nothing in this article constitutes a license as defined in section 41-1001.

(b) Has reasonable cause to believe a violation of this chapter, rules adopted pursuant to this chapter or a permit issued pursuant to this chapter has been committed.

(c) Determines that those studies or data are necessary to accomplish the purposes of this chapter, and that the monitoring, sampling or other studies by the source are necessary in order to assess the impact of the source on the emission of air contaminants.

B. The director shall adopt rules requiring sources of air contaminants to monitor, sample or otherwise quantify their emissions of air pollution that may reasonably be attributable to such sources for air contaminants for which ambient air quality standards or emission standards or design, equipment, work practice or operational standards have been adopted pursuant to section 49-424 or section 49-425, subsection A. In the development of the rules, the director shall consider the cost and effectiveness of the monitoring, sampling or other studies.

C. For those sources of air contaminants for which rules are not required to be adopted pursuant to subsection B of this section, the director may require a source of air contaminants, by permit or order, to perform monitoring, sampling or other quantification of its emissions or air pollution that may reasonably be attributed to such a source.  Before requiring such monitoring, sampling or other quantification by permit or order, the director shall consider the relative cost and accuracy of any alternatives that may be reasonable under the circumstances such as emission factors, modeling, mass balance analyses or emissions projections.  The director may require such monitoring, sampling or other quantification by permit or order if the director determines in writing that all of the following conditions are met:

1. The actual or potential emissions or air pollution may adversely affect public health or the environment.

2. A monitoring, sampling or quantification method is technically feasible for the subject contaminant and the source.

3. An adequate scientific basis for the monitoring, sampling or quantification method exists.

4. The monitoring, sampling or quantification method is reasonably accurate.

5. The cost of the method is reasonable in light of the use to be made of the data.

D. In determining the frequency and duration of monitoring, sampling or quantification of emissions under subsections B and C of this section, the director shall consider the five factors prescribed in subsection C of this section and the level of emissions from the source.

E. Orders issued and permit conditions imposed pursuant to this section may be appealed as appealable agency actions pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

F. On request of the on-scene commander or the department of health services, the department of environmental quality shall assist at a significant chemical or other toxic fire event, excluding chemical or nuclear warfare or biological agents, and shall provide the following services if funding is available and if the director, in the director's professional capacity, determines the department's provision of services is necessary to protect human health and the environment:

1. Collect air samples for likely contaminants resulting from the fire. The department of environmental quality shall coordinate sampling locations, times and pollutants to be sampled with the department of health services and other appropriate health and emergency response officials.

2. Maintain an hourly plume report that includes meteorological conditions that affect dispersal of smoke.

3. In consultation with the department of health services and the on-scene coordinator, prepare a report that includes test results of any sampling, including the sampling rationale and protocol and chain of custody report using applicable environmental protection agency standards.  The report shall also include, to the extent practicable, a smoke dispersion map with detail adequate to determine possible areas of impact at the level of detail practicable and a listing of likely releases of any chemical that is categorized by the United States environmental protection agency as a hazardous air pollutant and the corresponding environmental protection agency description of possible health effects of the chemical based on a reliable inventory of hazardous materials at the site or facility.

 

#### Section 49-424. Duties of department

The department shall:

1. Determine whether the meteorology of the state is such that airsheds can be reasonably identified and air pollution, therefore, can be controlled by establishing air pollution control districts within well defined geographical areas.

2. Make continuing determinations of the quantity and nature of emissions of air contaminants, topography, wind and temperature conditions, possible chemical reactions in the atmosphere, the character of development of the various areas of the state, the economic effect of remedial measures on the various areas of the state, the availability, use and economic feasibility of air-cleaning devices, the effect on human health and danger to property from air contaminants, the effect on industrial operations of remedial measures and other matters necessary to arrive at a better understanding of air pollution and its control.

D. All rules enacted pursuant to this section shall be made available to the public at a reasonable charge on request.

#### Section 49-426. Permits; duties of director; exceptions; applications; objections; fees

A. A permit shall:

1. Be issued by the director in compliance with the terms of this section.

2. Be required for any person seeking a compliance extension pursuant to section 49-426.03, subsection B, paragraph 3 and section 112(a)(5) of the clean air act and for any person beginning actual construction of or operating any source, except as prescribed in subsection B of this section or section 49-426.01.

B. The provisions of this section shall not apply to motor vehicles, to agricultural vehicles or agricultural equipment used in normal farm operations, or to fuel burning equipment which, at a location or property other than a one or two family residence, is rated at less than one million British thermal units per hour. The director may establish by rule additional sources or classifications of sources for which a permit is not required and pollutant-emitting activities and emissions units at permitted sources that are not required to be included in the permit. The director shall not adopt such rules unless the director makes a written finding with supporting facts that the exempted source, class of sources, pollutant-emitting activities or emissions units will have an insignificant adverse impact on air quality. In adopting these rules, the director may consider any rule that is adopted by the administrator pursuant to section 502 of the clean air act and that exempts one or more source categories from the requirement to obtain a permit under title V of the clean air act.

C. Every application for a permit shall be filed in the manner and form prescribed by the director, and shall contain all the information necessary to enable the director to make the determination to grant or deny such application. The director shall establish by rule requirements for permit applications, including the standard application form for title V sources. The director shall establish by rule requirements for applications for general permits. An application for a permit issued pursuant to title V of the clean air act shall include a compliance plan that describes how the applicant will comply with all of the applicable requirements of this chapter and the clean air act, including a schedule of compliance and a schedule under which progress reports will be submitted to the director at least every six months. The director may require that such application include all sources that are used or to be used by the applicant in a certain process or a single facility or location. Before acting on an application for a permit, the director may require the applicant to furnish further information or further plans or specifications. The director shall act, within a reasonable time, on such application and shall notify the applicant in writing of the proposed approval or denial of such application, except that the director may have a reasonable period of time in which to gather information, inspect premises, and issue such permits. The director shall adopt rules that establish procedures for determining when applications are complete, for processing applications and for reviewing permit actions. The director shall also establish by rule criteria for determining reasonable times for processing permit applications. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection for permits issued pursuant to title V of the clean air act shall conform to the requirements of section 505(a) of the clean air act.

D. The director shall give notice of a proposed permit for a source required to obtain a permit pursuant to title V of the clean air act once each week for two consecutive weeks in two newspapers of general circulation in the county in which the source is or will be located. The notice shall describe the proposed permit and air contaminants to be emitted and shall state that any person may submit comments on the proposed permit and may request a public hearing. The director shall require the applicant at the time of the first notice to post the site where the source is or may be located. If permitted by federal, state and local law, the posting shall be prominently placed at a site that is under the applicant's legal control and that is adjacent to the nearest public roadway. The posting shall be visible to the public using the public roadway and shall contain the information in the notice that is published by the director. If a public hearing is requested, the director shall require the applicant to place an additional posting that provides notice of the public hearing. A posting shall be maintained until the public comment period on the proposed permit is closed. The director shall make available to the public notices of proposed permits. Each public notice that is issued under this chapter shall be mailed to the permit applicant, to the affected federal, state and local agencies and to those persons who have requested in writing copies of proposed permit action notices.

A written comment shall state the name and mailing address of the person, shall be signed by the person, his agent or his attorney and shall clearly set forth reasons why the permit should or should not be issued. Grounds for comment are limited to whether the proposed permit meets the criteria for issuance prescribed in this section or in section 49-427. The department shall consider and prepare written responses to all comments received during the public comment period including comments made at a public hearing conducted by the department. At the time a final permit decision is made, copies of the department's responses shall be made available to the applicant and any person who commented on the proposed permit.

E. Permits or revisions issued pursuant to this section or section 49-426.01 may be issued subject to such terms and conditions as are consistent with the requirements of this article, article 1 of this chapter and the clean air act and are found by the director to be necessary, following public notice and an opportunity for a public hearing as provided in subsection D or H of this section or in section 49-426.01, and subject to payment of a reasonable fee to be determined as follows:

1. For a source that is required to obtain a permit pursuant to title V of the clean air act, the director shall establish by rule a system of fees that is consistent with and equivalent to that prescribed by section 502 of the clean air act. These rules shall prescribe procedures for increasing the fee each year by the percentage if any by which the consumer price index for the immediately preceding calendar year exceeds the consumer price index for calendar year 1989.

2. For a facility that is required to obtain a permit pursuant to this chapter but that is not required to obtain a permit pursuant to title V of the clean air act, the director shall determine a fee based on the total actual cost of processing the permit application, but not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars.

The director shall establish an annual inspection fee, not to exceed the average cost of inspection. The director shall adopt, by rule, criteria for determining fees and for public hearings.

F. Permits issued pursuant to this section shall be issued for a period of five years.

G. Except as provided in subsection H of this section, any person burning used oil, used oil fuel, hazardous waste or hazardous waste fuel in any machine, incinerator or device shall first obtain a permit from the director.

7. The director by rule shall adopt procedures for the issuance of general permits.

8. The director may adopt conditions in a general permit applicable to sources located in a specified geographic area either independently of or upon petition by a county air pollution control officer.

I. Permits issued pursuant to this section for a source required to obtain a permit under title V of the clean air act shall contain all of the following:

1. Conditions reflecting all applicable requirements of this article and rules adopted pursuant to this article.

2. Enforceable emission limitations and standards.

3. A schedule for compliance, if applicable.

4. The requirement to submit at least every six months the results of any required monitoring.

5. Any other conditions that are necessary to assure compliance with this article and the clean air act, including the applicable implementation plan.

J. The director may refuse to issue any permit to any source subject to the requirements of title V of the clean air act if the administrator objects to its issuance in a timely manner as prescribed under title V of the act.

K. If an applicant has submitted a timely and complete application for a permit required under this section, but final action has not been taken on that application, failure to obtain a permit shall not be a violation of this chapter unless the delay in final action is due to the failure of the applicant to submit information required or requested to process the application. This subsection does not apply to any person required to obtain a permit before commencing construction of a source as required under this section or any person seeking a permit revision as provided under section 49-426.01.

L. The director may issue a single permit authorizing emissions from similar operations at multiple temporary locations, if the permit includes conditions that will assure compliance with all applicable requirements of this chapter and the clean air act at all locations.  Any permit issued pursuant to this subsection shall require the applicant to notify the director in advance of each change in location. In issuing a single permit, the director may require a separate permit fee for operations at each location.

M. In the case of a permit with a term of three or more years issued pursuant to the requirements of title V of the clean air act to a major source, the director shall require revisions to the permit to incorporate applicable standards and regulations adopted by the administrator pursuant to the clean air act after the issuance of the permit. The director shall require any revisions as expeditiously as practicable, but not later than eighteen months after the promulgation of such standards and regulations. No permit revision shall be required if the effective date of standards and regulations is after the expiration of the permit. Any permit revision required pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as a permit renewal.

N. Any permit issued pursuant to the requirements of this article and title V of the clean air act to a unit subject to the provisions of title IV of the clean air act shall include conditions prohibiting all of the following:

1. Annual emissions of sulfur dioxide in excess of the number of allowances to emit sulfur dioxide held by the owners or operators of the unit or by the designated representative of the owners or operators.

2. Amounts in excess of applicable emission rates.

3. The use of any allowance prior to the year for which it was allocated.

4. Contravention of any other provision of the permit.

O. The director shall adopt a rule specifying the notice, public participation requirements and other permit issuance procedures for permits that are not issued pursuant to title V of the clean air act.

P. In determining whether a permitting threshold established pursuant to this section applies to an existing source, the director shall exclude particulate matter that is not subject to a national ambient air quality standard under the clean air act.

#### Section 49-426.01. Permits; changes within a source; revisions

A. The director shall establish by rule provisions to allow changes within a source required to obtain a permit under title V of the clean air act without requiring a permit revision if all of the following conditions are met:

1. The changes do not constitute modifications under title I of the clean air act.

2. The changes do not result in an emission that is greater than the emissions allowed under the permit.

3. The source provides the director with a written notice of the proposed changes at least seven days in advance of the beginning of those changes.

4. The source satisfies other conditions that may be established in the rules adopted pursuant to this section for title V sources. Rules adopted pursuant to this section at a minimum shall conform to those adopted by the administrator pursuant to title V of the clean air act and may prescribe a different time limit for notifications associated with emergency conditions.

B. A permit issued pursuant to section 49-426 may be revised, revoked and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request for a permit revision, revocation and reissuance, or termination or a notification filed pursuant to subsection A of this section does not stay an effective permit condition. The director may require that the applicant provide in writing within a reasonable time any information that the director identifies as necessary for the director to determine if cause exists for revising, revoking and reissuing, or terminating the permit or for determining compliance with permit conditions.

C. The director shall establish by rule procedures related to public and departmental review of changes to a permitted source. For title V sources, these rules at a minimum shall conform to those adopted by the administrator pursuant to title V of the clean air act. For changes to sources that are not required to obtain a permit under title V of the clean air act, the necessity for and level of public and departmental review of a change shall be determined as prescribed by this chapter and the environmental significance of the change.

#### Section 49-426.02. Permit shield

The director shall establish by rule conditions under which compliance with a permit or permit revision issued pursuant to this chapter constitutes compliance with the applicable requirements of this chapter and the clean air act.

#### Section 49-426.03. Enforcement of federal hazardous air pollutant program; definitions

A. The list of hazardous air pollutants in section 112(b)(1) of the clean air act is adopted as the list of federally listed hazardous air pollutants that will be subject to the program adopted pursuant to subsection B of this section. Within one year after the administrator adds or deletes a pollutant pursuant to section 112(b)(2) or (3) of the clean air act the director shall adopt those revisions for the list adopted pursuant to this subsection unless the director finds that there is no scientific evidence to support the revision.

B. The director shall adopt by rule a program for administration and enforcement of the federal hazardous air pollutant program established by section 112 of the clean air act. The program shall be consistent with and meet the requirements of section 112 of the clean air act and shall contain the following provisions:

1. After the date specified by the administrator in rules adopted pursuant to section 112 (g)(1)(B) of the clean air act, no person may obtain a permit or permit revision to modify a major source of federally listed hazardous air pollutants or to construct a new major source of federally listed hazardous air pollutants, unless the director determines that the person will install the maximum achievable control technology for the modification or new major source. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms "major source" and "modification" have the meanings set forth in section 112(a) of the clean air act and implementing regulations adopted by the administrator. A new or modified major source of federally listed hazardous air pollutants means a major source that commences construction or a modification after rules adopted by the director pursuant to this subsection become effective pursuant to section 41-1032. A physical change to a source or change in the method of operation of a source is not a modification subject to this paragraph or paragraph 2 of this subsection if the change complies with section 112(g)(1) of the clean air act.

2. After the date specified by the administrator in rules adopted pursuant to section 112 (g)(1)(B) of the clean air act and until the administrator adopts emissions standards establishing the maximum achievable control technology for a source category or subcategory that includes a source subject to paragraph 1 of this subsection, the director shall determine the maximum achievable control technology for the modification of new major source on a case-by-case basis. If the director determines that it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard, a maximum achievable control technology standard imposed pursuant to this paragraph may consist of a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, or a combination thereof.

3. If an existing source submits an application pursuant to section 49-426 which demonstrates that the source has achieved a reduction of ninety per cent or more of federally listed hazardous air pollutants or ninety-five per cent in the case of federally listed hazardous air pollutants that are particulates, the director shall issue a permit or permit revision allowing the source to meet an alternative emission limitation reflecting such reduction in lieu of an emission limitation promulgated by the administrator under section 112(d) of the clean air act. The application shall comply with section 112(i)(5) of the clean air act and implementing regulations adopted by the administrator. The alternative emission limitation shall apply for a period of six years from the compliance date otherwise applicable to the source under section 112(d) of the clean air act.

4. If the administrator fails to adopt a standard for a source category or subcategory within eighteen months after the deadline established for that category or subcategory pursuant to section 112(e)(1) and (3) of the clean air act, the owner or operator of an existing major source in the category or subcategory shall be required to submit a permit application for such source pursuant to section 49-426, and the director, acting in accordance with the procedures adopted pursuant to section 49-426, shall be required to issue a permit establishing maximum achievable control technology for the affected source on a case-by-case basis or, in the alternative, an alternative emission limitation pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection. If the director determines that it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard, a maximum achievable control technology standard imposed pursuant to this paragraph may consist of a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, or a combination thereof.

5. When the administrator adopts and makes effective standards pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(f) of the clean air act the director shall adopt those standards in the same manner as prescribed by the administrator.

6. When a reliable method of measuring emissions of a hazardous air pollutant subject to this section is not available, the director shall not require compliance with a numeric emission limit for that pollutant but shall instead require compliance with a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, or a combination of those standards. The provision adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall not apply to sources or modifications that commence construction after the permit program established pursuant to section 49-426 becomes effective under section 502(h) of the clean air act.

C. Where the clean air act has established provisions, including specific schedules, for the regulation of source categories pursuant to section 112(e)(5) and 112(n) of the clean air act, those provisions and schedules shall be adopted by the director and shall apply to the regulation of those source categories under subsection B of this section.

D. For any category or subcategory of facilities licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission, the director shall not adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting emissions of radionuclides which is more stringent than the standard or limitation adopted by the administrator pursuant to section 112 of the clean air act.

E. When the administrator makes one of the following findings pursuant to section 112(n)(1)(A) of the clean air act the finding is effective for purposes of the state's administration and enforcement of the federal hazardous air pollutant program in the same manner as prescribed by the administrator:

1. A finding that regulation is not appropriate or necessary.

2. A finding that alternative control strategies should be applied.

#### Section 49-426.04. State list of hazardous air pollutants

A. The state list of hazardous air pollutants that are subject to regulation consists of all of the following:

1. Hazardous air pollutants that are designated by the director by rule if the director finds all of the following:

(a) There is scientifically reliable evidence on the health or environmental effects of the pollutant adequate to support the designation. The director shall rely on technical protocols appropriate for the development of the list of hazardous air pollutants and shall base the designation on credible medical and toxicological evidence that has been subjected to peer review. Evidence shall be considered scientifically reliable only if it demonstrates adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects from an air pollutant at concentrations that are likely to occur in the environment as a result of emissions of the pollutant into the ambient air.

(b) Emissions, ambient concentrations, bioaccumulation or deposition of the pollutant result in adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects.

(c) An adequate and reliable methodology exists for quantifying emissions and ambient concentrations of the pollutant.

2. Federally listed hazardous air pollutants.

B. Except in the case of federally listed hazardous air pollutants, the director may by rule rescind the designation of an air pollutant as a hazardous air pollutant if the director finds that any of the criteria specified in subsection A is not satisfied.

C. Any person may petition the director to designate any air pollutant as a hazardous air pollutant pursuant to subsection A. The director shall within six months of the receipt of such a petition begin the rule making process to designate the pollutant as a hazardous air pollutant pursuant to subsection A, if the petitioner demonstrates or the director finds that all of the criteria specified in subsection A are satisfied.

D. Any person may petition the director to rescind the designation of an air pollutant as a hazardous air pollutant pursuant to subsection B. The director shall within six months of the receipt of such a petition begin the rule making process to rescind the designation of the air pollutant as a hazardous air pollutant pursuant to subsection B, if the petitioner demonstrates or the director finds that any of the criteria specified in subsection A is not satisfied.

E. The director shall not designate a conventional air pollutant as a hazardous air pollutant. This subsection shall not apply to any of the following pollutants:

1. Any pollutant that independently meets the criteria of subsection A and is a precursor to a conventional air pollutant.

2. Any pollutant that is in a class of conventional air pollutants.

#### Section 49-426.05. Designation of sources of hazardous air pollutants

A. The director may by rule designate a category of sources that are subject to the state program for control of hazardous air pollutants established pursuant to section 49-426.06. In order to designate a category of sources pursuant to this section, the director shall find that emissions of hazardous air pollutants from sources in the category individually or in the aggregate result in adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects. In determining whether emissions from a category of sources result in adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects, the director shall consider the following:

1. The number of persons likely to be exposed to emissions from sources in the category.

2. Whether the category should be limited to sources with the potential to emit hazardous air pollutants in amounts exceeding the thresholds set forth in section 49-426.06, subsection A, paragraph 2.

3. Whether based on the criteria set forth in this subsection, the category should be limited to sources located in a particular geographic area. The director shall to the maximum extent practicable define source categories so that they cover only those sources for which the finding required by this subsection has been made.

B. In addition to the other authority provided by this chapter, the director may require persons who own or operate sources in a category that the director reasonably believes may qualify for designation pursuant to subsection A of this section to provide the director with notification of the types and amounts of hazardous air pollutants emitted by those sources. The owner or operator of the source shall provide readily available data regarding emissions from the source but shall not be required to conduct performance tests, sampling or monitoring in order to respond to a request under this subsection. Inaccuracies in any notification provided pursuant to this subsection shall not be violations of this chapter, if the inaccuracies result from good faith efforts to identify hazardous air pollutants emitted by the source or to estimate the amount of hazardous air pollutants emitted by the source.

C. When a new source that is within a category that has not been designated pursuant to subsection A of this section submits an application for a permit pursuant to section 49-426, the director may suspend action on the application pending the designation of the category pursuant to subsection A of this section if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The director makes the finding required by subsection A of this section for the category to which the source belongs.

2. The director provides notice of the director's intent to suspend action on the application to the applicant on or before the date that a completeness determination is due under section 49-426.

3. The applicant does not elect to comply with section 49-426.06, subsection C or D.

D. A decision by the director to suspend action on a permit application pursuant to subsection C of this section is appealable pursuant to section 49-428.

#### Section 49-426.06. State program for control of hazardous air pollutants

A. The director shall by rule establish a state program for the control of hazardous air pollutants that meets the requirements of this section. The program established pursuant to this section shall apply to the following sources:

1. Sources that emit or have the potential to emit with controls ten tons per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or twenty-five tons per year or more of any combination of hazardous air pollutants.

2. Sources that are within a category designated pursuant to section 49-426.05 and that emit or have the potential to emit with controls one ton per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or two and one-half tons per year of any combination of hazardous air pollutants.

B. After rules adopted pursuant to subsection A of this section become effective pursuant to section 41-1032, a person shall not commence the construction or modification of a source that is subject to this section without first obtaining a permit or permit revision that complies with section 49-426 and subsection C or D of this section. For purposes of determining whether a change constitutes a modification, the director shall by rule establish appropriate de minimis amounts for hazardous air pollutants that are not federally listed hazardous air pollutants. In establishing de minimis amounts, the director shall consider any relevant guidelines or criteria promulgated by the administrator. A physical change to a source or change in the method of operation of a source is not a modification subject to this section if the change satisfies any of the following conditions:

1. The change complies with section 112(g)(1) of the clean air act.

2. The change, together with any other changes implemented or planned by the source, qualifies the source for an alternative emission limitation pursuant to section 112(i)(5) of the clean air act.

3. The change is required under a standard imposed pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(f) of the clean air act and the change is implemented after the administrator promulgates the standard.

C. A permit or permit revision issued to a new or modified source that is subject to the state hazardous air pollutant program under subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section shall impose the maximum achievable control technology for the new source or modification, unless the applicant demonstrates pursuant to subsection D of this section that the imposition of maximum achievable control technology is not necessary to avoid adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects. A permit or permit revision issued to a new or modified source that is subject to the state hazardous air pollutant program under subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section shall impose hazardous air pollutant reasonably available control technology for the new source or modification, unless the applicant demonstrates pursuant to subsection D of this section that the imposition of hazardous air pollutant reasonably available control technology is not necessary to avoid adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects. When a reliable method of measuring emissions of a hazardous air pollutant subject to this section is not available, the director shall not require compliance with a numeric emission limit for the pollutant but shall instead require compliance with a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, or a combination thereof. Standards imposed pursuant to this subsection shall apply only to hazardous air pollutants emitted in amounts exceeding the de minimis amounts established by the administrator or by the director pursuant to subsection B of this section. The director shall not impose a standard under this subsection that would require the application of measures that are incompatible with measures required under a standard imposed pursuant to section 49-426.03, subsection B.

D. If the owner or operator of a new source or modification subject to this section establishes that the imposition of maximum achievable control technology or hazardous air pollutant reasonably available control technology is not necessary to avoid adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects by conducting a scientifically sound risk management analysis and submitting the results to the director with the permit application for the new source or modification, the director shall exempt the source from the imposition of such technology. The risk management analysis may take into account the following factors:

1. The estimated actual exposure of persons living in the airshed of the source.

2. Available epidemiological or other health studies.

3. Risks presented by background concentrations of hazardous air pollutants.

4. Uncertainties in risk assessment methodology or other health assessment techniques.

5. Health or environmental consequences from efforts to reduce the risk.

6. The technological and commercial availability of control methods beyond those otherwise required for the source and the cost of such methods.

E. Where maximum achievable control technology or hazardous air pollutant reasonably available control technology has been established in a general permit for a defined class of sources pursuant to subsection C of this section and section 49-426, subsection H, the owner or operator of a source within that class may obtain a variance from the standard by complying with subsection D of this section at the time the source applies to be permitted under the general permit. If the owner or operator makes the demonstration required by subsection D of this section and otherwise qualifies for the general permit, the director shall, in accordance with the procedures established pursuant to section 49-426, approve the application and issue a permit granting a variance from the specific provisions of the general permit relating to the standard. Except as otherwise modified by the variance, the general permit shall govern the source.

F. If the clean air act has established provisions, including specific schedules, for the regulation of source categories pursuant to section 112(e)(5) and 112(n) of the clean air act, those provisions and schedules shall apply to the regulation of those source categories under subsection B of this section.

G. For any category or subcategory of facilities licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission, the director shall not adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting emissions of radionuclides that is more stringent than the standard or limitation adopted by the administrator pursuant to section 112 of the clean air act.

H. For purposes of subsection A of this section, in determining potential to emit, the director shall consider controls that are enforceable under any federal law or regulation, state or local law or rule or that are inherent in the design of the source.

I. In determining whether emissions from a source or modification exceed the thresholds prescribed by subsection A or B of this section, the director shall exclude particulate matter emissions that consist of natural crustal material and are produced either by natural forces, such as wind or erosion, or by anthropogenic activities, such as agricultural operations, excavation, blasting, drilling, handling, storage, earth moving, crushing, grinding or traffic over paved or unpaved roads, or other similar activities. This subsection does not preclude the regulation of emissions of crustal materials as particulate matter pursuant to other sections of this chapter.

#### Section 49-426.07. Imminent and substantial endangerment

Notwithstanding any permit granted pursuant to section 49-426.03 or 49-426.06, the director may seek injunctive relief as provided in section 49-462 on receipt of evidence that a source or combination of sources is presenting an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or the environment.

#### Section 49-427. Grant or denial of applications; revisions

A. The director shall deny a permit or revision if the applicant does not show that every such source is so designed, controlled or equipped with such air pollution control equipment that it may be expected to operate without emitting or without causing to be emitted air contaminants in violation of this article and the rules adopted by the director.

B. Before acting on an application for a permit, the director may require the applicant to provide and maintain such facilities as are necessary for sampling and testing purposes in order to secure information that will disclose the nature, extent, quantity or degree of air contaminants discharged into the atmosphere from the source described in the application. In the event of such a requirement, the director shall notify the applicant in writing of the type and characteristics of such facilities.

C. In acting on an application for a permit renewal, if the director finds that such a source has been constructed not in accordance with any prior permit or revision issued pursuant to section 49-426.01, the director shall require the person to obtain a permit revision or shall deny the application for such permit. The director shall not accept any further application for a source so constructed until the director finds that such source has been reconstructed in accordance with the prior permit or a revision, or until a revision to the permit has been obtained.

D. An applicant's performance of any activities that are excluded from the definition of "begin actual construction" under section 49-401.01, paragraph 7, subdivision (a) or (b) shall be at the applicant's risk and shall not reduce the applicant's obligations under this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.  The director shall evaluate an application for a permit or permit revision and make a decision on the same basis as if the activities allowed under section 49-401.01, paragraph 7, subdivision (a) or (b) had not occurred.

E. After a decision on a permit or revision, the director shall notify the applicant and any person who filed a comment to the permit pursuant to section 49-426 or the revision pursuant to section 49-426.01 in writing of the decision, and if the permit is denied, the reasons for such denial.  Service of this notification may be made in person or by first class mail. The director shall not accept a further application unless the applicant has corrected the reasons for the objections specified by the director as reasons for such denial.

 

#### Section 49-428. Appeals of permit actions

A. Within thirty days after notice is given by the director of approval, denial or revocation of a permit, permit revision or conditional order, the applicant and any person who filed a comment on the permit or permit revision pursuant to section 49-426, subsection D, or on the conditional order pursuant to section 49-438, subsection C, may appeal the decision as an appealable agency action pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

B. Any person having an interest that is or may be adversely affected may commence a civil action in superior court against the director alleging that the director has failed to act in a timely manner as provided in section 49-426, subsection C. No action may be commenced before sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice to the director. The court has jurisdiction to require the director to act without additional delay.

#### Section 49-429. Permit transfers; notice; appeal

A. A permit shall not be transferable, whether by operation of law or otherwise, either from one location to another or from one source to another.

B. Subsection A shall not apply to mobile or portable source which is transferred from one location to another after notification to the department of the transfer.

C. A permit may be transferred from one person to another whether by operation of law or otherwise if the person who holds the permit notifies the director in writing before the transfer. The notice shall be in writing and shall include the name, address, telephone number and statutory agent of the person to whom the permit will be transferred, the effective date of the proposed transfer and other information the director may determine to be necessary by rule. The director shall prescribe procedures for this notice.

D. If the director determines that the transferee is not capable of operating the source in compliance with the requirements of this article, rules adopted under this article and the conditions established in the permit, the transfer shall be denied. In order for the denial to be effective, notice of the director's denial, including the reasons for the denial, shall be issued within ten working days of the director's receipt of the notice of proposed transfer.

E. Denial of a permit transfer may be appealed as an appealable agency action pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

#### Section 49-430. Posting of permit

A person who has been granted an operating permit, shall firmly affix such permit, an approved facsimile of such permit, or other approved identification bearing the permit number upon such machine, equipment, incinerator, device or other article for which the operating permit is issued in such a manner as to be clearly visible and accessible. In the event that such machine equipment, incinerator, device or other article is so constructed or operated that such permit cannot be so placed, the permit shall be mounted so as to be clearly visible in an accessible place within a reasonable distance of such machine, equipment, incinerator, device or other article, or maintained readily available at all times on the operating premises.

#### Section 49-431. Notice by building permit agencies

All agencies that issue building permits shall examine the plans and specifications submitted by an applicant for a building permit to determine if an installation permit will possibly be required under the provisions of section 49-426. If it appears possible that such installation permit will be required, the agency shall give written notice to such applicant to contact the department and shall furnish a copy of such notice to the county air pollution control officer and the department.

#### Section 49-432. Classification and reporting; confidentiality of records

A. The director, by rule, shall classify air contaminant sources according to levels and types of emissions and other characteristics which relate to air pollution, and shall require reporting for any such class or classes. Reports may be required as to physical outlets, processes and fuels used, the nature and duration of emissions and such other information as is relevant to air pollution and deemed necessary by the director.

B. The owner, lessee or operator of a source under the jurisdiction of the department shall provide, install, maintain, and operate such air contaminant monitoring devices as are reasonable, necessary, and required to determine compliance in a manner acceptable to the director, and shall supply monitoring information as directed in writing by the director. Such devices shall be available for inspection by the director, or his deputies, during all reasonable times.

C. The department shall make available to the public any records, reports or information obtained from any person pursuant to this chapter, including records, reports or information obtained or prepared by the director or a department employee, except that the information or any particular part of the information shall be considered confidential on either of the following:

#### Section 49-437. Conditional orders; standards; rules

A. The director may grant to any person a conditional order for each air pollution source which allows such person to vary from any provision of this article, any rule adopted pursuant to this article, or any requirement of a permit issued pursuant to this article if the director makes each of the following findings:

1. Issuance of the conditional order will not endanger public health or the environment, or impede attainment of the national ambient air quality standards.

2. Either of the following is true:

(a) There has been a breakdown of equipment or upset of operations beyond the control of the petitioner; the source was in compliance before the breakdown or upset; and the breakdown or upset may be corrected within a reasonable time.

(b) There is no reasonable relationship between the economic and social cost of, and benefits to be obtained from, achieving compliance.

B. The director shall adopt rules necessary for the issuance of conditional orders. Such rules shall specify the minimum requirements for petitions, and procedures for processing petitions and for public participation. For a conditional order that would vary from a requirement of the state implementation plan, the rules adopted by the director shall provide for a public hearing to receive comments on the petition. For a conditional order that would vary from a requirement of a permit issued pursuant to this article, the rules adopted by the director shall conform to the procedures established for permit revisions pursuant to section 49-426.01.

B. A holder of a conditional order may petition the director for renewals of such order. The total term of such renewals and the initial period of such order shall not exceed three years from the date of initial issuance of such order. Such petition may be filed at any time not more than sixty days nor less than thirty days prior to the expiration of such order. The director, within thirty days of receipt of such petition, shall renew the conditional order for one year if the petitioner is in compliance with and conforming to the terms and conditions imposed pursuant to section 49-439. The director may refuse to renew the conditional order, if after a public hearing held within thirty days of receipt of such petition the director finds that the petitioner is not in compliance with and conforming to the terms and conditions of the conditional order. If, after a period of three years from the date of original issuance, the petitioner is not in compliance with and conforming to such terms and conditions, the director may renew such conditional order for a total term of two additional years if the director finds that such failure to comply and conform is due to conditions beyond the control of such petitioner.

C. If the director amends or adopts any rule imposing conditions on the operation of an air pollution source which have become effective as to the source by reason of the action of the director or otherwise, and which require the implementation of control strategies necessitating the installation of additional or different air pollution control equipment, the director may renew a conditional order for an additional term. The term of the renewal shall be governed by the preceding subsections of this section, except that the total term of the renewal shall not exceed two years.

D. Except as provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, a conditional order issued by the director shall be effective when issued if:

H. In the case of a permit with a term of three or more years issued pursuant to the requirements of title V of the clean air act to a major source, the control officer shall require revisions to the permit to incorporate applicable standards and regulations adopted by the administrator pursuant to the clean air act after the issuance of the permit. The control officer shall require any revisions as expeditiously as practicable but not later than eighteen months after the promulgation of such standards and regulations. No permit revision shall be required if the effective date of the standards and regulations is after the expiration of the permit. Any permit revision required pursuant to this subsection shall be treated as a permit renewal.

I. Except as provided in section 49-426, subsection B and subsection A of this section, any person burning used oil, used oil fuel, hazardous waste or hazardous waste fuel in any machine, incinerator or device shall first obtain a permit from the control officer. Any permit issued by the control officer under this subsection shall contain, at a minimum, conditions governing:

1. Limitations on the types, amounts and feed rates of used oil, used oil fuel, hazardous waste or hazardous waste fuel which may be burned.

2. The frequency and types of fuel testing to be conducted by the person.

3. The frequency and type of emissions testing or monitoring to be conducted by the person.

4. Requirements for record keeping and reporting.

J. The board of supervisors may authorize by rule the control officer to issue a general permit for a defined class of facilities if that class of facilities has not been issued a general permit by the director for sources in that county pursuant to section 49-426, subsection H. The criteria for issuance of a general permit are those applicable to the director pursuant to section 49-426, subsection G.

K. The board of supervisors may identify by rule sources or classifications of sources for which a permit is not required and pollutant-emitting activities and emissions units at permitted sources that are not subject to inclusion in the permit. The criteria for exemptions granted pursuant to this subsection are those applicable to exemptions granted by the director pursuant to section 49-426, subsection B.

L. In determining whether a permitting threshold established pursuant to this section applies to an existing source, the control officer shall exclude particulate matter that is not subject to a national ambient air quality standard under the clean air act.

M. The board of supervisors may adopt a rule or ordinance that establishes less burdensome permit procedures and requirements for permits that are not required to be obtained pursuant to title V of the clean air act.  Until the effective date of a rule or ordinance adopted by a board of supervisors pursuant to this section, the control officer, either on the control officer's own initiative or on the request of a permit applicant, may waive requirements that are not appropriate for non-title V sources.

 

#### Section 49-480.01. Permits; changes within a source; revisions

A. The board of supervisors shall establish by rule provisions to allow changes within a source required to obtain a permit under title V of the clean air act without requiring a permit revision if all of the following conditions are met:

1. The changes do not constitute modifications under title I of the clean air act.

2. The changes do not result in an emission that is greater than the emissions allowed under the permit.

3. The source provides the control officer with a written notice of the proposed changes at least seven days in advance of the beginning of those changes.

4. The source satisfies other conditions that may be established in the rules adopted pursuant to this section. Rules adopted pursuant to this section for title V sources may prescribe a different time limit for notifications associated with emergency conditions.

B. Any permit issued pursuant to section 49-480 may be revised, revoked and reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request for a permit revision, revocation and reissuance, or a termination, or a notification filed pursuant to subsection A does not stay any effective permit condition. The control officer may require in writing that the applicant provide within a reasonable time any information that the control officer identifies as necessary for the control officer to determine if cause exists for revising, revoking and reissuing, or terminating, the permit, or to determine compliance with permit conditions.

C. The board of supervisors shall establish by rule procedures related to public and departmental reviews of changes to a permitted source. The procedures shall impose no greater procedural burden on the permittee than the procedures adopted by the director pursuant to section 49-426.01, subsection C.

#### Section 49-480.02. Appeals of permit actions

A. Within thirty days after the control officer gives notice of approval, denial or revocation of a permit, the applicant or any person who submitted comments pursuant to section 49-480, may request an appeal as provided under section 49-482. The decision after that hearing constitutes the final permit action from which judicial review may be taken pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

B. Any person who has an interest that is or may be adversely affected may commence a civil action in superior court against the control officer alleging that the control officer has failed to act in a timely manner consistent with the requirements of section 49-480. No action may be commenced before sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice to the control officer of the plaintiff's intent to file. The court has jurisdiction to require the control officer to act without additional delay.

#### Section 49-480.03. Federal hazardous air pollutant program; date specified by administrator; prohibition

A. The board of supervisors shall adopt by rule a program for administration and enforcement of the federal hazardous air pollutant program established by section 112 of the clean air act. The program shall be consistent with and meet the requirements of section 112 of the clean air act and shall contain the following provisions:

1. After the date specified by the administrator in rules adopted pursuant to section 112 (g)(1)(B) of the clean air act, no person may obtain a permit or permit revision to modify a major source of federally listed hazardous air pollutants or to construct a new major source of federally listed hazardous air pollutants, unless the control officer determines that the person will install the maximum achievable control technology for the modification or new major source. For purposes of this paragraph, the terms "major source" and "modification" have the meanings set forth in section 112(a) of the clean air act and implementing regulations adopted by the administrator. A new or modified major source of federally listed hazardous air pollutants means a major source that commences construction or a modification after rules adopted by the board of supervisors pursuant to this subsection become effective. A physical change to a source or change in the method of operation of a source is not a modification subject to this paragraph or paragraph 2 of this subsection if the change complies with section 112(g)(1) of the clean air act.

2. After the date specified by the administrator in rules adopted pursuant to section 112 (g)(1)(B) of the clean air act and until the administrator adopts emissions standards establishing the maximum achievable control technology for a source category or subcategory that includes a source subject to paragraph 1 of this subsection, the control officer shall determine the maximum achievable control technology for the modification or the new major source on a case-by-case basis. If on the basis of this case-by-case determination of the maximum achievable control technology the control officer determines that it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard, a maximum achievable control technology standard imposed pursuant to this paragraph may consist of a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, or a combination thereof.

3. If an existing source submits an application pursuant to section 49-480 which demonstrates that the source has achieved a reduction of ninety per cent or more of federally listed hazardous air pollutants or ninety-five per cent in the case of federally listed hazardous air pollutants that are particulates, the control officer shall issue a permit or permit revision allowing the source to meet an alternative emission limitation reflecting such reduction in lieu of an emission limitation promulgated by the administrator under section 112(d) of the clean air act. The application shall comply with section 112(i)(5) of the clean air act and implementing regulations adopted by the administrator. The alternative emission limitation shall apply for a period of six years from the compliance date otherwise applicable to the source under section 112(d) of the clean air act.

4. If the administrator fails to adopt a standard for a source category or subcategory within eighteen months after the deadline established for that category or subcategory pursuant to section 112(e)(1) and (3) of the clean air act, the owner or operator of an existing major source in the category or subcategory shall be required to submit a permit application for such source pursuant to section 49-480, and the control officer, acting in accordance with the procedures adopted pursuant to section 49-480, shall be required to issue a permit establishing maximum achievable control technology for the affected source on a case-by-case basis or, in the alternative, an alternative emission limitation pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection. If the control officer determines that it is not feasible to prescribe or enforce an emission standard, a maximum achievable control technology standard imposed pursuant to this paragraph may consist of a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, or a combination thereof.

5. When the administrator adopts and makes effective standards pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(f) of the clean air act the board of supervisors shall adopt those standards in the same manner as prescribed by the administrator.

6. When a reliable method of measuring emissions of a hazardous air pollutant subject to this section is not available, the control officer shall not require compliance with a numeric emission limit for that pollutant but shall instead require compliance with a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, or a combination of those standards. The provision adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall not apply to sources or modifications that commence construction after the permit program established pursuant to section 49-426 becomes effective under section 502(h) of the clean air act.

B. Where the clean air act has established provisions, including specific schedules, for the regulation of source categories pursuant to section 112(e)(5) and 112(n) of the clean air act, those provisions and schedules shall apply to the regulation of those source categories under subsection A of this section.

C. For any category or subcategory of facilities licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission, the control officer shall not adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting emissions of radionuclides which is more stringent than the standard or limitation adopted by the administrator pursuant to section 112 of the clean air act.

D. When the administrator makes one of the following findings pursuant to section 112(n)(1)(A) of the clean air act the finding is effective for purposes of the county's administration and enforcement of the federal hazardous air pollutant program in the same manner as prescribed by the administrator:

1. A finding that regulation is not appropriate or necessary.

2. A finding that alternative control strategies should be applied.

E. Notwithstanding any other law, a county board of supervisors shall not adopt and the control officer shall not enforce a rule or ordinance that requires compliance with subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section until after the date specified by the administrator as provided in subsection A, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section.

#### Section 49-480.04. County program for control of hazardous air pollutants

A. Within six months after the adoption of rules pursuant to section 49-426.06, subsection A, the board of supervisors shall by rule establish a county program for the control of hazardous air pollutants meeting the requirements of this section. The program established pursuant to this section shall apply to the following sources:

1. Sources that emit or have the potential to emit with controls, ten tons per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or twenty-five tons per year or more of any combination of hazardous air pollutants.

2. Sources that are within a category designated pursuant to section 49-426.05 and that emit or have the potential to emit, with controls, one ton per year or more of any hazardous air pollutant or two and one-half tons per year of any combination of hazardous air pollutants.

B. After the effective date of the rules adopted pursuant to subsection A of this section, a person shall not commence the construction or modification of a source that is subject to this section without first obtaining a permit or permit revision meeting the requirements of section 49-480 and subsection C or D of this section. A physical change to a source or change in the method of operation of a source is not a modification subject to this section if the change satisfies any of the following conditions:

1. The change complies with section 112(g)(1) of the clean air act.

2. The change, together with any other changes implemented or planned by the source, qualifies the source for an alternative emission limitation pursuant to section 112(i)(5) of the clean air act.

3. The change is required under a standard imposed pursuant to section 112(d) or 112(f) of the clean air act and the change is implemented after the administrator promulgates the standard.

C. A permit issued to a new or modified source that is subject to the county hazardous air pollutant program under subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section shall impose the maximum achievable control technology for the new source or modification, unless the applicant demonstrates pursuant to subsection D of this section that the imposition of maximum achievable control technology is not necessary to avoid adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects. A permit or permit revision issued to a new or modified source that is subject to the county hazardous air pollutant program under subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section shall impose hazardous air pollutant reasonably available control technology for the new source or modification, unless the applicant demonstrates pursuant to subsection D of this section that the imposition of hazardous air pollutant reasonably available control technology is not necessary to avoid adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects. When a reliable method of measuring emissions of a hazardous air pollutant subject to this section is not available, the control officer shall not require compliance with a numeric emission limit for the pollutant but shall instead require compliance with a design, equipment, work practice or operational standard, or a combination thereof. Standards imposed pursuant to this subsection shall apply only to hazardous air pollutants emitted in amounts exceeding the de minimis amounts established by the administrator or by the director pursuant to section 49-426.06, subsection B. The control officer shall not impose a standard under this subsection that would require the application of measures that are incompatible with measures required under a standard imposed pursuant to section 49-480.03, subsection A.

D. If the owner or operator of a new source or modification subject to this section establishes that the imposition of maximum achievable control technology or hazardous air pollutant reasonably available control technology is not necessary to avoid adverse effects to human health or adverse environmental effects by conducting a scientifically sound risk management analysis and submitting the results to the control officer with the permit application for the new source or modification, the control officer shall exempt the source from the imposition of such technology. The risk management analysis may take into account the following factors:

1. The estimated actual exposure of persons living in the vicinity of the source.

2. Available epidemiological or other health studies.

3. Risks presented by background concentrations of hazardous air pollutants.

4. Uncertainties in risk assessment methodology or other health assessment techniques.

5. Negative health or environmental consequences that would result from efforts to reduce the risk.

6. The technological and commercial availability of control methods beyond those otherwise required for the source and the cost of such methods.

E. If maximum achievable control technology or hazardous air pollutant reasonably available control technology standard has been established in a general permit for a defined class of sources pursuant to subsection C of this section and sections 49-480 and 49-426, subsection H, the owner or operator of a source within that class may obtain a variance from the standard by complying with subsection D of this section at the time the source applies to be permitted under the general permit. If the owner or operator makes the demonstration required by subsection D of this section and otherwise qualifies for the general permit, the control officer shall, in accordance with the procedures established pursuant to sections 49-480 and 49-426, approve the application and issue a permit granting a variance from the specific provisions of the general permit relating to the standard. Except as otherwise modified by the variance, the general permit shall govern the source.

F. If the clean air act has established provisions, including specific schedules, for the regulation of source categories pursuant to section 112(e)(5) and 112(n) of the clean air act, those provisions and schedules shall apply to the regulation of those source categories under subsection B of this section.

G. For any category or subcategory of facilities licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission, the control officer shall not adopt or enforce any standard or limitation respecting emissions of radionuclides which is more stringent than the standard or limitation adopted by the administrator pursuant to section 112 of the clean air act.

H. Except as otherwise provided in subsection I of this section, the program established pursuant to this section shall apply only to source categories designated by the director pursuant to section 49-426.05, subsection A and to hazardous air pollutants designated by the director pursuant to section 49-426.03, subsection A and section 49-426.04.

I. When a new source that is within a category that has not been designated pursuant to section 49-426.05, subsection A submits an application for a permit pursuant to section 49-480, the control officer may suspend action on the application pending the designation of the category by the director pursuant to section 49-426.05, subsection A, if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The director makes the finding required by section 49-426.05, subsection A for the category to which the source belongs.

2. The control officer provides notice of the director's finding and the control officer's intent to suspend action on the application to the applicant on or before the date that a completeness determination is due under sections 49-480 and 49-426.

3. The applicant does not elect to comply with subsection C or D of this section.

J. For purposes of subsection A of this section, in determining potential to emit, the control officer shall consider controls that are enforceable under any federal law or regulation, state or local law or rule or that are inherent in the design of the source.

K. In determining whether emissions from a source or modification exceed the thresholds prescribed by subsection A or B of this section, the control officer shall exclude particulate matter emissions that consist of natural crustal material and are produced either by natural forces, such as wind or erosion, or by anthropogenic activities, such as agricultural operations, excavation, blasting, drilling, handling, storage, earth moving, crushing or grinding of crustal materials and traffic over paved or unpaved roads, or other similar activities. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the regulation of emissions of crustal materials as particulate matter pursuant to other sections of this chapter.

#### Section 49-481. Grant or denial of applications

A. The control officer shall deny a permit or revision if the applicant does not show that every such source is so designed, controlled, or equipped with such air pollution control equipment that it may be expected to operate without emitting or without causing to be emitted air contaminants in violation of the provisions of this article and the rules adopted by the board of supervisors.

B. Prior to acting on an application for a permit, the control officer may require the applicant to provide and maintain such facilities as are necessary for sampling and testing purposes in order to secure information that will disclose the nature, extent, quantity or degree of air contaminants discharged into the atmosphere from the source described in the application. In the event of such a requirement, the control officer shall notify the applicant in writing of the type and characteristics of such facilities.

C. In acting upon an application for a permit renewal, if the control officer finds that such source has been constructed not in accordance with any prior permit or revision issued pursuant to section 49-480.01, he shall require the person to obtain a permit revision or deny the application for such permit. The control officer shall not accept any further application for a permit for such source so constructed until he finds that such source has been reconstructed in accordance with the prior permit or a revision, or a revision to the permit has been obtained.

D. After a decision on a permit or revision, the control officer shall notify the applicant and any person who filed a comment on the permit pursuant to section 49-480 or the revision pursuant to section 49-480.01 in writing of the decision, and if the permit is denied, the reasons for such denial. Service of this notification may be made in person or by first class mail. The control officer shall not accept a further application unless the applicant has corrected the reasons for the objections specified by the control officer as reasons for such denial.

#### Section 49-482. Appeals to hearing board

A. Within thirty days after notice is given by the control officer of approval or denial of a permit, permit revision or conditional order, the applicant and any person who filed a comment on the permit or permit revision pursuant to section 49-480, subsection B and section 49-426, subsection D, or on the conditional order pursuant to section 49-492, subsection C, may petition the hearing board, in writing, for a public hearing, which shall be held within thirty days after receipt of the petition. The hearing board, after notice and a public hearing, may sustain, modify or reverse the action of the control officer.

B. Any person having an interest that is or may be adversely affected may commence a civil action in superior court against the control officer alleging that the control officer has failed to act in a timely manner as provided in section 49-480, subsection B and section 49-426, subsection C. No action may be commenced before sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice to the control officer. The court has jurisdiction to require the control officer to act without additional delay.

#### Section 49-483. Permit transfers; notice; appeal

A. A permit shall not be transferable, whether by operation of law or otherwise, either from one location to another, or from one piece of equipment to another.

B. The provisions of subsection A shall not apply to mobile or portable machinery or equipment which is transferred from one location to another after notification to the control officer of the transfer.

C. A permit may be transferred, whether by operation of law or otherwise, from one person to another, provided that prior to the transfer, the person holding the permit notifies the control officer in writing of the name, address, telephone number and statutory agent of the person to whom the permit will be transferred, the effective date of the proposed transfer and other information the board of supervisors may determine to be necessary by rule. The control officer shall prescribe procedures for such notification.

D. If the control officer determines that the transferee is not capable of operating the source in compliance with the requirements of this article, rules adopted under this article and the conditions established in the permit, the transfer shall be denied. In order for the denial to be effective, notice of the control officer's denial, including the reasons for the denial, shall be issued within ten working days of the control officer's receipt of the notice of the proposed transfer.

E. Denial of a permit transfer is appealable by the transferor and the transferee to the air pollution hearing board in the same manner as prescribed for denial of a permit in section 49-482.

#### Section 49-484. Expiration of permit

An installation permit shall expire two years from the date of its issuance.

#### Section 49-485. Posting of permit

A person who has been granted an operating permit, shall firmly affix such permit, an approved facsimile of such permit, or other approved identification bearing the permit number upon such machine, equipment, incinerator, device or other article for which the operating permit is issued in such a manner as to be clearly visible and accessible. In the event that such machine, equipment, incinerator, device or other article is so constructed or operated that such permit cannot be so placed, the permit shall be mounted so as to be clearly visible in an accessible place within a reasonable distance of such machine, equipment, incinerator, device or other article, or maintained readily available at all times on the operating premises.

#### Section 49-486. Notice by building permit agencies

All agencies that issue building permits shall examine the plans and specifications submitted by an applicant for a building permit to determine if an installation permit will possibly be required under the provisions of section 49-480. If it appears possible that such installation permit will be required, the agency shall give written notice to such applicant to contact the control officer or the department of environmental quality and shall furnish a copy of such notice to the control officer and the department.

#### Section 49-487. Classification and reporting; confidentiality of records

A. The board of supervisors by rules which are equal to or more restrictive than those adopted by the director of environmental quality shall classify air contaminant sources according to levels and types of emissions and other characteristics which relate to air pollution, and shall require reporting for any such class or classes. Reports may be required as to physical outlets, processes and fuels used, the nature and duration of emissions and such other information as is relevant to air pollution and deemed necessary by the board.

B. The owner, lessee, or operator of a potential air contaminant source shall provide, install, maintain, and operate such air contaminant monitoring devices as are reasonable and required to determine compliance in a manner acceptable to the control officer, and shall supply monitoring information as directed in writing by the control officer. Such devices shall be available for inspection by the control officer during all reasonable times.

C. Any records, reports or information obtained from any person under this chapter, including records, reports or information obtained or prepared by the control officer or a county employee, shall be available to the public, except that the information or any part of the information shall be considered confidential on either of the following:

1. A showing, satisfactory to the control officer, by any person that the information or a part of the information if made public would divulge the trade secrets of the person.

2. A determination by the county attorney that disclosure of the information or a particular part of the information would be detrimental to an ongoing criminal investigation or to an ongoing or contemplated civil enforcement action under this chapter in superior court.

D. Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, the following information shall be available to the public:

1. The name and address of any permit applicant or permittee.

2. The chemical constituents, concentrations and amounts of any emission of any air contaminant.

3. The existence or level of a concentration of an air pollutant in the environment.

#### Section 49-488. Special inspection warrant

A. The control officer and his deputies charged under this chapter or the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter with powers or duties involving inspection of real or personal property including buildings, building premises and building contents for the purpose of air pollution control shall be authorized to present themselves before a magistrate and apply for, obtain and execute special inspection warrants. Such inspections shall be limited to property other than the interior of structures used as private residences.

B. Upon showing by the affidavit of the control officer or his deputies that consent to entry for inspection purposes has been refused or circumstances justify the failure to seek such consent, special inspection warrants may be issued by a magistrate for inspection of public or private, real or personal properties. Such warrants shall not be necessary in the case of an emergency where there is an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons.

C. The warrant shall be in substantially the following form: "County of +++++++++++++++, state of Arizona to any control officer or deputy control officer in the county of +++++++++++++++ proof by affidavit having been this day made before me by (person or persons whose affidavit has been taken) that in and upon certain premises in the (city, town or county) of +++++++++++++++ and more particularly described as follows: (describe the premises with reasonable particularity) there now exists a reasonable governmental interest to determine if said premises comply with (section +++++++++++++++ of the Arizona Revised Statutes) and/or (section +++++++++++++++ of regulation or ordinance), you are therefore commanded in the day time (or during reasonable business hours), to make an inspection of said premises as soon as practicable.  Date, signature and title of office." The endorsement on the warrant shall be in substantially the following form: "Received by me +++++++++++++++ 19++, at +++++ o'clock ++++ (name of control officer or deputy control officer)."  The return of officer shall be in substantially the following form: "I hereby certify that by virtue of the within warrant I searched the named premises and found the following things (describe findings).  Dated this +++++++++++++++ day of +++++++++++++++ 19++++ (name of control officer or deputy control officer)."

D. The warrant may be served by the control officer or his deputies mentioned in its directions, but by no other person except in aid of the control officer or his deputies, on his requiring it, the control officer or his deputies being present and acting in its execution.

E. A warrant shall be executed and returned to the magistrate who issued it within ten days after its date. After the expiration of that time, the warrant shall unless executed be void.

F. Any person who knowingly refuses to permit an inspection lawfully authorized by warrant issued pursuant to this article is guilty of a petty offense.

#### Section 49-490. Hearings on orders of abatement

A. An order of abatement issued by the control officer shall become effective immediately upon the expiration of the time during which a request for a hearing may be made pursuant to section 49-511 unless the person or persons named in such order shall have made a timely request for a hearing before the hearing board. If a hearing is requested, the hearing board shall hold the hearing within thirty days from receipt of the request unless such time is extended by the hearing board. Written notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be sent by the hearing board to the person or persons requesting the hearing and to the control officer at least fifteen days before the hearing.

B. If the board, after the hearing, determines that the act or acts set forth in the order constitute a violation of any provision of this article or of the rules adopted pursuant to this article or any requirement of a permit or conditional order issued pursuant to this article and that no conditional order is justified, the board shall affirm or modify the order for abatement. The order may be conditional and require a person to refrain from the particular act or acts unless certain conditions are met.

#### Section 49-491. Conditional orders; standards; rules

A. The director may grant to any person a conditional order for each air pollution source which allows such person to vary from any provision of this article, any rule adopted pursuant to this article, or any requirement of a permit issued pursuant to this article if the control officer makes each of the following findings:

1. Issuance of the conditional order will not endanger public health or the environment, or impede attainment of the national ambient air quality standards.

2. Either of the following is true:

(a) There has been a breakdown of equipment or upset of operations beyond the control of the petitioner; the source was in compliance before the breakdown or upset; and the breakdown or upset may be corrected within a reasonable time.

(b) There is no reasonable relationship between the economic and social cost of, and benefits to be obtained from, achieving compliance.

B. The board of supervisors shall adopt rules necessary for the issuance of conditional orders. Such rules shall specify the minimum requirements for petitions, and procedures for processing petitions and for public participation. For a conditional order that would vary from a requirement of the state implementation plan, the rules adopted by the board of supervisors shall provide for a public hearing to receive comments on the petition. For a conditional order that would vary from a requirement of a permit issued pursuant to this article, the rules adopted by the board of supervisors shall conform to the procedures established for permit revisions pursuant to section 49-480.01.

#### Section 49-492. Petition for conditional order; publication; public hearing

A. A person who seeks a conditional order shall file a petition with the control officer.

B. If the issuance of the conditional order requires a public hearing, the control officer shall set a hearing date within thirty days after the filing of the petition. The hearing date shall be within sixty days after the filing of the petition.

C. Notice of the filing of a petition for a conditional order and of the hearing date on said petition shall be published in the manner provided in section 49-498. The notice shall state that any person may submit comments on the petition. A written comment shall state the name of the person and the person's agent or attorney and shall clearly set forth reasons why the petition should or should not be granted. Grounds for comment shall be limited to whether the petition meets the criteria for issuance of a conditional order prescribed in section 49-491.

#### Section 49-493. Decisions on petitions for conditional order; terms and conditions

A. Within thirty days after the conclusion of the hearing held pursuant to section 49-492, subsection B, or, if no hearing is held, within sixty days after the filing of the petition, the control officer shall deny the petition or grant the petition on such terms and conditions as the director deems appropriate.

B. The terms and conditions which are imposed as a condition to the granting or the continued existence of a conditional order shall include but not be limited to:

1. A detailed plan for completion of corrective steps needed to conform to the provisions of this article, the rules adopted pursuant to this article, and the requirements of the permit issued pursuant to this article.

2. A requirement that necessary construction shall begin as expeditiously as practicable.

3. Such written reports as may be required.

4. The right to make periodic inspection of the facilities for which the conditional order is granted.

C. A reasonable fee as may be prescribed by the control officer shall be deposited in the special public health fund.

#### Section 49-494. Term of conditional order; effective date

A. A conditional order issued by the control officer shall be valid for such period as the control officer prescribes but in no event for more than one year in the case of a source that is required to obtain a permit pursuant to this article and title V of the clean air act, and three years in the case of any other source that is required to obtain a permit pursuant to this article.

B. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, a conditional order issued by the control officer shall be effective when issued.

1. If the conditional order varies from the requirements of the state implementation plan, the conditional order shall be submitted to the administrator as a revision to the state implementation plan pursuant to section 110(L) of the clean air act, and shall become effective upon approval by the administrator.

2. If the conditional order varies from the requirements of a permit issued for a facility that is required to obtain a permit pursuant to title V of the clean air act, the conditional order shall be submitted to the administrator if required by section 505 of the clean air act, and in such case shall be effective at the end of the review period specified in such section, unless objected to within such period by the administrator.

#### Section 49-495. Suspension and revocation of conditional order

If the terms and conditions of the conditional order are being violated, the control officer may seek to revoke or suspend the conditional order granted. In such event, the control officer shall serve notice of such violation on the holder of the conditional order in the manner provided in section 49-498. The notice shall specify the nature of such violation and the date on which a hearing will be held by the hearing board to determine if such a violation has occurred and whether the conditional order should be suspended or revoked. The date of said hearing shall be within thirty days from the date said notice is served upon the holder of the conditional order.

#### Section 49-496. Decisions of hearing board; subpoenas; effective date

A. All decisions of the hearing board, including the majority of opinion and all concurring and dissenting opinions, shall be in writing and shall be of public record.

B. A majority of the total membership of the hearing board shall concur in a decision for it to have effect.

#### Section 49-497.01. Judicial review of hearing board or administrative law judge decisions

A. Except as provided in this section, a hearing board decision or a decision of an administrative law judge in lieu of a hearing board is subject to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

B. Within thirty days after service of notice of a final decision or order of the board or administrative law judge, or an order denying a rehearing timely applied for, any person who was a party of record in the proceedings before the board or administrative law judge, including the control officer or department authorized or designated to enforce air pollution regulations, may appeal the decision or order to the superior court in the county in which the hearing was conducted and the scope of the review shall be determined pursuant to section 12-910.

C. A notice of appeal, designating the grounds for appeal, and a demand in writing for a certified transcript of the testimony and exhibits shall be filed with the court and served on the board or administrative law judge.  After receipt of the demand, accompanied by payment of a fee of the current prevailing rate for transcripts and one dollar for certification of the transcript, the board or administrative law judge shall make and certify the transcript and file it with the clerk of the court to which the appeal has been taken within thirty days, unless extended by agreement of the parties or order of the court.

D. If an appeal is taken from an order or decision of the board or administrative law judge, the order or decision remains in effect pending final determination of the matter, unless stayed by the court on a hearing, after notice to the board or administrative law judge, and on a finding by the court that there is probable cause for appeal and that great or irreparable damage may result to the petitioner warranting the stay.

E. An appeal may be taken to the court of appeals from the order of the superior court as in other civil cases.  Proceedings under this section shall be given precedence and brought to trial ahead of other litigation concerning private interests and other matters that do not affect public health and welfare.

#### Section 49-497.02. Judicial review of appealable agency action not subject to review by hearing board or administrative law judge

A. Any person having an interest that is or may be adversely affected may commence a civil action in superior court against a control officer alleging that the control officer has failed to act in a timely manner as provided in section 49-480, subsection B and section 49-426, subsection C. No action may be commenced before sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice to the control officer.  The court has jurisdiction to require the control officer to act without additional delay.

B. Except as provided in subsections C and D of this section, a person whose legal rights, duties or privileges were determined by an appealable agency action, or any person who will be adversely affected by an appealable agency action, may commence a civil action in superior court against the control officer alleging that the action was not supported by substantial evidence, is contrary to law, is arbitrary and capricious, or is an abuse of discretion.  Review of the appealable agency action may be obtained without first obtaining a review by a hearing board or administrative law judge. The appeal in superior court shall be governed by the Arizona rules of procedure for special actions.

C. This section does not apply to a decision or action that must be appealed to the hearing board under section 49-476.01, 49-480.02, 49-482, 49-490 or 49-511 or to a final administrative decision obtained by an administrative appeal under section 49-471.15. Judicial review of those decisions or actions shall be as provided under section 49-497.01 rather than under subsection B of this section.

D. An action pursuant to subsection B of this section shall not be commenced before sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice to the control officer.

E. A sixty day notice under this section shall be filed with the control officer within thirty days of service of notice of the appealable agency action. The notice of appeal shall identify the party, the party's address, the action being appealed and shall contain a concise statement of the reasons for the appeal.

F.

#### Section 49-501. Unlawful open burning; exceptions; civil penalty; definition

A. Notwithstanding the provisions of any other section of this article: 1. It is unlawful for any person to ignite, cause to be ignited, permit to be ignited, or suffer, allow, or maintain any open outdoor fire except as provided in this section.

2. From May 1 through September 30 each year, it is unlawful for any person to ignite, cause to be ignited, permit to be ignited or suffer, allow or maintain any open outdoor fire in area A as defined in section 49-541.

B. The following fires are excepted from this section:

1. Fires used only for cooking of food or for providing warmth for human beings or the branding of animals or the use of orchard heaters for the purpose of frost protection in farming or nursery operations.

2. Any fire set or permitted by any public officer in the performance of official duty, if such fire is set or permission given for the purpose of weed abatement, the prevention of a fire hazard, or instruction in the methods of fighting fires.

3. Fires set by or permitted by the director of the department of agriculture or county agricultural agents of the county for the purpose of disease and pest prevention.

4. Fires set by or permitted by the federal government or any of its departments, agencies or agents or the state or any of its agencies, departments or political subdivisions for the purpose of watershed rehabilitation or control through vegetative manipulation.

5. Fires permitted by any rule or regulation issued pursuant to this article, by any conditional permit issued by a hearing board established under this article or by any rule or conditional permit issued pursuant to article 2 of this chapter when the department of environmental quality pursuant to section 49-402 has assumed jurisdiction of the county in which the fire is located.

6. Fires set for the disposal of dangerous materials where there is no safe alternate method of disposal.

The setting of any such fire shall be conducted in a manner and at such time as approved by the control officer or the director of environmental quality, unless doing so would defeat the purpose of the exemption.

D. Notwithstanding section 49-107, the director may delegate authority for the issuance of open burning permits to a county, city, town or fire district. A county, city, town or fire district that has been delegated authority for the issuance of open burning permits may assign the issuance of these permits to a private fire protection service provider that performs fire protection services within that county, city, town or fire district. Any private fire protection service provider that is authorized to issue open burning permits pursuant to this subsection shall maintain a copy of all currently effective permits issued including a means of contacting the person authorized by the permit to set the fire in the event that an order to extinguish the open burning is issued. Permits issued pursuant to this subsection shall contain both of the following:

1. Conditions that limit the manner and time of setting the fire and that are consistent with this section and rules adopted pursuant to this section.

2. A provision that all burning be extinguished at the discretion of the director or the director's authorized representative during periods of inadequate atmospheric smoke dispersion, periods of excessive visibility impairment that could adversely affect public safety or periods when smoke is blown into populated areas so as to create a public nuisance.

E. The director may issue a general permit to allow persons engaged in farming or ranching on forty acres or more in an unincorporated area to burn household waste, as defined in section 49-701, that is generated on site, if no household waste collection and disposal service is available. The general permit shall include the following:

1. Conditions governing the method, manner and times for burning.

2. Limitation on materials which may be burned, including a prohibition on burning of materials which generate noxious fumes.

3. A requirement that any person seeking coverage under the general permit shall register with the director on a form prescribed by the director. Upon receipt of a registration form, the director shall notify the county in which the farm or ranch is located of such registration.

4. A statement that the director, a local air pollution control officer, or any other public officer may order the extinguishment of burning or may prohibit burning during periods of inadequate smoke dispersion or excessive visibility impairment or at other times when public health or safety could be adversely affected.

F. Nothing in this section is intended to permit any practice which is a violation of any statute, ordinance, rule or regulation in a county with a population in excess of one million two hundred thousand persons.  Notwithstanding any other law, such a county shall prohibit by ordinance the use of wood burning chimineas, outdoor fire pits and similar outdoor fires on those days for which the county has issued a no burn day restriction.

G. A person who violates any provision of this section may be served a notice of violation and be subject to the enforcement provisions of this article to the same extent as a person violating any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this article, except that a violation that lasts no more than twenty-four hours and that is the first violation committed by that person is subject to a civil penalty of no more than five hundred dollars.

H. For the purposes of this section, "open outdoor fire" means any combustion of combustible material of any type outdoors, in the open where the products of combustion are not directed through a flue.  For the purposes of this subsection, "flue" means any duct or passage for air, gases or the like, such as a stack or chimney.

G. A person who operates a source that is required to have a permit issued pursuant to this article and that is subject to a material permit condition other than an emission standard identified in subsection C of this section, and who knowingly violates such permit condition is guilty of a class 6 felony. For purposes of this subsection a material permit condition means a permit condition determined by the director by rule to be material pursuant to section 49-464, subsection G.

H. A person who is required to obtain a permit before commencing construction of a source both under this article and under title V of the clean air act, and who knowingly commences construction of such source without a permit issued by the control officer is guilty of a class 6 felony.

I. A person who operates a source that is not identified in subsection B of this section and that requires a permit under this article, and who knowingly operates such source without a permit issued by the control officer and without having filed a complete application for renewal of an existing permit in accordance with this article is guilty of a class 6 felony.

J. A person who is required by the control officer pursuant to this article to operate a monitoring device, and who knowingly fails to maintain, operate or repair such monitoring device in order to render the device inaccurate is guilty of a class 6 felony.

K. A person who is required to obtain a permit to commence construction of a source under this article but not under title V of the clean air act, and who acting with criminal negligence commences construction of such source without a permit issued by the director is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.

3. Violates a fee or filing requirement established both under this article and under title V of the clean air act.

4. Violates any other provision of this article for which a penalty is not otherwise prescribed.

M. Under this section, a knowing violation that continues for more than one day, but that results from a single act or series of related acts, constitutes the commission of a single offense.

N. In determining the amount of a fine under this section, the court shall consider all of the following:

1. The seriousness of the violation.

2. As an aggravating factor only, the economic benefit, if any, resulting from the violation.

3. Any history of that violation.

7. Payment by the violator of penalties previously assessed for the same violation.

8. Other aggravating and mitigating factor as the court deems relevant.

O. It shall be an affirmative defense to any prosecution under subsection A of this section that the conduct charged was freely consented to by the person endangered and that the danger and conduct charged were reasonably foreseeable hazards of either of the following:

1. An occupation, business or profession.

2. Medical treatment or medical or scientific experimentation conducted by professionally approved methods provided that the person endangered was made aware of the risk involved in the treatment or experimentation prior to giving consent.

P. It shall be an affirmative defense to any prosecution for violation of an emission standard or opacity standard under subsection C or G or subsection L, paragraph 1, 2 or 4 of this section that both of the following conditions were satisfied:

1. The violation was reported by verbal or facsimile notification to the control officer within twenty-four hours after the source first learned of the violation.

2. The owner or operator of the source provided written notification to the control officer containing all of the following information within seventy-two hours following the verbal or facsimile notification:

(a) Confirmation of the violation for which verbal or facsimile notification was provided.

(b) Identification of the practicable corrective measures that have been undertaken or will be undertaken to control and minimize emissions until compliance with the applicable standard is achieved.

In the case of continuous or recurring violations, the notification requirement shall be satisfied if the source provides the required notification after violations are first detected and includes in such notification an estimate of the time the violations will continue. Violations occurring after the estimated time period shall require additional notification pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.

Q. It shall be an affirmative defense to any prosecution under subsection B, H, I or K of this section for operating a source or commencing construction without a permit that, after accurately disclosing in writing all relevant information that is necessary to assess the requirement to obtain a permit and that is requested by a permitting authority, the defendant obtained and relied upon the written advice of a permitting authority that no permit was necessary. Failure of a permitting authority to respond in writing to a request for a determination under this subsection within fourteen days after receiving the information described above shall be deemed to be advice that no permit was necessary for purposes of this subsection.

R. The defendant may establish an affirmative defense provided by this section by a preponderance of the evidence.

S. Under this section, to prove a knowing violation the state must prove actual knowledge of circumstances constituting each element of the offense which, as defined, requires proof of a culpable mental state. Actual knowledge may be proved by either direct or circumstantial evidence, including evidence that the person deliberately avoided acquiring such knowledge. A person's knowledge may not be inferred merely by his or her position within an enterprise.

T. For purposes of this section, the term "emission standard" means a numeric limitation on the volume or concentration of air pollutants in emissions from a source or a specific design, equipment or work practice standard, the purpose of which is to eliminate or reduce the volume or concentration of pollutants emitted by a source. The term emission standard does not include opacity standards. Violations of emission standards shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the applicable regulations issued by the administrator or the director or control officer.

#### Section 49-515. Precedence of actions

For the benefit of the people of the state, court actions and proceedings brought under this article shall be given precedence and brought to trial ahead of other litigation concerning private interests and other matters that do not affect public health and welfare.

#### Section 49-516. Preservation of rights

It is the purpose of this article to provide additional and cumulative remedies to prevent, abate and control air pollution in the state. Except as prescribed by section 49-402, subsection C, nothing contained in this article shall be construed to abridge or alter rights of action or remedies in equity under the common law or statutory law, criminal or civil, nor shall any provisions of this article, or any act done by virtue thereof, be construed as estopping the state or any municipality or owners of land from the exercise of their rights in equity or under the common law or statutory law to suppress nuisances or to abate pollution.

#### Section 49-542. Emissions inspection program; powers and duties of director; administration; periodic inspection; minimum standards and rules; exceptions; definition

 

(L21, Ch. 27, sec. 2 & Ch. 116, sec. 1)

 

A. The director shall administer a comprehensive annual or biennial emissions inspection program that shall require the inspection of vehicles in this state pursuant to this article and applicable administrative rules.  Such inspection is required for vehicles that are registered in area A and area B, for those vehicles owned by a person who is subject to section 15-1444 or 15-1627 and for those vehicles registered outside of area A or area B but used to commute to the driver's principal place of employment located within area A or area B.  Inspection in other counties of the state shall commence on the director's approval of an application by a county board of supervisors for participation in such inspection program. In all counties with a population of three hundred fifty thousand or fewer persons, except for the portion of counties that contain any portion of area A, the director shall as conditions dictate provide for testing to determine the effect of vehicle-related pollution on ambient air quality in all communities with a metropolitan area population of twenty thousand persons or more.  If such testing detects the violation of state ambient air quality standards by vehicle-related pollution, the director shall forward a full report of such violation to the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and the governor.

B. The state's annual or biennial emissions inspection program shall provide for vehicle inspections at official emissions inspection stations or at fleet emissions inspection stations or may provide for remote vehicle inspection.  Each official inspection station in area A shall employ at least one technical assistant who is available during the station's hours of operation to provide assistance for persons who fail the emissions test. An official or fleet emissions inspection station permit shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or removed to another location except on such terms and conditions as the director may prescribe.  The director shall establish a pilot program to provide for remote vehicle inspections in area A and area B. The director shall operate the pilot program for at least three consecutive years and shall complete the pilot program before July 1, 2025.  On completion of the pilot program, the director shall submit to the joint legislative budget committee and the office of the governor a report summarizing the results of the pilot program.  The director shall submit the report before the department implements any full scale remote vehicle inspection program and shall include in the report a summary of the data collected during the pilot program and a certification by the director that, based on the data collected during the pilot program, a full scale implementation of a remote vehicle inspection program will increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of the vehicle emissions inspection program.

C. Vehicles required to be inspected and registered in this state, except those provided for in section 49-546, shall be inspected, for the purpose of complying with the registration requirement pursuant to subsection D of this section, in accordance with the provisions of this article not more than ninety days before each registration expiration date. A vehicle may be submitted voluntarily for inspection more than ninety days before the registration expiration date on payment of the prescribed inspection fee.  That voluntary inspection may be considered as compliance with the registration requirement pursuant to subsection D of this section only on conditions prescribed by the director.

D. A vehicle shall not be registered until such vehicle has passed the emissions inspection and the tampering inspection prescribed in subsection G of this section or has been issued a certificate of waiver.  A certificate of waiver shall only be issued one time to a vehicle after January 1, 1997. If any vehicle to be registered is being sold by a dealer licensed to sell motor vehicles pursuant to title 28, the cost of any inspection and any repairs necessary to pass the inspection shall be borne by the dealer.  A dealer who is licensed to sell motor vehicles pursuant to title 28 and whose place of business is located in area A or area B shall not deliver any vehicle to the retail purchaser until the vehicle passes any inspection required by this article, except if the vehicle is a collectible vehicle and the retail purchaser obtains collectible vehicle or classic automobile insurance coverage as prescribed in subsection Z of this section before delivery or the vehicle is otherwise exempt under subsection J of this section.

E. On the registration of a vehicle that has complied with the minimum emissions standards pursuant to this section or is otherwise exempt under this section, the registering officer shall issue an air quality compliance sticker to the registered owner that shall be placed on the vehicle as prescribed by rule adopted by the department of transportation or issue a modified year validating tab as prescribed by rule adopted by the department of transportation. Those persons who reside outside of area A or area B but who elect to test their vehicle or are required to test their vehicle pursuant to this section and who comply with the minimum emissions standards pursuant to this section or are otherwise exempt under this section shall remit a compliance form, as prescribed by the department of transportation, and proof of compliance issued at an official emissions inspection station to the department of transportation along with the appropriate fees. The department of transportation shall then issue the person an air quality compliance sticker that shall be placed on the vehicle as prescribed by rule adopted by the department of transportation. The registering officer or the department of transportation shall collect an air quality compliance fee of $.25.

#### Section 49-761. Rulemaking authority for solid waste facilities; exemption; financial assurance; recycling facilities

A. The department shall adopt rules regarding the storage, processing, treatment and disposal of solid waste as prescribed by subsections B through M of this section. In adopting rules, the department shall consider the nature of the waste streams at the facilities to be regulated. The department shall also consider other applicable federal and state laws and rules in an effort to avoid practices or requirements that duplicate, are inconsistent with or will result in dual regulation with other applicable rules and laws.  Facilities that obtain and maintain coverage under a general permit established by the department pursuant to section 49-706 are exempt from rules adopted pursuant to this section. In adopting rules for solid waste facilities, the director may include requirements for corrective actions in response to a release, as defined in section 49-281, from a solid waste facility that violates or results in a violation of any provision of this chapter, rule adopted pursuant to this chapter or solid waste facility plan approved pursuant to this chapter. These rules shall be consistent with section 49-762.08, subsection B, subsection C, paragraphs 1 and 2 and subsections D and E.

B. For purposes of administering 42 United States Code section 6945, as amended November 8, 1984, 40 C.F.R. part 258 is adopted by reference except as prescribed by paragraph 2 of this subsection. This subsection, as it applies to municipal solid waste landfills, governs if there is any conflict between this subsection and any other statute relating to solid waste. Municipal solid waste landfill facility plans submitted pursuant to section 49-762 shall comply with this subsection.  In administering this subsection or in adopting or administering any rules adopted pursuant to this subsection, the department shall ensure that any discretion allowed to a director of an approved state pursuant to the federal regulations is maintained. The following apply to the department's administration of 42 United States Code section 6945 and to the department's adoption of rules for municipal solid waste landfills:

1. The department may adopt rules for municipal solid waste landfills. Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph shall not be more stringent than or conflict with 40 C.F.R. part 258 for nonprocedural standards, except that the department may adopt aquifer protection standards that are more stringent than 40 C.F.R. part 258 if those standards are consistent with and not more stringent than standards developed pursuant to chapter 2, article 3 of this title, or if the standards are adopted pursuant to article 9 of this chapter. Rules adopted pursuant to this paragraph are effective on the concurrence of the administrator with this state's municipal solid waste landfill program.

2. 40 C.F.R. part 258, table I is not adopted in its entirety. The department shall use aquifer water quality standards that have been adopted by the department pursuant to section 49-223 and shall use those portions of table I that are more restrictive than the standards adopted pursuant to section 49-223.

C. The department shall adopt rules for those solid waste land disposal facilities that are not municipal solid waste landfills and that are not regulated by the coal combustion residuals program established pursuant to article 11 of this chapter. Rules adopted pursuant to this subsection shall not be more stringent than or conflict with 40 C.F.R. part 257, subparts A and B for nonprocedural standards, except that the department may adopt aquifer protection standards that are more stringent than 40 C.F.R. part 257, subparts A and B if these standards are consistent with and not more stringent than standards developed pursuant to chapter 2, article 3 of this title, or if the standards are adopted pursuant to article 9 of this chapter. In administering this subsection, the department shall ensure that any discretion allowed to a director of an approved state pursuant to the federal regulations is maintained in the department's rules. Aquifer protection provisions adopted pursuant to this subsection do not apply to an owner or operator of a solid waste facility if the owner or operator submits an administratively complete application for an aquifer protection permit pursuant to chapter 2, article 3 of this title before the date that the owner or operator is required to submit a solid waste facility plan.

D. The department shall adopt rules to define biohazardous medical waste and to regulate biohazardous medical waste and medical sharps to include all of the following:

1. A definition for biohazardous medical waste that includes wastes that contain material that is likely to transmit etiologic agents that have been shown to cause or contribute to increased human morbidity or mortality of epidemiologic significance. The department shall consult with the department of health services in making this determination.

2. Reasonably necessary rules regarding the storage, collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of biohazardous medical waste and medical sharps, beginning with the placement by the generator of the waste in containers for the purpose of waste collection. The department may require payment of a fee for the licensure of a transporter of biohazardous medical waste. After July 20, 2011, the department shall establish by rule a fee for the licensure of a transporter of biohazardous medical waste, including a maximum fee. As part of the rulemaking process, there must be public notice and comment and a review of the rule by the joint legislative budget committee. After September 30, 2013, the department shall not increase that fee by rule without specific statutory authority for the increase. The fees shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the solid waste fee fund established by section 49-881. In the case of self-hauling of waste by the generator, all storage facilities under the generator's control and all waste handling practices including storage, treatment and transportation shall be in accordance with these rules. The department shall also adopt reasonably necessary rules regarding the tracking of biohazardous medical waste and medical sharps.

E. The department may adopt reasonably necessary rules regarding the storage, collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of nonbiohazardous medical waste beginning with the placement by the generator of the waste in containers for the purpose of waste collection.

F. The department shall adopt rules for the application of sludge from a wastewater treatment facility to land for use as fertilizer or beneficial soil amendment. For the purposes of this subsection, "sludge" has the same meaning as sewage sludge as defined in 40 Code of Federal Regulations 2 in effect on January 1, 1998.

G. The department shall adopt rules regarding the storage, processing, treatment or disposal of solid waste at solid waste facilities that are identified in section 49-762.01. The rules shall allow the owner or operator to certify compliance with the department's statutes and rules instead of obtaining a solid waste facility plan approval. The rules shall provide that the applicant at its option may request approval of a solid waste facility plan rather than certifying compliance.

H. The department shall issue by rule best management practices for the classes of solid waste facilities set forth in section 49-762.02.

I. The department shall adopt reasonably necessary rules establishing minimum standards for storing, collecting, transporting, disposing and reclaiming solid waste, including garbage, trash, rubbish, manure and other objectionable wastes. These rules shall provide for inspecting premises, containers, processes, equipment and vehicles, and for abating as environmental nuisances any premises, containers, processes, equipment or vehicles that do not comply with the minimum standards of these rules. The rules adopted pursuant to this subsection do not apply to sites that are either regulated by section 49-762, 49-762.01 or 49-762.02 or exempted from the definition of solid waste facility in section 49-701 or from the definition of solid waste in section 49-701.01. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, rules adopted pursuant to this subsection shall apply to defining environmental nuisances pursuant to section 49-141.

#### Section 49-762.06. Changes to solid waste facilities and amended plans

A. The department shall adopt rules that establish the criteria to be used in determining the category type of a proposed change to a solid waste facility identified in section 49-762. The categories are as follows:

1. A type I change is an insignificant modification that does not require notification to the department. This includes changes to a facility that are not directly related to the physical management of solid waste or the replacement of equipment or structures with similar items.

2. A type II change is a minor modification that requires notification to the department. This includes changes to a facility that are directly related to the physical management of solid waste and that do not require detailed review by the department.

3. A type III change is a substantial change that does not require public notice. This includes changes that are significant, that require detailed review by the department and that are equally or more protective of the public health and environment, changes that are required by statute or regulation or other substantial changes that are not type IV changes.

4. A type IV change is a substantial change that requires public notice. This includes significant changes in the total storage, process, treatment or disposal capacity of the solid waste facility. A type IV change also includes a lateral expansion of an existing solid waste landfill or the addition of a process or a major piece of equipment for which the net effect of the change will be an increase in discharges.

B. Before implementation, the director shall approve a type III or type IV change to the design or operation of an approved solid waste facility identified in section 49-762.

C. The owner or operator of an approved solid waste facility identified in section 49-762 shall submit a notice of any type II, type III or type IV change to the director. The notice shall describe the purpose and scope of the proposed change and shall state what category of change is requested. The director shall make the final determination of the category of change that is requested and whether an amended facility plan shall be submitted for a type III or type IV change. The director may request that additional information be submitted to assist in making the determination.

D. The determination required by subsection C of this section shall be made within the time limits prescribed by this subsection. If the director fails to make a determination within those time limits, the proposed change shall be deemed to be a type II change and in accordance with the facility's approved plan and may be implemented by the owner or operator without further review by the department. The time limits prescribed by this subsection do not apply if the proposed change conflicts with or is inconsistent with the requirements of 40 C.F.R. part 257, subparts A and B or 40 C.F.R. part 258. The time limits are as follows:

1. Fifteen days for solid waste facilities that are not landfills.

2. Thirty days for landfills that are not municipal solid waste landfills.

3. Sixty days for municipal solid waste landfills.

E. If the director determines that the change is a type IV change that requires a public notice, within thirty days after receipt of the amended plan the director shall give public notice of the substantial change as prescribed by section 49-762.04, subsection A, paragraph 2.

G. For a local governmental agency with CCR units, the demonstration required by this section may contain the details of the financial arrangements used to meet the estimated closure and postclosure costs without specifying a specific financial assurance mechanism.

#### Section 49-771. Restrictive covenants for solid waste landfills

A. The director may grant plan approval for operation of a solid waste landfill only if a restrictive covenant has been placed on the disposal area of the facility. An existing solid waste landfill for which a restrictive covenant is executed before July 1, 1998 is deemed to have satisfied this requirement. The director and all of the owners of the tract of land on which the solid waste landfill is located shall execute the restrictive covenant. A certified copy of the recorded covenant shall be submitted to the director within sixty days after execution. If the director does not receive the copy within sixty days, the director shall send written notice indicating the deficiency to the owners of the real property. If a certified copy of the recorded covenant is not received within thirty days of that written notice, the plan is deemed void.

B. The owner of the tract of land on which the solid waste landfill is or will be located shall record the instrument imposing the restrictive covenant in the county recorder's office in the county in which the solid waste landfill is located. If the director does not grant plan approval for operation of a solid waste landfill or the application for plan approval is withdrawn, and the tract of land was not used as a solid waste landfill, the owner and the director shall revoke the restrictive covenant.

C. The restrictive covenant shall state that the land described in the covenant has been or will be used as a solid waste landfill and that the property owners, their agents or employees or any of their heirs, successors, lessees or assignees shall not engage in development on or in filling, grading, excavating, drilling or mining of the solid waste landfill after closure without the approval of the director unless provided for in the approved facility closure or postclosure plan. In making this determination the director shall consider factors such as the original design, type of operation, material deposited, energy recovery from methane gas and stage of decomposition of the disposal area. The director shall not make any such determination if it will increase the potential for threat to public health and the environment.

D. The director may waive the restrictive covenant prescribed by this section if the land is federal land or if a contract that exists between the landowner and the lessee on October 9, 1993 does not allow the lessee to place an encumbrance on the disposal area.

In the case of an action pursuant to this section, the guarantor may invoke all rights and defenses which would have been available to the owner or operator against the claimant if an action had been brought against the owner or operator by the claimant and which would have been available to the guarantor if an action had been brought against the guarantor by the owner or operator.

B. The total liability of any guarantor is limited to the aggregate amount which the guarantor provides to the owner or operator as evidence of financial responsibility and which the owner or operator provides to the department pursuant to section 49-1006.

C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit any other state or federal statutory, contractual or common law liability of a guarantor to its owner or operator including, but not limited to, the liability of a guarantor for bad faith either in negotiating or in failing to negotiate the settlement of a claim.

D. Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish the liability of a person under the comprehensive environmental response, compensation, and liability act of 1980 (P.L. 96-510; 94 Stat. 2769; 42 United States Code sections 9607 or 9611) or other applicable law.

#### Section 49-1008. Closure

The temporary closure, permanent closure and change in service of an underground storage tank shall be accomplished in a safe and secure manner which prevents releases of regulated substances. The director shall prescribe by rule standards for these activities. Any rules adopted pursuant to this section shall be consistent with the federal regulations in effect on the date on which the rules are adopted. Until the rules adopted pursuant to this section are in effect, a temporary closure, permanent closure or change in service shall be accomplished in a manner consistent with 40 Code of Federal Regulations parts 280.70 through 280.74.

E. Monies in the fund may not be used to implement the water quality assurance revolving fund program pursuant to chapter 2, article 5 of this title.

#### Section 49-1016. Responsibilities of owners and operators

A. Unless specifically indicated otherwise, the responsibilities of this chapter are imposed on the owner and the operator of an underground storage tank.  If the owner and operator of an underground storage tank are separate persons, only one person is required to discharge any specific responsibility.  Both persons are liable in the event of noncompliance.

B. The liabilities and responsibilities for releases of regulated substances imposed pursuant to this chapter shall apply even if the conduct that resulted in the release or the release itself occurred before August 13, 1986.

C. If a person comes into the possession or control of property where an underground storage tank is located and the person is not the owner as defined in section 49-1001.01, the person shall:

1. Notify the department in writing specifying the tank's location, size and use, if known, if the owner has failed to do so.

2. Notify the department of each release or suspected release from the tank as soon as practicable if the owner or operator has failed to do so.

3. If the person voluntarily undertakes to remove or otherwise close the tank, do so in a safe and secure manner which prevents releases of regulated substances and in accordance with standards prescribed by the director pursuant to section 49-1008, except for the requirement to perform corrective action.

4. If the person voluntarily undertakes corrective action, take corrective action in a manner consistent with federal regulations and rules adopted by the director pursuant to section 49-1005.

D. A person acting under subsection C of this section shall not incur the liability of an owner.

E. No agreement or conveyance shall be effective to transfer the obligations imposed by this chapter from the owner or operator of any underground storage tank, or from any person who may be liable for a release or threat of release under this chapter, to any other person. Nothing in this section shall bar any agreement to insure, hold harmless, or indemnify a party to such agreement for any liability under this chapter nor shall it bar a cause of action that an owner or operator or any other person has or would have against any person.

F. In any action brought by the department under section 49-1013, the state bears the burden of establishing that an owner or operator has violated the requirements of this chapter.  An owner or operator is responsible for only the owner's or operator's contribution to any contamination that creates liability under this chapter.  No party bears the burden of proving any person's contribution to the contamination in any informal or formal appeal pursuant to section 49-1017, subsection D, section 49-1019, subsection D or section 49-1091.

G. If there is prima facie evidence that other identified or unidentified persons not at the owner's or operator's facility have contributed to the contamination, the owner or operator shall be responsible to take corrective action only to the extent, by area, of the owner's or operator's release.  The owner or operator shall not be required to identify or to prove the contribution of any contributing persons in order to limit the owner's or operator's own liability, but the owner or operator shall provide to the department any information the owner or operator knows regarding the identity or contribution of any other contributing persons.  If the owner or operator does not disclose the information prior to the owner's or operator's formal appeal of a decision by the department, upon the department's request, the administrative hearing shall be continued for no more than thirty days from the scheduled hearing date.  If who contributed to the contamination cannot be determined by a preponderance of evidence, or if an allocation for some or all of the contamination cannot be established by a preponderance of evidence, the liability that is not established to be the owner's or operator's by a preponderance of the evidence shall not be allocated to the owner or operator.

H. The department may issue a written interim decision or determination compelling owners and operators to allocate liability in accordance with section 49-1019, subsection D if either of the following conditions are met:

1. The owners and operators agree that no other owners or operators are liable for the contamination.

2. The contamination is from a single underground storage tank facility.

#### Section 49-1017. Powers of director; corrective actions

A. The director may take corrective action with respect to a release of a regulated substance that is petroleum into the environment from an underground storage tank if the director determines that action is necessary to protect human health, safety or the environment and any of the following conditions exist:

1. The department cannot locate, within ninety days or a shorter period necessary to protect human health or the environment, a person who is all of the following:

(a) An owner or operator of the tank concerned.

(b) Subject to the corrective action requirements of section 49-1005.

(c) Financially or technically capable of properly carrying out the corrective action required by section 49-1005. If the owner or operator and the department jointly determine that the owner or operator is not financially or technically able to carry out the corrective action, the department and the owner may enter into a contract under which the department acts as manager of the corrective action on behalf of the owner or operator. The existence of a management contract with the department does not relieve the owner of any liability for costs that are not payable by the department under this chapter.

2. Corrective action costs at a facility exceed the amount of coverage required by section 49-1006 and expenditures from the underground storage tank revolving fund are necessary to ensure effective corrective action.

B. In determining whether to take a corrective action pursuant to subsection A of this section, the director shall consider and make written findings regarding all of the following factors:

1. The physical and chemical characteristics of the type of petroleum released, including its toxicity, persistence and potential for migration.

2. The hydrogeologic characteristics of the site where the underground storage tank is located and the surrounding area.

3. The proximity, quality and current and future uses of nearby surface water and groundwater.

4. The potential effects of residual contamination on nearby surface water and groundwater.

5. The degree of exposure.

6. The need for financial assistance.

C. If direct costs are incurred by the director for undertaking corrective action with respect to a release of a regulated substance that is petroleum, the owner and operator are liable to this state for these direct costs.  Liability imposed pursuant to this subsection is strict.  For the purposes of this subsection, "direct costs" means the cost of the corrective actions, investigations, enforcement and litigation except for those amounts that are not allocated to the owner or operator pursuant to subsection D of this section.

D. If there is more than one responsible person, liability under this section shall be equitably allocated on a case-by-case basis according to section 49-1016, subsection F, and using the following factors as those factors are appropriate under the circumstances:

1. The duration and percentage of ownership or operation of the underground storage tank during a release of regulated substances from the tank.

2. The amount and nature of the regulated substances released.

3. The degree of care exercised by each person with respect to the regulated substances released.

4. The ability to distinguish between the respective releases of more than one responsible person.

5. Other factors that are appropriate under the circumstances.

E. The allocation of liability under this section shall be promptly determined by one or more mediators who shall be selected by the responsible persons within sixty days after the responsible persons are identified by the director.  The director may select a mediator and convene a mediation on the failure of the responsible persons to select one or more mediators. The mediator shall not have a conflict of interest with the responsible persons. A mediation convened by the director shall be held within sixty days after the mediator being selected. The director shall provide notice to the responsible persons of the time and place for the mediation and the name of the mediator or mediators.  This notice shall be provided at least forty-five days prior to the date scheduled for mediation.  Costs of mediation shall be eligible for payment and shall be allocated to participants in the mediation in the same proportion as the costs of corrective action.  Nothing in this section shall excuse the obligations of an owner or operator to take timely and adequate action in response to a release of regulated substances as required in this chapter.  Nothing in this section shall diminish the right of any person to bring an action against any other person as provided in section 49-1019 for contribution or reimbursement for the reasonable costs of corrective action that person has been allocated pursuant to this section.

F. The director may take a corrective action with respect to a release of a regulated substance that is not petroleum only as a remedial action subject to chapter 2, article 5 of this title, and the rules adopted pursuant to that article.  If the director takes a corrective action for the release of a regulated substance that is not petroleum, all of the rights, duties and responsibilities of a person associated with the release shall be determined pursuant to that article.

G. An owner, operator or other person that meets the requirements of section 49-1016, subsection C may request that the department conduct corrective action under this section. Subject to the availability of monies allocated and the priority assigned to the site pursuant to subsection B of this section, the department may conduct the corrective action.

H. A request for corrective action pursuant to subsection G of this section shall be on a form provided by the department and shall contain sufficient information related to the site and the factors prescribed in subsection B of this section to allow the director to make a determination of priority for that request.

 

#### Section 49-1017.01. Settlement authority; participation; financial information; process; payment; notice

A. The director shall consider any offer by an owner or operator who is potentially liable for direct costs incurred by the director pursuant to section 49-1017, subsection C, without regard to the extent of that owner's or operator's liability, if the owner or operator is unable to pay for the direct costs. An owner or operator whose liability for direct costs arose from a criminal act is not eligible to enter into a settlement agreement pursuant to this section. An owner's or operator's decision to enter into a settlement agreement pursuant to this section is not an admission in a judicial proceeding as to the fact or extent of that owner's or operator's liability with respect to releases or threatened releases that are covered by the settlement. An owner or operator who is a party to a settlement pursuant to this section is not required to participate in allocation proceedings pursuant to section 49-1017, subsections D and E.  Any settlement approved by the department does not release the owner or operator from any responsibility or duty imposed pursuant to this chapter other than liability for direct costs incurred pursuant to section 49-1017, subsection C.

B. Any settlement approved by the department does not increase the liability of any other owner or operator pursuant to this chapter and does not create any liability for the department or this state.

C. The director shall consider all of the following factors in considering an owner's or operator's ability to pay for the direct costs:

1. The financial resources of the owner or operator, including available financial assurance mechanisms other than the underground storage tank revolving fund.

2. The amount of coverage available to the owner or operator from the underground storage tank revolving fund for the direct costs. As a condition of settlement, the owner or operator shall apply to the underground storage tank revolving fund and any applicable grant program for coverage of the direct costs before requesting settlement pursuant to this section.

3. The owner's or operator's ability to continue in business after payment of the owner's or operator's liability for direct costs as defined in section 49-1017, subsection C.

4. Whether payment of the owner's or operator's liability for direct costs as defined in section 49-1017, subsection C would require the owner or operator to seek protection under the federal bankruptcy law or render the owner or operator insolvent.

5. The financial resources of all concerns in which the owner or operator maintains ownership, control or management.

D. An owner or operator seeking settlement pursuant to subsection A of this section shall submit a letter requesting a financial hardship settlement and shall include the owner's or operator's tax returns and all schedules, financial statements, balance statements and other information concerning the owner's or operator's gross income and net worth for the five years immediately preceding the date of the application. Within ninety days after the receipt of the application, the director may require additional information to verify the owner's or operator's eligibility for settlement pursuant to subsection A of this section. The owner or operator may provide any additional information the owner or operator believes to be relevant to the application. The director shall keep confidential any financial information submitted by the owner or operator pursuant to this subsection. If the director or the attorney general disputes a claim of confidentiality, the director or the attorney general shall provide written notice that the claim is disputed to the owner or operator claiming the confidentiality. The information shall be made available to the public if the owner or operator claiming confidentiality does not file an action for declaratory relief in superior court within thirty days after receiving the notice.

E. The owner or operator shall cooperate with the director in providing reasonable access and information for the director to carry out the requirements of this section as a condition of the settlement.

F. If the director verifies that the owner or operator is unable to pay the direct costs incurred by the director pursuant to section 49-1017, subsection C, the director shall enter into a settlement within ninety days after receipt of the application and any other information required pursuant to this section. The director shall allow the settlement amount to be paid over a period of time that does not exceed ten years.  Settlement payments over a period of time are subject to the payment of interest at the rate of six percent a year, except that payments are not subject to interest if the entire settlement amount is paid within five years. The owner or operator may file a petition with the director to modify the payment schedule on a showing of good cause that the payment schedule cannot be met.

G. The director may require that notice of the terms of the settlement agreement be provided to the public to allow for comment for a period of thirty days before the department enters into a settlement agreement. Any interested person may comment on the settlement agreement in writing to the director. The director may withdraw from a settlement agreement after considering the comments.

H. If the director determines that the owner or operator does not qualify for a settlement pursuant to this section, the director shall notify the owner or operator in writing within ninety days after the receipt of all information required pursuant to this section stating the reasons for ineligibility. The application for settlement is deemed denied if the director does not notify the owner or operator within ninety days after the director's receipt of all applicable information. A denial of a settlement application under this subsection constitutes an appealable agency action as defined in section 41-1092. In any administrative appeal hearing conducted pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10, the documents submitted by the owner or operator pursuant to this section are not confidential. Any appeal is limited to the owner's or operator's eligibility for a financial hardship settlement pursuant to this section and the owner's or operator's ability to pay the direct costs incurred by the director pursuant to section 49-1017, subsection C.

 

#### Section 49-1017.02. Powers of the director; noncorrective actions

A. Subject to the availability of monies in the underground storage tank revolving fund that are allocated by the director, an owner, an operator or another person that meets the requirements of section 49-1016, subsection C may request that the department conduct one or more of the following noncorrective actions at a site:

1. Obtaining a baseline assessment of a tank or site as prescribed in section 49-1052.

2. Confirmation of a suspected release at a tank or site.

3. Permanent closure of an underground storage tank as prescribed by section 49-1008.

B. In determining the priority for requests under subsection A of this section, the director may consider the following factors:

1. The age, construction and operational history of the underground storage tank at the site.

2. The hydrogeologic characteristics of the site where the underground storage tank is located and the surrounding area.

3. The proximity, quality and current and future uses of nearby surface water and groundwater.

4. The potential effects of residual contamination to nearby surface water and groundwater.

5. The degree of exposure, including the physical and chemical characteristics of the type of petroleum sold or suspected to have been released, including its toxicity, persistence and potential for migration.

6. The financial ability of the person to conduct the action with the person's own monies.

C. A request for a noncorrective action under this section shall be on a form provided by the department and shall contain sufficient information related to the site and the factors prescribed in subsection B of this section to allow the director to make a determination of priority for that request.

 

#### Section 49-1018. Corrective action; enforcement; priority

The director shall give priority in undertaking state-led corrective actions pursuant to section 49-1017 to releases of regulated substances from underground storage tanks that pose the greatest threat to human health and the environment and shall consider the degree to which financial assistance from the department is necessary to ensure that corrective actions will be conducted.

 

#### Section 49-1019. Release of regulated substance; causes of action; limitation; liability

A. Any one of the following persons may bring an action in superior court against a person who caused or contributed to the release of a regulated substance from an underground storage tank to require that person to reimburse one of the following persons for the reasonable costs of corrective actions taken in response to the release:

1. An owner or operator of an underground storage tank or any other person who takes a corrective action pursuant to section 49-1005.

2. An owner or operator of an underground storage tank or any other person from whom costs are recovered by this state pursuant to this chapter.

B. The person seeking reimbursement has the burden of demonstrating that the corrective action costs incurred were reasonable.

C. This article does not affect or modify the obligations or liability of a person, by reason of subrogation or otherwise, under any other provision of common law, federal law or the laws of this state, for damages, injury or loss resulting from a release of a regulated substance or for the costs of a corrective action, except that a person who receives compensation for the costs of a corrective action pursuant to this article is precluded from recovering compensation for the same corrective action costs pursuant to any other federal law or the laws of this state. A person who receives compensation for corrective action costs pursuant to federal law or the laws of this state is precluded from receiving compensation for the same corrective action costs as provided in this article.

D. Liability under this section shall be equitably allocated on a case-by-case basis in accordance with section 49-1017, subsection D. Any party authorized to bring an action pursuant to subsection A of this section and any party against whom an action is brought may have liability allocated through mediation in accordance with section 49-1017, subsection D or through the informal appeal process in accordance with section 49-1091.

E. The department may take corrective action for a release and recover direct costs pursuant to section 49-1017 in proportion to the allocation made pursuant to subsection D of this section if an owner or an operator does not perform all necessary corrective actions and there is no other person to perform corrective actions pursuant to section 49-1016, subsection C.

 

#### Section 49-1020. Fees

Each owner and operator of an underground storage tank that is subject to regulation under this chapter shall pay annually to the department a fee of one hundred dollars for each tank.  An owner or operator who sold or relinquished legal, equitable or possessory interest in the property on or before January 1, 1990 shall not be responsible to pay the fee prescribed by this section. The director, with the approval of the attorney general, may abate fee balances if the administration costs exceed the amount of the fees due.  The fees collected under this section shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the underground storage tank revolving fund established by section 49-1015. The director shall adopt rules to provide for the orderly imposition and collection of the fees imposed by this section.

 

#### Section 49-1021. Applicability

Until rules adopted pursuant to this chapter are in effect, this chapter shall apply only to the extent described by 40 Code of Federal Regulations 10 and the energy policy act. Rules adopted pursuant to this chapter shall apply only to underground storage tanks not excluded or deferred by the federal regulations in effect on the date on which the rules are adopted.

 

#### Section 49-1022. Regulated substance migration off site; responsibility; corrective action; notice; appeal; coverage

A. The director may undertake corrective action in response to a release from an underground storage tank that migrates on or under a person's property as the result of an occurrence at another property or that the department determines is likely to migrate on or under a person's property, if all of the following occur:

1. The person has authority to allow access to the property so that corrective action may be taken on the person's property.

2. The owner or operator of the underground storage tank that is the source of the release makes a written request that the department attempt to obtain access to the property. As part of the written request, the owner or operator shall demonstrate to the department the following before the department attempts to obtain access to the property:

(a) The owner or operator has sent and the person has received at least two written requests to allow the owner or operator to have access to the property at reasonable times and under reasonable conditions.

(b) The owner or operator has made an offer of reasonable compensation to the person.

(c) Contamination is likely to spread or increase in severity if access to the property is not obtained.

3. The person has received a written request from the department to have access to the property, at reasonable times and under reasonable conditions in a manner that does not constitute a taking as provided by law, to take corrective action with respect to only the release that has migrated on that person's property.

4. The person has refused to allow the owner or operator or the department to have access to the property or does not respond to the department within sixty days after receiving the request for access.

B. The department shall issue a notice describing the proposed corrective action to the owner or operator and the person on whose property the department will undertake corrective action if it elects to undertake corrective action pursuant to subsection A of this section. The owner or operator or the person on whose property the department undertakes corrective action may appeal pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10, within thirty days after the notice or within thirty days after the performance of the corrective action. If, after an appeal, it is determined that the department failed to return the property to substantially the same condition the property was in before being accessed, the person on whose property the department undertakes the corrective action may be eligible for payment from the underground storage tank revolving fund only to the extent the department failed to return the property to substantially the same condition the property was in before being accessed.

C. The owner or operator shall reimburse the department for any costs paid from the underground storage tank revolving fund pursuant to this section.

D. The department shall promptly provide to a person whose property is accessed under this section a copy of the results of any analysis of the soil or groundwater relating to the accessed property arising from the department's access or corrective action undertaken at the property. The department shall not sue the person for any secondary contamination created by the access or corrective action.

E. If a release of a regulated substance has migrated on or under a person's property, the department shall relieve the owner or operator of the underground storage tank from responsibility from performing corrective action at the property where the release has migrated or where the department has determined it is likely to have migrated, if the owner or operator is unable to gain access to the property after complying with subsection A, paragraph 2, subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section. Nothing in this section relieves the owner or operator from liability for completing the requirements of section 49-1005 relating to the owner's or operator's property or any other property to which the contamination may have migrated. The department may require that the owner or operator investigate any other properties potentially impacted by the release in order to complete the requirements of section 49-1005.

### Article 2 - Underground Storage Tank Tax

#### Section 49-1031. Imposition of tax

A. From and after July 1, 1990, there is imposed and the director shall collect an excise tax on the operation of underground storage tanks regulated under this chapter measured by the quantity of regulated substances placed in a tank in any calendar year. The tax is levied at the rate of one cent per gallon of regulated substance.

B. For proper administration of this article, and to prevent the evasion of the tax imposed by this article, it shall be presumed until the contrary is established by competent proof under rules and procedures adopted by the director that all regulated substances that are motor vehicle fuel as defined in section 28-101, aviation fuel as defined in section 28-101 and diesel as defined in section 28-6001, subsection B and that are refined, manufactured, produced, compounded or blended in this state, or imported into this state, will be placed in an underground storage tank from which the fuel is dispensed to users who consume the fuel and do not further distribute it. Under this presumption, the owner and operator of an underground storage tank from which motor vehicle fuel, aviation fuel or diesel is dispensed and from which no further bulk distribution will be made, shall be considered to have paid the tax collected under title 28, chapter 16, article 6.

C. The tax imposed by this article does not apply to underground storage tanks operated by the United States or this state or agencies of the United States or this state or to any of the following substances placed in underground storage tanks:

1. Naphtha-type jet fuel or kerosene-type jet fuel.

2. Regulated substances as defined in section 49-1001, paragraph 16, subdivision (b), unless such regulated substances were placed in an underground storage tank prior to July 1, 1997, and the owner or operator of the underground storage tank has paid prior to July 1, 1997 all taxes imposed by this article applicable to such regulated substances. If the owner or operator has paid those taxes, the owner or operator may elect to continue to pay the tax imposed by this article regarding such regulated substances.

D. The owner and operator of an underground storage tank regulated under this chapter are jointly and severally liable for the tax, but the owner and operator may agree between themselves and file a notarized affidavit with the director designating either the owner or operator as primarily responsible for the tax under this article.

E. Any person who purchases motor vehicle fuel as defined in section 28-101, aviation fuel as defined in section 28-101, or diesel as defined in section 28-6001, subsection B for which the tax imposed by this section has been paid and which fuel has been placed in a tank which is not subject to the underground storage tank tax imposed by this section and from which no further bulk distribution of the fuel will be made, may claim a refund of the tax levied. Refunds shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the director and shall be supported by substantiation for the amount of the tax paid.

F. Any person eligible to claim a refund of the tax imposed by this section, including an assignee of a refund claim, may assign such claim to the person from whom the fuel was purchased, and the assignee of the claim may claim the refund allowed under subsection E of this section provided that the assignor of the claim certifies in writing to the assignee, on forms prescribed by the director, that the assignor relinquishes all interest in the refund and shall not also claim a refund from the director.

G. If a refund claim is assigned to a person who is required to make payments under title 28, chapter 16, article 6, the refund shall be taken into account in the manner provided in section 28-6005.

H. The director shall adopt temporary and permanent rules for administering the tax imposed by this article and specifying the forms of the return and of the certification provided for in sections 28-6003 and 28-6004. The temporary and permanent rules shall prescribe the forms for and manner in which refunds may be claimed and refund claims assigned pursuant to subsection F of this section, shall specify the circumstances in which fuel may be excluded from the quantity of fuel used to measure the tax pursuant to title 28, chapter 16, article 6, and shall prescribe the forms for and manner which the certification provided in title 28, chapter 16, article 6 shall be made.

I. Title 41, chapter 6 shall not apply to the temporary rules adopted pursuant to this section. The temporary rules shall be filed with the secretary of state and shall be effective for a period of one hundred eighty days after the date of filing with the secretary of state. The temporary rules may be renewed twice in the same manner as they were adopted, may be amended at the time or times they are renewed, and shall be effective for a period of one hundred eighty days after the date the renewed temporary rules are filed with the secretary of state.

J. The permanent rules adopted pursuant to this section shall be adopted as provided in title 41, chapter 6.

 

#### Section 49-1031.01. Underground storage tank excise tax; legislative review

A. The tax levied under this article is due and payable annually on or before March 31 for the preceding calendar year and is delinquent if not postmarked on or before that date or if not received by the department on or before March 31 for taxpayers electing to file in person.

B. At the time the tax is paid the taxpayer shall prepare and file with the tax a return, on a form prescribed by the director, showing the amount of tax for which he is liable for the period covered by the return. The return shall contain either a sworn statement or a certification, under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in the return is true, complete and correct according to the best belief and knowledge of the owner or operator filing the report.

 

#### Section 49-1033. Extensions; abatement

A. The director, for good cause, may extend the time for making any return required by this article and may grant such reasonable additional time within which to make the return as he deems proper if at least ninety per cent of the tax liability is paid when the extension is requested.

B. The director, with the approval of the attorney general, may abate small tax balances if the administration costs exceed the amount of tax due.

#### Section 49-1034. Audits

The director may require a person who is required to pay the tax under this article to appear, at reasonable times and on reasonable notice, at the director's office and produce such records and information as are specified in the notice to determine compliance with this article. The director shall audit the records of a sufficient number of taxpayers under this section to ensure general compliance with this article.

 

#### Section 49-1035. Interest; penalty; lien

If the tax, or any portion of the tax, is not paid on or before the date prescribed for its payment, the director shall collect, as part of the tax, interest on the unpaid amount at the rate determined pursuant to section 42-1123 from the date prescribed for payment until the full amount is paid.

B. If a taxpayer fails to make and file a return as required under this article on or before the due date as extended by the director, unless the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect, a penalty of five per cent of the tax found to be remaining due shall be added to the tax for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due date of the return and the date on which it is filed. The total penalty shall not exceed twenty-five per cent of the tax remaining due. The penalty so added to the tax is due and payable on notice and demand by the director.

C. If any tax, interest or penalty imposed by this article is not paid when due, the unpaid amounts are a lien from the date the amounts became due on all real and personal property and rights to property belonging to the taxpayer. The lien may be perfected by recording a notice of lien in the county in which the property is located. The notice shall specify the nature of the tax, the amount of tax, interest and penalty due, the taxable period for which the amounts are due and the name and last known address of the taxpayer who is liable for the amounts.

#### Section 49-1036. Remission and disposition of revenues

The director shall promptly deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, all monies collected under this article and shall credit these payments to the underground storage tank revolving fund.

 

### Article 3 - Underground Storage Tank Revolving Fund Payment Process

#### Section 49-1051. Preapproval process; requirements; corrective action priority

A. An owner, an operator or the designated representative of the owner or operator must follow the preapproval process pursuant to this section to be eligible for reimbursement from the underground storage tank revolving fund for corrective actions taken pursuant to section 49-1053, subsection A. Preapproval applications must include a detailed scope of work that conforms to the requirements of sections 49-1005 and 49-1053, a schedule for conducting corrective actions and a cost sheet. Beginning January 1, 2016 and except as prescribed in subsection J of this section, corrective actions and costs for activities that were completed before departmental approval of the scope of work are not eligible for reimbursement under section 49-1054. If the preapproved scope of work cannot be implemented as approved, the person seeking reimbursement shall submit a change notice to the department. To be eligible for reimbursement, a change notice must be approved by the department before implementation of the change notice.

B. This section does not relieve an owner, an operator or the designated representative of the owner or operator from any of the requirements of this chapter.

C. While the application for preapproval is pending, the department may not take enforcement action or impose penalties against the owner, operator or designated representative who submitted the application for preapproval. The department may not consider the passage of time while the preapproval application is pending to be a basis for taking an enforcement action. For any corrective action submitted for preapproval pursuant to rule, the period of time for compliance with corrective actions associated with that preapproval begins to run after the date of preapproval of the corrective action.

D. On determination by the department or its designated contractor that the application for preapproval is complete, the department or its designated contractor shall determine whether the owner or operator was a small owner at the time of the application. For the purposes of this subsection, "small owner" means an owner that owns fewer than twenty underground storage tank facilities in this state.

E. In processing the application for preapproval, the department shall determine the corrective action priority of the release within ninety days after the receipt of the materials required by this section.  The corrective action priority shall be based on all of the following:

1. The need for financial assistance, including the availability of coverage under insurance or other financial assurance mechanisms.

2. The extent to which a delay in reimbursement will affect the ability to conduct corrective actions.

3. The risk to human health and the environment.

4. The presence of preexisting contamination of groundwater by a hazardous substance as defined in section 49-281.

F. An owner or operator may request reimbursement under section 49-1053.  Subject to the availability of monies allocated and the assigned priority of the site pursuant to subsection E of this section, the department may make reimbursements from the underground storage tank revolving fund.

G. An application for preapproval and reimbursement pursuant to this section shall be on a form provided by the department and shall contain sufficient information to allow the director to make a determination of priority for that request.

H. Any determination made by the department pursuant to this section constitutes a written interim determination relating to preapproval pursuant to section 49-1091.

I. The department may alter the corrective action priority of the release at any time based on the results of sampling and monitoring conducted pursuant to this section or any other information obtained by the department.

J. Corrective actions and costs for activities that were completed before the department's approval of the scope of work are eligible for reimbursement under section 49-1054 if the applicant otherwise complies with subsection A of this section and any of the following applies:

1. For corrective actions and costs for activities that are completed from and after December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2019 and that are not the subject of a preapproval or reimbursement under time-barred claims provisions because the applicant's financial responsibility mechanism was defective at the time of the release or the release occurred before financial responsibility was in place, the applicant is eligible for reimbursement for those corrective actions and costs for activities that are incurred from and after the date the applicant demonstrates to the department that the applicant is in compliance with financial responsibility requirements and the financial responsibility is demonstrated to the department before January 1, 2019.  From and after December 31, 2018, the applicant is only eligible for reimbursement for corrective actions and costs incurred in response to releases confirmed after the date the applicant has demonstrated compliance with financial responsibility requirements.

2. For corrective actions and costs for activities completed from and after December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2019, and for which the applicant's compliance with the preapproval process was impracticable due to:

(a) The urgency of the corrective action to address newly discovered contamination.

(b) The need for corrective action to avoid risk to public health and the environment.

3. For corrective actions and costs for activities completed from and after December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2019, the corrective actions and costs are not the subject of a time-barred claim or were not otherwise reimbursed by the department.

4. Only for corrective actions and costs of activities completed before January 1, 2020, the claim for reimbursement is received by the department before January 1, 2021 and paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of this subsection applies.

K. The department shall develop an expedited preapproval process not later than December 31, 2019 to address those corrective action costs incurred for newly discovered contamination and to address those corrective action costs necessary to avoid risk to public health and the environment.

L. Direct costs incurred by the department in conducting corrective action pursuant to section 49-1017 that are in excess of the coverage limits applicable to time-barred claims as otherwise provided by law shall reduce the amount otherwise payable to an owner or operator pursuant to section 49-1054 but any amount remaining under section 49-1054 shall be available to the owner or operator for additional corrective action costs.

M. For direct costs incurred by the department in conducting corrective action pursuant to section 49-1017 after December 31, 2016, the owner or operator is liable to the department for any amount incurred except for the amount that is eligible and within the amount allowable under section 49-1054.

C. Baseline assessments shall be conducted under the direction of a person who is a professional engineer or a registered geologist who is registered under title 32, chapter 1 or a remediation specialist.

D. The scope of the baseline assessment shall address likely release areas and shall include a collection of sufficient information to allow for a determination of the current environmental condition of the property.  Samples shall be collected in areas where contamination is most likely to have occurred and sample locations shall consider site-specific conditions, location of potential receptors and preexisting contamination.  The baseline assessment must include the registered or certified professional's interpretation regarding confirmation of an unknown release and evaluation of potential risk for the purpose of prioritizing corrective actions.

E. If unknown contamination is identified in the baseline assessment, all of the following apply:

1. The owner, operator or person that meets the requirements of section 49-1016, subsection C shall comply with the reporting requirements pursuant to section 49-1004 and shall initiate corrective actions pursuant to section 49-1005.

2. Unless documentation is provided to the department that demonstrates that the operating underground storage tank is not the source of the release, the department shall require tightness testing.

3. If continued operation of the underground storage tank may result in a continued release, the department may initiate delivery prohibition as prescribed in section 49-1023.

#### Section 49-1053. Reimbursement of corrective action costs; definition

A. The department may provide reimbursement from the underground storage tank revolving fund under the preapproval process prescribed in section 49-1051 in the amounts authorized by section 49-1054 of the costs incurred for the following:

4. Preparation of the initial approved preapproval application and the consulting expenses incurred in participating in the initial preapproval meeting but not more than two percent of the amount incurred for the project cost in the first year.  Costs must be submitted in the first reimbursement request for corrective actions that is submitted pursuant to section 49-1054.

B. The department may provide the reimbursement required by this section either by paying the owner, the operator or a designated representative of the owner or operator or any combination of these persons or a political subdivision pursuant to subsection F of this section. If the department determines that an application for reimbursement is incomplete, the department within forty-five days after receiving the application shall notify the applicant of the missing information as specifically as possible and shall allow the applicant to provide the additional information within thirty days. On the request of an applicant, the department shall grant an additional sixty days to submit the missing information. The grant of additional time tolls the period for making an interim determination on matters relating to reimbursement pursuant to section 49-1091.

C. The department may not pay for eligible costs unless the department determines that the eligible activities have met, or when completed will meet, the applicable requirements of section 49-1004 or 49-1005. The department may require by rule that persons that perform payable eligible activities meet specified standards of qualification and be approved by the department.

D. The department may not provide any reimbursement described in this article to an owner or operator of underground storage tanks described in section 49-1031, subsection C. The department may not provide any reimbursement described in this article with respect to the substances described in section 49-1031, subsection C, unless the tax imposed by article 2 of this chapter applies to such substances.

E. The department shall establish criteria for determining priorities among the applications from small owners for reimbursement under this article. For all other owners that are eligible for reimbursement from the fund through the cost sharing prescribed in section 49-1006.02, subsection B, priority shall be based on the date of completion of the work.  The criteria for small owners shall include:

1. The need for financial assistance.

2. The extent to which a delay in providing reimbursement will affect an eligible activity in progress.

3. The date on which an application for reimbursement is submitted to the department.

4. Whether the payment has been previously deferred because of insufficient monies in the underground storage tank revolving fund and, if deferred, the length of the deferral.

F. The department may provide the reimbursement described in this article for eligible activity costs incurred by a political subdivision with respect to a release from an underground storage tank if the underground storage tank or the property where the underground storage tank is located comes into the possession or control of the political subdivision under title 12, chapter 8, article 2 or 3.

G. Subject to section 38-503 and other applicable statutes and rules, the department may contract with a private consultant for the purpose of assisting the department in reviewing preapproval and reimbursement applications, site characterization reports, corrective action plans, monitoring reports and other information to determine whether corrective actions meet the criteria and requirements of this chapter and the rules adopted by the director.

H. Requests by the department for additional information from applicants shall be reasonably related to the determination of the validity of the claim as prescribed by this article.

I. Except for appeals costs authorized pursuant to section 49-1091.01, applications for reimbursement under a preapproved scope of work shall be submitted to the department not more than one year after the applicant receives a closure letter sent by the department by certified mail with notice that the applicant has one year to submit a claim for that release. Failure to submit a timely reimbursement request under a preapproved scope of work shall result in denial of the claim.  The time limit prescribed by this subsection does not apply to closed releases that are subsequently reopened for the performance of additional corrective actions or at which corrective actions are proceeding pursuant to a work plan for preapproval submitted before the release was closed.

J. The department may provide reimbursement under a preapproved scope of work for the reasonable, necessary, cost-effective and technically feasible costs of corrective actions relating to soil remediation that are consistent with remediation standards adopted pursuant to chapter 1, article 4 of this title or site-specific, risk-based levels as determined under rules adopted pursuant to this chapter. The department may provide reimbursement under a preapproved scope of work for the reasonable, necessary, cost-effective and technically feasible costs of corrective actions relating to groundwater remediation to predetermined standards or site-specific, risk-based levels as determined under rules adopted pursuant to this chapter. The department may provide reimbursement for corrective actions related to the control and removal of a source of contamination. A source of contamination includes any one or more of the following:

1. Free product.

2. A regulated substance present in soil that causes or threatens to cause an exceedance of the aquifer water quality standards.

3. A regulated substance present in groundwater at levels that would prevent timely reduction of contaminant concentrations in comparison with the performance of active remediation.

4. Any other presence of a regulated substance causing an ongoing source of contamination, as determined by the department.

K. On preapproval by the department or its designated contractor of corrective action costs for small owners, the department or its designated contractor shall encumber monies in the corrective action allocation for that year. If monies are available in the corrective action allocation for that year, reimbursement shall be made when the corrective action for which the monies were encumbered is completed as determined by the department or its designated contractor.

L. If there are insufficient monies to pay for approved corrective actions in any annual corrective action allocation, the department or its designated contractor may preapprove reimbursement of corrective action costs for an owner that is not a small owner without encumbering monies. If monies are available in the corrective action allocation for that year at the end of the corrective action allocation year, reimbursement may be based on the date the corrective action is completed as determined by the department or its designated contractor.

M. If there are insufficient monies to pay for approved corrective action in any annual corrective action allocation, the department shall reimburse the corrective action from the next annual corrective action allocation, with the priority that reimbursements first go to small owners.

N. The department may not accept an application to the underground storage tank revolving fund for reimbursement from an applicant for costs associated with a single facility more frequently than once each calendar month, and the department may not accept an application for costs associated with a single facility for an amount of less than $5,000 unless the reimbursement is the final application associated with the facility.

O. An application for reimbursement pursuant to this section shall be on a form provided by the department and shall contain sufficient information to allow the director to make a determination of priority for that request.

P. For the purposes of this section, "small owner" means an owner that owns fewer than twenty underground storage tank facilities in this state.

A. The department may provide reimbursement from the underground storage tank revolving fund for the reasonable and necessary costs of eligible activities pursuant to section 49-1053, subsection A for releases that are reported before the end of the baseline period established pursuant to section 49-1052. Receipt of financial assistance from the underground storage tank revolving fund does not constitute a financial assurance mechanism and may not be used to demonstrate compliance with financial responsibility requirements or to provide compensation to third parties for bodily injury or property damage. Reimbursement from the underground storage tank revolving fund to owners and operators may not exceed $1,000,000 per facility.

B. The department may compel the production of documents to determine the existence, amount and type of insurance or alternative coverage available. An owner or operator shall report to the department any payment of corrective actions costs through insurance and alternative financial assurance mechanisms.

C. The department may not disburse more than the maximum amounts prescribed by subsection A of this section from the underground storage tank revolving fund for corrective action costs associated with a facility.

D. The department shall pay eligible costs that are reasonable and were actually incurred for corrective actions that were actually performed. The costs for the corrective actions shall be submitted as prescribed in sections 49-1051 and 49-1053.  The department shall pay only for corrective actions that have been completed and that have been conducted pursuant to the preapproval approved by the department. Reasonableness of corrective actions shall be determined based on the law and the facts available to the owner or operator at the time the technical decision was made. The department shall establish schedules of corrective action costs that the department considers reasonable.
