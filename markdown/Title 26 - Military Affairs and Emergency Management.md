## Chapter 3 - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT

### Article 1 - General Provisions

#### Section 26-401. Title

This act may be cited as the emergency management assistance compact.

 

#### Section 26-402. Compact

The legislature of the state of Arizona hereby authorizes the governor of the state of Arizona to enter into a compact on behalf of the state of Arizona with any other state legally joining therein, in the form substantially as follows:

EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT ASSISTANCE COMPACT

ARTICLE I &#822; GENERAL PROVISIONS

This compact is made and entered into by and between the participating member states which enact this compact, hereinafter called party states.  For the purposes of this agreement, the term "states" is taken to mean the several states, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia and all U.S. territorial possessions.

The purpose of this compact is to provide for mutual assistance between the states entering into this compact in managing any emergency or disaster that is duly declared by the governor of the affected state, whether arising from natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, civil emergency aspects of resources shortages, community disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.

This compact shall also provide for mutual cooperation in emergency-related exercises, testing or other training activities using equipment and personnel simulating performance of any aspect of the giving and receiving of aid by party states or subdivisions of party states during emergencies, such actions occurring outside actual declared emergency periods. Mutual assistance in this compact may include the use of the states' national guard forces, either in accordance with the national guard mutual assistance compact or by mutual agreement between states.

ARTICLE II &#822; GENERAL IMPLEMENTATION

Each party state entering into this compact recognizes many emergencies transcend political jurisdictional boundaries and that intergovernmental coordination is essential in managing these and other emergencies under this compact.  Each state further recognizes that there will be emergencies which require immediate access and present procedures to apply outside resources to make a prompt and effective response to such an emergency.  This is because few, if any, individual states have all the resources necessary for delivering services to areas where emergencies exist. The prompt, full and effective utilization of resources of the participating states, including any resources on hand or available from the federal government or any other source, that are essential to the safety, care and welfare of the people in the event of any emergency or disaster declared by a party state, shall be the underlying principle on which all articles of this compact shall be understood.

On behalf of the governor of each state participating in the compact, the legally designated state official who is assigned responsibility for emergency management will be responsible for formulation of the appropriate interstate mutual aid plans and procedures necessary to implement this compact.

ARTICLE III &#822; PARTY STATE RESPONSIBILITIES

A. It shall be the responsibility of each party state to formulate procedural plans and programs for interstate cooperation in the performance of the responsibilities listed in this article. In formulating such plans, and in carrying them out, the party states, insofar as practical, shall:

i. Review individual state hazards analyses and, to the extent reasonably possible, determine all those potential emergencies the party states might jointly suffer, whether due to natural disaster, technological hazard, man-made disaster, emergency aspects of resource shortages, civil disorders, insurgency or enemy attack.

ii. Review party states' individual emergency plans and develop a plan which will determine the mechanism for the interstate management and provision of assistance concerning any potential emergency.

iii. Develop interstate procedures to fill any identified gaps and to resolve any identified inconsistencies or overlaps in existing or developed plans.

iv. Assist in warning communities adjacent to or crossing the state boundaries.

v. Protect and assure uninterrupted delivery of services, medicines, water, food, energy and fuel, search and rescue, and critical lifeline equipment, services and resources, both human and material.

vi. Inventory and set procedures for the interstate loan and delivery of human and material resources, together with procedures for reimbursement or forgiveness.

vii. Provide, to the extent authorized by law, for temporary suspension of any statutes.

B. The authorized representative of a party state may request assistance of another party state by contacting the authorized representative of that state.  The provisions of this agreement shall only apply to requests for assistance made by and to authorized representatives. Requests may be verbal or in writing.  If verbal, the request shall be confirmed in writing within thirty days of the verbal request.  Requests shall provide the following information:

i. A description of the emergency service function for which assistance is needed, such as but not limited to fire services, law enforcement, emergency medical, transportation, communications, public works and engineering, building inspection, planning and information assistance, mass care, resource support, health and medical services, and search and rescue.

ii. The amount and type of personnel, equipment, materials and supplies needed, and a reasonable estimate of the length of time they will be needed.

iii. The specific place and time for staging of the assisting party's response and a point of contact at that location.

C. There shall be frequent consultation between state officials who have assigned emergency management responsibilities and other appropriate representatives of the party states with affected jurisdictions and the United States government, with free exchange of information, plans and resource records relating to emergency capabilities.

ARTICLE IV &#822; LIMITATIONS

Any party state requested to render mutual aid or conduct exercises and training for mutual aid shall take such action as is necessary to provide and make available the resources covered by this compact in accordance with the terms hereof; provided that it is understood that the state rendering aid may withhold resources to the extent necessary to provide reasonable protection for such state. Each party state shall afford to the emergency forces of any party state, while operating within its state limits under the terms and conditions of this compact, the same powers (except that of arrest unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights and privileges as are afforded forces of the state in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces will continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units will come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the state receiving assistance.  These conditions may be activated, as needed, only subsequent to a declaration of a state of emergency or disaster by the governor of the party state that is to receive assistance or commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and shall continue so long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the state of emergency or disaster remains in effect or loaned resources remain in the receiving state, whichever is longer.

ARTICLE V &#822; LICENSES AND PERMITS

Whenever any person holds a license, certificate or other permit issued by any state party to the compact evidencing the meeting of qualifications for professional, mechanical or other skills, and when such assistance is requested by the receiving party state, such person shall be deemed licensed, certified or permitted by the state requesting assistance to render aid involving such skill to meet a declared emergency or disaster, subject to such limitations and conditions as the governor of the requesting state may prescribe by executive order or otherwise.

ARTICLE VI &#822;&#822; LIABILITY

Officers or employees of a party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be considered agents of the requesting state for tort liability and immunity purposes; and no party state or its officers or employees rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be liable on account of any act or omission in good faith on the part of such forces while so engaged or on account of the maintenance or use of any equipment or supplies in connection therewith.  Good faith in this article shall not include willful misconduct, gross negligence or recklessness.

ARTICLE VII &#822; SUPPLEMENTARY AGREEMENTS

Inasmuch as it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more states may differ from that among the states that are party hereto, this instrument contains elements of a broad base common to all states, and nothing herein contained shall preclude any state from entering into supplementary agreements with another state or affect any other agreements already in force between states.  Supplementary agreements may comprehend, but shall not be limited to, provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, police, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, and equipment and supplies.

ARTICLE VIII &#822; COMPENSATION

Each party state shall provide for the payment of compensation and death benefits to injured members of the emergency forces of that state and representatives of deceased members of such forces in case such members sustain injuries or are killed while rendering aid pursuant to this compact, in the same manner and on the same terms as if the injury or death were sustained within their own state.

ARTICLE IX &#822; REIMBURSEMENT

Any party state rendering aid in another state pursuant to this compact shall be reimbursed by the party state receiving such aid for any loss or damage to or expense incurred in the operation of any equipment and the provision of any service in answering a request for aid and for the costs incurred in connection with such requests; provided, that any aiding party state may assume in whole or in part such loss, damage, expense, or other cost, or may loan such equipment or donate such services to the receiving party state without charge or cost; and provided further, that any two or more party states may enter into supplementary agreements establishing a different allocation of costs among those states.  Article VIII expenses shall not be reimbursable under this provision.

ARTICLE X &#822; EVACUATION

Plans for the orderly evacuation and interstate reception of portions of the civilian population as the result of any emergency or disaster of sufficient proportions to so warrant, shall be worked out and maintained between the party states and the emergency management/services directors of the various jurisdictions where any type of incident requiring evacuations might occur.  Such plans shall be put into effect by request of the state from which evacuees come and shall include the manner of transporting such evacuees, the number of evacuees to be received in different areas, the manner in which food, clothing, housing, and medical care will be provided, the registration of the evacuees, the providing of facilities for the notification of relatives or friends, and the forwarding of such evacuees to other areas or the bringing in of additional materials, supplies, and all other relevant factors. Such plans shall provide that the party state receiving evacuees and the party state from which the evacuees come shall mutually agree as to reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred in receiving and caring for such evacuees, for expenditures for transportation, food, clothing, medicines and medical care, and like items.  Such expenditures shall be reimbursed as agreed by the party state from which the evacuees come.  After the termination of the emergency or disaster, the party state from which the evacuees come shall assume the responsibility for the ultimate support of repatriation of such evacuees.

ARTICLE XI &#822; IMPLEMENTATION

A. This compact shall become operative immediately upon its enactment into law by any two (2) states; thereafter, this compact shall become effective as to any other state upon its enactment by such state.

B. Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until thirty days after the governor of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of such withdrawal to the governors of all other party states.  Such action shall not relieve the withdrawing state from obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

C. Duly authenticated copies of this compact and of such supplementary agreements as may be entered into shall, at the time of their approval, be deposited with each of the party states and with the federal emergency management agency and other appropriate agencies of the United States government.

ARTICLE XII &#822; VALIDITY

This act shall be construed to effectuate the purposes stated in article I hereof.  If any provision of this compact is declared unconstitutional, or the applicability thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the constitutionality of the remainder of this act and the applicability thereof to other persons and circumstances shall not be affected thereby.

ARTICLE XIII &#822; ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS

Nothing in this compact shall authorize or permit the use of military force by the national guard of a state at any place outside that state in any emergency for which the president is authorized by law to call into federal service the militia, or for any purpose for which the use of the army or the air force would in the absence of express statutory authorization be prohibited under section 1385 of title 18, United States Code.

A person, while being held for trial, shall not be subjected to punishment or penalty other than arrest or confinement on the charges pending against him nor shall the arrest or confinement imposed on him be any more rigorous than the circumstances required to ensure his presence, but he may be subjected to minor punishment during that period for infractions of discipline and may be required to perform such labor as may be necessary for the policing and sanitation of his living quarters and mess facilities and the immediately adjacent area.

#### Section 26-1014. Delivery of offenders to civil authorities

### Article 3 - Nonjudicial Punishment

#### Section 26-1015. Commanding officer; nonjudicial punishments; appeal

A. Under rules the governor adopts and under any additional rules adopted by the adjutant general, limitations may be placed on the powers granted by this chapter with respect to the kind and amount of punishment authorized, the categories of commanding officers and warrant officers exercising command authorized to exercise those powers, the applicability of this chapter to an accused who demands trial by court-martial and the kinds of courts-martial to which the case may be referred on a demand. Punishment may not be imposed on any member of the national guard under this chapter if the member, before the imposition of the punishment, has demanded trial by court-martial in lieu of the punishment. A member of the national guard may not demand a trial by court-martial in lieu of the punishment if the nonjudicial punishment options do not include arrest in quarters or restriction.  Similar rules may be adopted with respect to the suspension of authorized punishments. If authorized by rules of the adjutant general, a commanding officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general flag rank in command may delegate the officer's powers under this article to a principal assistant.

B. Subject to subsection A of this section, any commanding officer, in addition to or in lieu of admonition or reprimand, may impose one or more of the following disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a court-martial:

1. On officers of the commanding officer's command:

(a) Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than thirty consecutive days.

(b) If imposed by the governor, the adjutant general or a general officer in command:

(i) Arrest in quarters for not more than thirty consecutive days.

(ii) Forfeiture in an amount of not more than twenty-eight drill periods.

(iii) Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than sixty consecutive days.

2. On other personnel of the commanding officer's command:

(a) Correctional custody for not more than seven consecutive days.

(b) Forfeiture in an amount of not more than seven drill periods.

(c) Reduction to the next inferior pay grade, if the grade from which the person demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction.

(d) Extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than fourteen consecutive days.

(e) Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than fourteen consecutive days.

(f) If imposed by an officer of the grade of major or above:

(i) Correctional custody for not more than thirty consecutive days.

(ii) Forfeiture in an amount of not more than twenty-eight drill periods.

(iii) Reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade, but an enlisted member in a pay grade above E-4 may not be reduced more than two pay grades.  The pay grade from which the person is demoted must be within the promotion authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the officer who imposes the reduction.

(iv) Extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more than forty-five consecutive days.

(v) Restriction to certain specified limits, with or without suspension from duty, for not more than sixty consecutive days.

C. Two or more of the punishments of arrest in quarters, correctional custody, extra duties or restriction may not be combined to run consecutively in the maximum amount that may be imposed for each. If any of those punishments are combined to run consecutively, there shall be an apportionment. For the purpose of this subsection, "correctional custody" means the physical restraint of a person during duty or nonduty hours and may include extra duties, fatigue duties or hard labor. If practicable, correctional custody shall not be served in immediate association with persons awaiting trial or held in confinement pursuant to trial by court-martial.

D. An officer in charge may impose on enlisted members assigned to the unit of which the officer is in charge punishments authorized under subsection B, paragraph 2 of this section as the governor specifically prescribes by rule.

E. The officer who imposes a punishment authorized in subsection B of this section or the officer's successor in command may suspend probationally, at any time, any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may suspend probationally a reduction in grade or a forfeiture imposed under subsection B of this section, whether or not the punishment is executed. In addition, the officer may remit or mitigate, at any time, any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may set aside in whole or in part the punishment, whether executed or unexecuted, and restore all rights, privileges and property affected. The officer may also mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay. If mitigating an arrest in quarters to restriction, a correctional custody to extra duties or restriction, or both, or extra duties to restriction, the mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the punishment mitigated. If mitigating reduction in grade to forfeiture of pay, the amount of the forfeiture shall not be greater than the amount that could have been imposed initially under this article by the officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.

F. A person who is punished under this article and who considers the punishment unjust or disproportionate to the offense may appeal, through the proper channel, to the next superior authority. The appeal shall be promptly forwarded and decided, but the person punished may be required in the meantime to undergo the punishment adjudged. The superior authority may exercise the same powers with respect to the punishment imposed as may be exercised under subsection E of this section by the officer who imposed the punishment. Before acting on an appeal from a punishment of arrest in quarters for more than seven days, correctional custody for more than seven days, forfeiture of more than seven days' pay, reduction of one or more pay grades from the fourth or a higher grade, extra duties for more than fourteen days or restriction for more than fourteen days, the authority who is to act on the appeal shall refer the case to a judge advocate for consideration and advice and may so refer the case on appeal from any punishment imposed under subsection B of this section.

G. The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this section for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial for a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission, and not properly punishable under this section. The fact that a disciplinary punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accused at trial, and if shown shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment to be adjudged if there is a finding of guilty.

H. The adjutant general, by rule, may prescribe the form of records to be kept of proceedings under this section and may also prescribe that certain categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.

After such a request, the accused shall not be tried by a general or special court-martial which does not include enlisted members of at least one-third of the total membership of the court, unless eligible enlisted members cannot be obtained on account of physical conditions or military exigencies. If such members cannot be obtained, the court may be assembled and the trial held without them, but the convening authority shall make a detailed written statement and append it to the record stating why they could not be obtained. In this subsection, "unit" means any regularly organized body of the national guard not larger than a company or battery or a body corresponding to a company or battery.

D. If it can be avoided, a member of the national guard shall not be tried by a court-martial with any member who is junior to him in rank or grade.

If a general court-martial, other than a general court-martial composed of a military judge only, is reduced below five members, the trial shall not proceed unless the convening authority details new members sufficient in number to provide not fewer than five members.

C. If a special court-martial, other than a special court-martial composed of a military judge only, is reduced below three members, the trial shall not proceed unless the convening authority details new members sufficient in number to provide not fewer than three members. The trial shall proceed with the new members present as if no evidence had previously been introduced at the trial, unless a verbatim record of the evidence previously introduced before the members of the court or a stipulation is read to the court in the presence of the military judge, if any, the accused and counsel for both sides.

D. If the military judge of a court-martial composed of a military judge only is unable to proceed with the trial because of physical disability, as a result of a challenge or for other cause, the trial shall proceed, subject to any applicable conditions of section 26-1016, paragraph 1, subdivision (b) and paragraph 2, subdivision (c) after the detail of a new military judge as if no evidence had previously been introduced, unless a verbatim record of the evidence previously introduced or a stipulation is read in court in the presence of the new military judge, the accused and counsel for both sides.

A. Before directing the trial of any charge by general court-martial, the convening authority shall refer it to the staff judge advocate for consideration and advice. The convening authority shall not refer a specification under a charge to a general court-martial for trial unless he has been advised of all of the following in writing by the staff judge advocate:

1. The specification alleges an offense in this chapter.

2. The specification is warranted by the evidence indicated in the investigation and allied papers provided under section 26-1033.

3. A court-martial would have jurisdiction over the accused and the offense.

B. The advice of the staff judge advocate under subsection A of this section with respect to a specification under a charge shall include a written and signed statement by the staff judge advocate expressing his conclusions with respect to each matter set forth in subsection A of this section and recommending action that the convening authority take regarding the specification. If the specification is referred for trial, the recommendation of the staff judge advocate shall accompany the specification.

C. If the charges or specifications are not formally correct or do not conform to the substance of the evidence contained in the report of the investigating officer, formal corrections and such changes in the charges and specifications as are needed to make them conform to the evidence may be made.

#### Section 26-1035. Service of charges

The trial counsel to whom court-martial charges are referred for trial shall serve on the accused a copy of the charges on which trial is to be had. In time of peace, a person, against his objection, shall not be brought to trial or be required to participate by himself or counsel in a session called by the military judge under section 26-1039, subsection A, in a general court-martial case within a period of five days after the service of charges on him or in a special court-martial within a period of three days after the service of the charges on him.

### Article 7 - Trial Procedure

#### Section 26-1036. Governor's rule making authority

A. Pretrial, trial and post-trial procedures, including modes of proof, for cases arising under this chapter triable in courts-martial, military commissions and other military tribunals, and procedures for courts of inquiry, may be prescribed by the governor by rules which, so far as practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in this state but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.

B. All rules adopted under this chapter shall be as uniform as practicable and shall be in force and effect on approval by the governor.

#### Section 26-1037. Unlawfully influencing action of court

A. An authority convening a general, special or summary court-martial, or any other commanding officer, shall not censure, reprimand or admonish the court or any member, military judge or counsel, with respect to the findings or sentence adjudged by the court, or with respect to any other exercises of its or his functions in the conduct of the proceedings. A person subject to this chapter shall not attempt to coerce or, by any unauthorized means, influence the action of a court-martial or any other military tribunal or any member of a tribunal in reaching the findings or sentence in any case, or the action of any convening, approving or reviewing authority with respect to judicial acts. This subsection does not apply to general instructional or informational courses in military justice if such courses are designed solely for the purpose of instructing members of a command in the substantive and procedural aspects of courts-martial or to statements and instructions given in open court by the military judge, president of a special court-martial or counsel.

B. In the preparation of an effectiveness, fitness or efficiency report or any other report or document used in whole or in part for the purpose of determining whether a member of the national guard is qualified to be advanced in grade, in determining the assignment or transfer of a member of the national guard or in determining whether a member of the national guard should be retained, a person subject to this chapter, in preparing any such report, shall not consider or evaluate the performance of duty of any such member of a court-martial or give a less favorable rating or evaluation of any member of the national guard because of the zeal with which such member, as counsel, represented any accused before a court-martial.

#### Section 26-1038. Duties of trial counsel and defense counsel

A. The trial counsel of a general or special court-martial shall prosecute in the name of the state and shall prepare, under the direction of the court, the record of the proceedings.

B. The accused has the right to be represented in his defense before a general or special court-martial or at an investigation as provided in this section.

C. The accused may be represented by civilian counsel if provided by him.

D. The accused may be represented by military counsel detailed under section 26-1027 or by military counsel of his own selection if that counsel is reasonably available.

E. If the accused is represented by civilian counsel, military counsel shall act as associate counsel unless excused at the request of the accused.

F. Except as provided by subsection G of this section, if the accused is represented by military counsel of his own selection, any military counsel detailed shall be excused.

G. The accused is not entitled to be represented by more than one military counsel. However, the person authorized under rules adopted under section 26-1027 to detail counsel in his sole discretion:

1. May detail additional military counsel as assistant defense counsel.

2. If the accused is represented by military counsel of his own selection, may approve a request from the accused that military counsel detailed act as associate defense counsel.

H. The adjutant general, by rule, shall define "reasonably available" for the purpose of subsection D of this section and establish procedures for determining whether the military counsel selected by an accused is reasonably available. These rules shall not prescribe any limitation based on the reasonable availability of counsel solely on the grounds that the counsel selected by the accused is from a component of the national guard other than the component of which the accused is a member. To the maximum extent practicable, these rules shall be consistent with the regulations governing the military forces of the United States.

I. In any court-martial proceeding resulting in a conviction, the defense counsel may:

1. Forward for attachment to the record of proceedings a brief of those matters he determines should be considered in behalf of the accused on review, including any objection to the contents of the record which he considers appropriate.

2. Assist the accused in the submission of any matter under section 26-1060.

3. Take other action authorized by this chapter.

J. Under the direction of the trial counsel or if he is qualified to be a trial counsel, an assistant trial counsel of a general court-martial may perform any duty imposed by law, rule or the custom of the service on the trial counsel of the court. An assistant trial counsel of a special court-martial may perform any duty of the trial counsel.

K. Under the direction of the defense counsel or if he is qualified to be the defense counsel, an assistant defense counsel of a general or special court-martial may perform any duty imposed by law, rule or the custom of the service on counsel for the accused.

#### Section 26-1039. Sessions

A. At any time after the service of charges which have been referred for trial to a court-martial composed of a military judge and members, the military judge, subject to section 26-1035, may call the court into session without the presence of the members but conducted in the presence of the accused, the defense counsel and the trial counsel and as part of the record, for the purpose of:

1. Hearing and determining motions raising defenses or objections which are capable of determination without trial of the issues raised by a plea of not guilty.

2. Hearing and ruling on any matter which may be ruled on by the military judge under this chapter, whether or not the matter is appropriate for later consideration or decision by the members of the court.

3. If permitted by rules of the adjutant general, holding the arraignment and receiving the pleas of the accused.

4. Performing any other procedural function which may be performed by the military judge and which does not require the presence of the members of the court.

B. When the members of a court-martial deliberate or vote, only the members may be present. All other proceedings, including any other consultation of the members of the court with counsel or the military judge, shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused, the defense counsel, the trial counsel and, in cases in which a military judge has been detailed to the court, the military judge.

#### Section 26-1040. Continuances

The military judge or a court-martial without a judge, for reasonable cause, may grant a continuance to any party for such time, and as often, as is just.

#### Section 26-1041. Challenges

A. The military judge and members of a general or special court-martial may be challenged by the accused or the trial counsel for cause stated to the court. The military judge, or if none, the court, shall determine the relevance and validity of challenges for cause and may not receive a challenge to more than one person at a time. Challenges by the trial counsel shall ordinarily be presented and decided before those by the accused are offered.

B. Each accused and the trial counsel is entitled to one peremptory challenge, but the military judge may not be challenged except for cause.

#### Section 26-1042. Oaths

A. Before performing their respective duties, military judges, members of general and special courts-martial, trial counsel, assistant trial counsel, defense counsel, assistant or associate defense counsel, reporters and interpreters shall take an oath to perform their duties faithfully. The form of the oath, the time and place of taking the oath, the manner of recording the oath and whether the oath shall be taken for all cases in which these duties are to be performed or for a particular case shall be as prescribed in rules of the adjutant general. The rules may provide that an oath to perform faithfully duties as a military judge, trial counsel, assistant trial counsel, defense counsel or assistant or associate defense counsel may be taken at any time by any judge advocate or other person certified to be qualified or competent for the duty, and if such an oath is taken it need not again be taken at the time the judge advocate, or other person, is detailed to that duty.

B. Each witness before a court-martial shall be examined on oath.

#### Section 26-1043. Statute of limitations

A. Except as otherwise provided in this article, a person charged with an offense is not liable to be tried by court-martial or punished under section 26-1015 if the offense was committed more than two years before the receipt of sworn charges and specifications by an officer exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction over the command or before the imposition of punishment under section 26-1015.

B. Periods in which the accused was absent from territory in which the state has the authority to apprehend him, was in the custody of civil authorities or was in the hands of the enemy shall be excluded in computing the period of limitation prescribed in this section.

#### Section 26-1044. Former jeopardy

A. No person, without his consent, may be tried a second time for the same offense.

B. No proceeding in which an accused has been found guilty by court-martial on any charge or specification is a trial in the sense of this section until the finding of guilt becomes final after review of the case has been fully completed.

C. A proceeding in which, after introduction of evidence but before a finding, is dismissed or terminated by the convening authority or on motion of the prosecution for failure of available evidence or witnesses without any fault of the accused is a trial for purposes of this article.

#### Section 26-1045. Pleas of the accused

A. If an accused after arraignment makes an irregular pleading, or after a plea of guilty sets up matter inconsistent with the plea, or if it appears that he has entered the plea of guilty improvidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effect, or if he fails or refuses to plead, a plea of not guilty shall be entered in the record, and the court shall proceed as though he had pleaded not guilty.

B. With respect to any charge or specification to which a plea of guilty has been made by the accused and accepted by the military judge or by a court-martial without a military judge, a finding of guilty of the charge or specification, if permitted by rules of the adjutant general, may be entered immediately without vote. This finding constitutes the finding of the court unless the plea of guilty is withdrawn before announcement of the sentence, in which event the proceedings shall continue as though the accused had pleaded not guilty.

#### Section 26-1046. Opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence

The trial counsel, the defense counsel and the court-martial shall have equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and other evidence in accordance with rules the governor adopts.

#### Section 26-1047. Refusal to appear or testify

Any person who has been duly subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a court-martial, military commission, court of inquiry or other military court or board, or before any military or civil officer designated to take a deposition to be read in evidence before such a court, commission or board, or who has been duly paid or tendered the fees and mileage of a witness at the rates allowed to witnesses attending the courts of the state and who willfully neglects or refuses to appear, or refuses to qualify as a witness or to testify or to produce any evidence which that person may have been legally subpoenaed to produce, is in contempt of court and may be punished in the same manner as if the contempt were committed before civil courts of this state.

#### Section 26-1048. Contempt

A court-martial may punish any person for contempt who uses any menacing word, sign or gesture in its presence or who disturbs its proceedings by any riot or disorder. The punishment shall not exceed confinement for thirty days or a fine of one hundred dollars, or both.

#### Section 26-1049. Depositions

A. At any time after charges have been signed as provided in section 26-1030, any party may take oral or written depositions unless the military judge or court-martial without a military judge hearing the case or, if the case is not being heard, an authority competent to convene a court-martial for the trial of those charges forbids it for good cause. If a deposition is to be taken before charges are referred for trial, such an authority may designate commissioned officers to represent the prosecution and the defense and may authorize those officers to take the deposition of any witness.

B. The party at whose instance a deposition is to be taken shall give to every other party reasonable written notice of the time and place for taking the deposition.

C. Depositions may be taken before and authenticated by any military or civil officer authorized by the laws of the state or by the laws of the place where the deposition is taken to administer oaths.

D. A duly authenticated deposition taken on reasonable notice to the other parties, so far as otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, may be read in evidence or, in the case of audiotape, videotape or similar material, may be played in evidence before any military court in any case, or in any proceeding before a court of inquiry or military board, if one or more of the following applies:

1. The witness resides or is not within the state in which the court or board is ordered to sit, or is more than one hundred miles from the place of trial or hearing.

2. The witness by reason of death, age, sickness, bodily infirmity, imprisonment, military necessity, nonamenability to process or other reasonable cause is unable or refuses to appear and testify in person at the place of trial or hearing.

3. The present whereabouts of the witness is unknown.

#### Section 26-1050. Admissibility of records of courts of inquiry

A. In any case not extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer, the sworn testimony, contained in the duly authenticated record of proceedings of a court of inquiry, of a person whose oral testimony cannot be obtained, if otherwise admissible under the rules of evidence, may be read in evidence by any party before a court-martial or military commission if the accused was a party before the court of inquiry and if the same issue was involved or if the accused consents to the introduction of such evidence.

B. This testimony may be read in evidence only by the defense in cases extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer.

C. This testimony may also be read in evidence before a court of inquiry or a military board.

#### Section 26-1051. Voting and rulings

A. Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the findings and on the sentence, and by members of a court-martial without a military judge on questions of challenge, shall be by secret written ballot. The junior member of the court shall count the votes. The count shall be checked by the president, who shall immediately announce the result of the ballot to the members of the court.

B. The military judge and, except for questions of challenge, the president of a court-martial without a military judge shall rule on all questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the proceedings. Any such ruling made by the military judge on any question of law or any interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental responsibility of the accused, or by the president of a court-martial without a military judge on any question of law other than a motion for a finding of not guilty, is final and constitutes the ruling of the court. However, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge may change his ruling at any time during the trial. Unless the ruling is final, if any member objects, the court shall be cleared and closed and the question decided by a voice vote as provided in section 26-1052, beginning with the junior in rank.

C. Before a vote is taken on the findings, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a military judge, in the presence of the accused and counsel, shall instruct the members of the court as to the elements of the offense and charge them:

1. That the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt.

2. That, in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the accused and he must be acquitted.

3. That, if there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt.

4. That the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt is on this state.

D. Subsections A, B and C of this section do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of such a court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence. The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and in addition on request shall find the facts specially. If an opinion or memorandum of decision if filed, it is sufficient if the findings of fact appear in the opinion or memorandum of decision.

#### Section 26-1052. Number of votes required

A. A person shall not be convicted of any offense except as provided in section 26-1045 or by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken.

B. All sentences shall be determined by the concurrence of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken.

C. All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote, but a determination to reconsider a finding of guilty or to reconsider a sentence, with a view toward decreasing it, may be made by any lesser vote which indicates that the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of votes required for that finding or sentence. A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged. A tie vote on a motion for a finding of not guilty or on a motion relating to the question of the accused's sanity is a determination against the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused.

#### Section 26-1053. Announcement of action

A court-martial shall announce its findings and sentence to the parties as soon as they are determined.

#### Section 26-1054. Record of trial

A. Each general court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case brought before it, and the record shall be authenticated by the signature of the military judge. If the record cannot be authenticated by the military judge by reason of his death, disability or absence, it shall be authenticated by the signature of the trial counsel or by that of a member if the trial counsel is unable to authenticate it by reason of his death, disability or absence. In a court-martial consisting of only a military judge the record shall be authenticated by the court reporter under the same conditions which would impose such a duty on a member under this subsection.

B. Each special and summary court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case, and the record shall be authenticated in the manner required by rule the governor adopts.

C. A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as it is authenticated.

### Article 8 - Sentences

#### Section 26-1055. Sentences; reduction in enlisted grade on approval

A. Unless otherwise provided in rules prescribed by the adjutant general, a court-martial sentence of an enlisted member in a pay grade above E-1, as approved by the convening authority, that includes a dishonorable or bad conduct discharge, confinement or hard labor without confinement reduces that member to pay grade E-1, effective on the date of the approval.

B. If the sentence of a member who is reduced in pay grade under subsection A is set aside or disapproved, or as finally approved, does not include any punishment named in subsection A, the rights and privileges of which he was deprived because of the reduction shall be restored to him and he is entitled to the pay and allowances to which he would have been entitled for the period the reduction was in effect had he not been so reduced.

C. A sentence of dismissal or dishonorable discharge shall not be executed until it is approved by the governor.

#### Section 26-1056. Maximum limits

The punishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense shall not exceed the limits the governor prescribes for the offense.

#### Section 26-1057. Effective date of sentences

A. A forfeiture shall not extend to any pay or allowances accrued before the date on which the sentence is approved by a person acting under section 26-1060.

B. Any period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date ordered by the court-martial pursuant to 26-208, but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of confinement.

C. All other sentences of courts-martial are effective on the date they are ordered executed.

D. On application by an accused who is under sentence to confinement that has not been ordered executed, the convening authority, or if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, the adjutant general, may in his sole discretion defer service of the sentence to confinement. The deferment terminates when the sentence is ordered executed. The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the officer who granted it, or if the accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, by the adjutant general.

#### Section 26-1058. Execution of confinement

A. A sentence of confinement adjudged by a military court, whether or not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal, and whether or not the discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be carried into execution by confinement in any place of confinement under the control of any of the forces of the national guard or in any jail, penitentiary or prison. Persons confined in a jail, penitentiary or prison are subject to the same discipline and treatment as persons confined or committed to the jail, penitentiary or prison by the courts of this state or of any political subdivision.

B. The omission of the words "hard labor" from any sentence or punishment of a court-martial adjudging confinement does not deprive the authority executing that sentence or punishment of the power to require hard labor as a part of the punishment.

C. The keepers, officers and wardens of city or county jails and of other jails, penitentiaries or prisons designated by the governor shall receive persons ordered into confinement before trial and persons committed to confinement by a military court and shall confine them according to law. A keeper, officer or warden shall not require payment of any fee or charge for receiving or confining a person. Confinement orders shall be signed by trial counsel.

### Article 9 - Post-Trial Procedure and Review of Courts-Martial

#### Section 26-1059. Error of law; lesser included offense

A. A finding or sentence of a court-martial shall not be held incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.

B. Any reviewing authority with the power to approve or affirm a finding of guilty may approve or affirm, instead, any part of the finding that includes a lesser included offense.

#### Section 26-1060. Action by the convening authority

A. After a trial by court-martial, the record shall be forwarded to the convening authority, as reviewing authority, and action on the record may be taken by the person who convened the court, a commissioned officer commanding for the time being, a successor in command or the governor.

B. The authority under this section to modify the findings and sentence of a court-martial is a matter of command prerogative involving the sole discretion of the convening authority. Under rules of the adjutant general, a commissioned officer commanding for the time being, a successor in command or any person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction may act under this section in place of the convening authority.

C. Action on the findings of a court-martial by the convening authority or other person acting on the sentence is not required, but such person, in his sole discretion, may dismiss any charge or specification by setting aside a finding of guilty or change a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the charge or specification.

D. Before acting under this section on any general court-martial case or any special court-martial case that includes a bad conduct discharge, the convening authority or other person taking action under this section shall obtain and consider the written recommendation of the staff judge advocate. The convening authority or other person taking action under this section shall refer the record of trial to his staff judge advocate, and the staff judge advocate shall use the record in the preparation of his recommendation. The recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer shall include matters that the governor prescribes by rule and shall be served on the accused, who shall have ten days from the date of receipt in which to submit any matter in response. The convening authority or other person taking action under this section, for good cause, may extend that period for up to an additional twenty days. Failure to object in the response to the recommendation or to any matter attached to the recommendation waives the right to object.

E. The convening authority or other person taking action under this section, in his sole discretion, may order a proceeding in revision or a rehearing.

F. A proceeding in revision may be ordered if there is an apparent error or omission in the record or if the record shows improper or inconsistent action by a court-martial with respect to the findings or sentence that can be rectified without material prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused. A proceeding in revision shall not:

1. Reconsider a finding of not guilty of any specification or a ruling which amounts to a finding of not guilty.

2. Reconsider a finding of not guilty of any charge, unless there has been a finding of guilty under a specification laid under that charge, which sufficiently alleges a violation of some article of this chapter.

3. Increase the severity of some article of the sentence unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory.

G. A rehearing may be ordered by the convening authority or other person taking action under this section if he disapproves the findings and sentence and states the reasons for disapproval of the findings. If such person disapproves the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, he shall dismiss the charges. A rehearing as to the findings may not be ordered if there is a lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings. A rehearing as to the sentence may be ordered if the convening authority or other person taking action under this subsection disapproves the sentence.

#### Section 26-1061. Withdrawal of appeal

The accused may withdraw an appeal at any time.

#### Section 26-1062. Appeal by the state

A. In a trial by court-martial in which a military judge presides and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged, the state may appeal an order or ruling of the military judge which terminates the proceedings with respect to a charge or specification or which excludes evidence that is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding. The state shall not appeal an order or ruling that is, or that amounts to, a finding of not guilty with respect to the charge or specification.

B. An appeal of an order or ruling shall not be taken unless the trial counsel provides the military judge with written notice of appeal from the order or ruling within seventy-two hours after the order or ruling. The notice shall include a certification by the trial counsel that the appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and, if the order or ruling appealed is one which excludes evidence, that the evidence excluded is substantial proof of a fact material in the proceeding.

C. An appeal under this section shall be diligently prosecuted by trial counsel.

D. An appeal under this section shall be forwarded by a means prescribed under rules of the governor directly to the Arizona court of military appeals and, if practicable, has priority over all other proceedings before that court. In ruling on an appeal under this section, the Arizona court of military appeals may act only with respect to matters of law.

E. Any period of delay resulting from an appeal under this section shall be excluded in deciding any issue regarding denial of a speedy trial unless an appropriate authority determines that the appeal was filed solely for the purpose of delay with the knowledge that it was totally frivolous and without merit.

#### Section 26-1063. Rehearings

Each rehearing under this chapter shall take place before a court-martial composed of members who are not members of the court-martial which first heard the case. On a rehearing the accused may not be tried for any offense of which he was found not guilty by the first court-martial, and a sentence in excess of or more severe than the original sentence shall not be imposed, unless the sentence is based on a finding of guilty of an offense not considered on the merits in the original proceedings, or unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory. If the sentence approved after the first court-martial was in accordance with a pretrial agreement and the accused at the rehearing changes his plea with respect to the charges or specifications on which the pretrial agreement was based, or otherwise does not comply with the pretrial agreement, the sentence as to those charges or specifications may include any punishment not in excess of that lawfully adjudged at the first court-martial.

#### Section 26-1064. Review by judge advocate

A. Each case in which there has been a finding of guilty that is not reviewed under section 26-1067 shall be reviewed by a judge advocate under rules of the adjutant general. A judge advocate shall not review a case under this subsection if he has acted in the same case as an accuser, investigating officer, member of the court, military judge or counsel or has otherwise acted on behalf of the prosecution or defense. The judge advocate's review shall be in writing and shall contain the following:

1. Conclusions as to whether the court had jurisdiction over the accused and the offense, whether the charge and specification stated an offense and whether the sentence was within the limits prescribed as a matter of law.

2. A response to each allegation of error made in writing by the accused.

3. If the case is sent for action under subsection B of this section, a recommendation as to the appropriate action to be taken and an opinion as to whether corrective action is required as a matter of law.

B. The record of trial and related documents in each case reviewed under subsection A of this section shall be sent for action to the person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the accused at the time the court was convened or to that person's successor in command if the judge advocate who reviews the case recommends corrective action, if the sentence approved includes a dismissal, a bad conduct or dishonorable discharge or confinement for more than four months or if such action is otherwise required by rules of the adjutant general.

C. The person to whom the record of trial and related documents are sent under subsection B of this section may:

1. Disapprove or approve the findings or sentence, in whole or in part.

2. Remit, commute or suspend the sentence in whole or in part.

3. Except if the evidence was insufficient at the trial to support the findings, order a rehearing on the findings or on the sentence, or both.

4. Dismiss the charges.

D. If a rehearing is ordered but the convening authority finds a rehearing impracticable, he shall dismiss the charges.

#### Section 26-1065. Disposition of records

Except as otherwise required by this chapter, all other records of trial and related documents shall be transmitted and disposed of as the adjutant general prescribes by rule.

#### Section 26-1067. Court of military appeals; members; terms; compensation; duties; review; procedures

A. The Arizona court of military appeals is established and is located for administrative purposes only in the department of emergency and military affairs. The court shall consist of five judges appointed by the governor on the recommendation of the adjutant general with the advice of the state judge advocate for a term of six years. Initial appointments shall be staggered. The term of office for all successor judges is six years, but any judge appointed to fill a vacancy occurring before the expiration of the term for which the judge's predecessor was appointed shall be appointed only for the unexpired term of the predecessor. Not more than three judges of the court may be appointed from the same political party. Judges may succeed themselves in office. A person is eligible for appointment to this court who, in addition to the requirements of article VI, section 22, Constitution of Arizona, has at least five years' experience as a judge advocate in the national guard or armed forces of the United States.

B. Before appointment by the governor, a prospective judge shall submit a full set of fingerprints to the governor for the purpose of obtaining a state and federal criminal records check pursuant to section 41-1750 and Public Law 92-544. The department of public safety may exchange this fingerprint data with the federal bureau of investigation.

C. The governor shall designate one of the judges to act as chief judge. The chief judge has precedence and shall preside at any session the judge attends. The other judges have precedence and shall preside according to the seniority of their appointments. Judges whose commissions bear the same date have precedence according to seniority in age.

D. The court shall sit in panels of no less than three judges to be selected by the presiding judge.
