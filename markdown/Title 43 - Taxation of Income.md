Except as provided by subsections B and H of this section, every employer at the time of the payment of wages, salary, bonus or other emolument to any employee whose compensation is for services performed within this state shall deduct and retain from the compensation an amount prescribed by tables adopted by the department.

B. An employer may voluntarily elect to not withhold tax during December by notifying:

1. The department on a form prescribed by the department.

2. The employer's employees in writing in a manner prescribed by the department.

C. If the amount collected and payable by the employer to the department in each of the preceding four calendar quarters did not exceed an average of one thousand five hundred dollars, the amount collected shall be paid to the department on or before April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31 for the preceding calendar quarter.  If the amount exceeded one thousand five hundred dollars in each of the preceding four calendar quarters, the employer shall pay to the department the amount the employer deducts and retains pursuant to this section at the same time as the employer is required to make deposits of federal tax pursuant to section 6302 of the internal revenue code.  On or before April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31 each year, the employer shall reconcile the amounts payable during the preceding calendar quarter in a manner prescribed by the department, except that if the full amount collected and payable is paid timely to the department under this subsection, the employer may reconcile the amounts on or before May 10, August 10, November 10 and February 10 each year.  The department by rule may allow and determine which employers qualify for annual payments of withholding taxes, with an annual report by the employer pursuant to section 43-412, subsection B, if the qualifying employer has established sufficient payment history to indicate that the employer is current and in good standing pursuant to standards established by rule.  For any business that has not had a withholding certificate for the four preceding consecutive quarters, the quarterly average shall be computed in a manner prescribed by the department.

D. If an employer fails to make a timely monthly payment because prior to that reporting period it reported on a quarterly basis instead of on a monthly basis, the department shall notify the employer that it is out of compliance with this section. Notwithstanding section 42-1125, the department shall not assess a penalty against an employer for failing to make a timely monthly payment if the employer had filed and remitted all taxes due on a quarterly basis and brings all filings and payments into current compliance within thirty days after being notified by the department.

E. Each employee shall elect the amount authorized by subsection A of this section to be withheld for application toward the employee's state income tax liability.  The election provided under this subsection shall be exercised by each employee, in writing on a form prescribed by the department.  The election shall be made within five days of employment.  Each employer shall notify the employees of the election made available under this subsection and shall have election forms available at all times.  Each form shall be completed in triplicate, with one copy each for the department, the employer and the employee.  The employer shall file a copy of each completed form with the department.  Any employee failing to complete an election form as prescribed shall be deemed to have elected the withholding percentage prescribed by the department.

F. Before July 1 of each year, each employer who chooses to not withhold tax pursuant to subsection B of this section shall notify each employee that:

1. State income taxes will not be withheld from compensation in December.

2. The employee may elect to change the rate of withholding tax prescribed by this section to compensate for the resulting change in annual withholdings from the employee's compensation.

G. At an employee's written request, the employer may agree to reduce the amount withheld under this section by the amount of credit that the employee represents to the employer that the employee will qualify for and be entitled to under sections 43-1088, 43-1089, 43-1089.01 and 43-1089.03. The employee's request must include the name and address of the qualifying charitable organization, qualified school tuition organization or public school.  Within thirty days after agreeing to the employee's request, the employer shall reduce the withholding amount by the amount of the credit, but not below zero, prorated for the number of pay periods remaining in the employee's taxable year after the employee makes the request.  If an employer agrees to reduce the withholding amount pursuant to this subsection, the following apply:

1. Within fifteen days after the end of each calendar quarter, the employer must pay the entire amount of the reduction in withholding tax for that quarter to the designated charitable organization, school tuition organization or public school.  These payments are considered to be on the employee's behalf, and not the employer's, for the purposes of qualifying for the income tax credits under sections 43-1088, 43-1089, 43-1089.01 and 43-1089.03.

2. The employee is responsible and accountable for the accuracy and the amount of reduction in withholding tax and the payments to the charitable organization, school tuition organization or public school.

3. The employer is responsible and accountable to the charitable organization, school tuition organization or public school, to the employee and to the department for actually making the required payments.

If the allowable amount of such claim exceeds the income taxes otherwise due on the claimant's income, the amount of the claim not used as an offset against income taxes, after audit by the department, shall be paid in the same manner as a refund granted under chapter 6, article 1 of this title. Refunds made pursuant to this paragraph are subject to setoff under section 42-1122.

E. The department shall make available suitable forms with instructions for claimants. Claimants who certify on the prescribed form that they have no income tax liability for the taxable year shall not be required to file an individual income tax return. The claim shall be in such form as the department may prescribe but shall require the social security numbers of persons who were allowed to claim as dependents for the taxes imposed by this title claimants filing pursuant to this section.

In the case of a claim for rent, the claimant shall have rented property in this state during the entire taxable year except as otherwise provided by this section.

If they are unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the department and its decision shall be final. If a homestead is occupied by two or more individuals and more than one individual is able to qualify as a claimant, and some or all of the qualified individuals are not related, the individuals may determine among them as to whom the claimant shall be. If they are unable to agree, the matter shall be referred to the department, and its decision shall be final.

2. "Gross rent" means rental paid for the right of occupancy of a homestead or space rental paid to a landlord for the parking of a mobile home.

4. "Household" means the household of the claimant and such other persons as resided with the claimant in the claimant's homestead during the taxable year.

For purposes of this paragraph, property taxes are "levied" when the tax roll is delivered to the county treasurer for collection. If a claimant and the claimant's household own their homestead part of the taxable year and rent it or different homesteads for the rest of the same year, provided property taxes were levied on the homestead which was owned by the claimant and the claimant's household, such claimant shall be eligible for a credit pursuant to this section.

I. Income as defined in subsection H, paragraph 6, subdivisions (f) and (g) of this section shall not include monies received from cash public assistance and relief, relief granted under the provisions of this section, railroad retirement benefits, payments received under the federal social security act (49 Stat. 620), payments received under Arizona state unemployment insurance laws, payments received from veterans' disability pensions, payments received as workers' compensation, the gross amount of "loss of time" insurance, and gifts from nongovernmental sources or surplus foods or other relief in kind supplied by a governmental agency.

#### Section 43-1074. Credit for new employment

A. For taxable years beginning from and after June 30, 2011, a credit is allowed against the taxes imposed by this title for net increases in full-time employees residing in this state and hired in qualified employment positions in this state as computed and certified by the Arizona commerce authority pursuant to section 41-1525.

B. Subject to subsection F of this section, the amount of the credit is equal to:

1. Three thousand dollars for each full-time employee hired in a qualified employment position in the first year or partial year of employment.  Employees hired in the last ninety days of the taxable year are excluded for that taxable year and are considered to be new employees in the following taxable year.

2. Three thousand dollars for each full-time employee in a qualified employment position for the full taxable year in the second year of continuous employment.

3. Three thousand dollars for each full-time employee in a qualified employment position for the full taxable year in the third year of continuous employment.

C. The capital investment and the new qualified employment positions requirements of section 41-1525, subsection B must be accomplished within twelve months after the start of the required capital investment. A credit may not be claimed until both requirements are met. A business that meets the requirements of section 41-1525, subsection B for a location is eligible to claim first year credits for three years beginning with the taxable year in which those requirements are completed.  Employees hired at the location before the beginning of the taxable year but during the twelve-month period allowed in this subsection are considered to be new employees for the taxable year in which all of those requirements are completed. The employees that are considered to be new employees for the taxable year under this subsection shall not be included in the average number of full-time employees during the immediately preceding taxable year until the taxable year in which all of the requirements of section 41-1525, subsection B are completed.  An employee working at a temporary worksite in this state while the designated location is under construction is considered to be working at the designated location if all of the following occur:

1. The employee is hired after the start of the required investment at the designated location.

2. The employee is hired to work at the designated location after it is completed.

3. The payroll for the employees destined for the designated location is segregated from other employees.

4. The employee is moved to the designated location within thirty days after its completion.

D. To qualify for a credit under this section, the taxpayer and the employment positions must meet the requirements prescribed by section 41-1525.

E. A credit is allowed for employment in the second and third year only for qualified employment positions for which a credit was claimed and allowed in the first year.

F. The net increase in the number of qualified employment positions is the lesser of the total number of filled qualified employment positions created at the designated location or locations during the taxable year or the difference between the average number of full-time employees in this state in the current taxable year and the average number of full-time employees in this state during the immediately preceding taxable year.  The net increase in the number of qualified employment positions computed under this subsection may not exceed the difference between the average number of full-time employees in this state in the current taxable year and the average number of full-time employees in this state during the immediately preceding taxable year.

G. If the allowable tax credit exceeds the income taxes otherwise due on the claimant's income, or if there are no state income taxes due on the claimant's income, the amount of the claim not used as an offset against the income taxes may be carried forward as a tax credit against subsequent years' income tax liability for a period not exceeding five taxable years.

H. Co-owners of a business, including partners in a partnership and shareholders of an S corporation, as defined in section 1361 of the internal revenue code, may each claim only the pro rata share of the credit allowed under this section based on the ownership interest.  The total of the credits allowed all such owners of the business may not exceed the amount that would have been allowed for a sole owner of the business.

I. If the business is sold or changes ownership through reorganization, stock purchase or merger, the new taxpayer may claim first year credits only for the qualified employment positions that it created and filled with an eligible employee after the purchase or reorganization was complete.  If a person purchases a taxpayer that had qualified for first or second year credits or changes ownership through reorganization, stock purchase or merger, the new taxpayer may claim the second or third year credits if it meets other eligibility requirements of this section.  Credits for which a taxpayer qualified before the changes described in this subsection are terminated and lost at the time the changes are implemented.

J. A failure to timely report and certify to the Arizona commerce authority the information prescribed by section 41-1525, subsection E, and in the manner prescribed by section 41-1525, subsection F disqualifies the taxpayer from the credit under this section.  The department shall require written evidence of the timely report to the Arizona commerce authority.

K. A tax credit under this section is subject to recovery for a violation described in section 41-1525, subsection H.

L. For the purposes of subsection B, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section, if a full-time employee in the qualified employment position leaves during the taxable year, the employee may be replaced with another new full-time employee in the same employment position and the new employee will be treated as being in the employee's second or third full year of continuous employment for the purposes of the credit under this section if:

1. The total time the position was vacant from the date the employment position was originally filled to the end of the current tax year totals ninety days or less.

2. The new employee meets all of the same requirements as the original employee was required to meet.

#### Section 43-1074.01. Credit for increased research activities

A. A credit is allowed against the taxes imposed by this title in an amount determined pursuant to section 41 of the internal revenue code, except that:

1. The amount of the credit is based on the excess, if any, of the qualified research expenses for the taxable year over the base amount as defined in section 41(c) of the internal revenue code and is computed as follows:

(a) If the excess is $2,500,000 or less:

(i) For taxable years beginning before December 31, 2030, the credit is equal to twenty-four percent of that amount.

(ii) For taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2030, the credit is equal to twenty percent of that amount.

(b) If the excess is over $2,500,000:

(i) For taxable years beginning before December 31, 2030, the credit is equal to $600,000 plus fifteen percent of any amount exceeding $2,500,000.

(ii) For taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2030, the credit is equal to $500,000 plus eleven percent of any amount exceeding $2,500,000.

(c) For taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2011, an additional credit amount is allowed if the taxpayer made basic research payments during the taxable year to a university under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents. The additional credit amount is equal to ten percent of the excess, if any, of the basic research payments over the qualified organization base period amount for the taxable year. The department shall not allow credit amounts under this subdivision and section 43-1168, subsection A, paragraph 1, subdivision (d) that exceed, in the aggregate, a combined total of $10,000,000 in any calendar year. Subject to that limit, on application by the taxpayer, the department shall certify credit amounts under this subdivision and section 43-1168, subsection A, paragraph 1, subdivision (d) based on priority placement established by the date that the taxpayer filed the application. For taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2014, any basic research payments used to determine the additional credit under this subdivision must first receive certification from the Arizona commerce authority pursuant to section 41-1507.01. The additional credit amount under this subdivision shall not exceed the amount allowed based on actual basic research payments or the department's certification, whichever is less. If an application, if certified in full, would exceed the $10,000,000 limit, the department shall certify only an amount within that limit. After the limit is attained, the department shall deny any subsequent applications regardless of whether other certified amounts are not actually claimed as a credit or other taxpayers fail to qualify to actually claim certified amounts.  Notwithstanding subsections B and C of this section, any amount of the additional credit under this subdivision that exceeds the taxes otherwise due under this title is not refundable, but may be carried forward to the next five consecutive taxable years. For the purposes of this subdivision, "basic research payments" and "qualified organization base period amount" have the same meanings prescribed by section 41(e) of the internal revenue code without regard to whether the taxpayer is or is not a corporation.

2. Qualified research includes only research conducted in this state, including research conducted at a university in this state and paid for by the taxpayer.

3. If two or more taxpayers, including partners in a partnership and shareholders of an S corporation, as defined in section 1361 of the internal revenue code, share in the eligible expenses, each taxpayer is eligible to receive a proportionate share of the credit.

4. The credit under this section applies only to expenses incurred from and after December 31, 2000.

5. The termination provisions of section 41 of the internal revenue code do not apply.

B. Except as provided by subsection C of this section, if the allowable credit under this section exceeds the taxes otherwise due under this title on the claimant's income, or if there are no taxes due under this title, the amount of the credit that is claimed for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022 and that is not used to offset taxes may be carried forward to the next fifteen consecutive taxable years and the amount of the credit that is claimed for taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2021 and that is not used to offset taxes may be carried forward to the next ten consecutive taxable years. The amount of credit carryforward from taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2002 that may be used in any taxable year may not exceed the taxpayer's tax liability under this title minus the credit under this section for the current taxable year's qualified research expenses. A taxpayer who carries forward any amount of credit under this subsection may not thereafter claim a refund of any amount of the credit under subsection C of this section.

C. For taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2009, if a taxpayer who claims a credit under this section employs fewer than one hundred fifty persons in the taxpayer's trade or business and if the allowable credit under this section exceeds the taxes otherwise due under this title on the claimant's income, or if there are no taxes due under this title, in lieu of carrying the excess amount of credit forward to subsequent taxable years under subsection B of this section, the taxpayer may elect to receive a refund as follows:

1. The taxpayer must apply to the Arizona commerce authority for qualification for the refund pursuant to section 41-1507 and submit a copy of the authority's certificate of qualification to the department of revenue with the taxpayer's income tax return.

2. The amount of the refund is limited to seventy-five percent of the amount by which the allowable credit under this section exceeds the taxpayer's tax liability under this title for the taxable year.  The remainder of the excess amount of the credit is waived.

3. The refund shall be paid in the manner prescribed by section 42-1118.

4. The refund is subject to setoff under section 42-1122.

5. If the department determines that a credit refunded pursuant to this subsection is incorrect or invalid, the excess credit issued may be treated as a tax deficiency pursuant to section 42-1108.

#### Section 43-1074.02. Credit for investment in qualified small businesses

A. For taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2006 through December 31, 2034, a credit is allowed against the taxes imposed by this title for investment made after June 30, 2006 in qualified small businesses. The amount of the credit is the amount determined and authorized by the Arizona commerce authority as provided by section 41-1518.

B. To claim the credit under this section, the taxpayer shall attach to its tax return a copy of the Arizona commerce authority certification provided pursuant to section 41-1518. A credit is not allowed under this section unless the taxpayer provides the certification.

C. The basis of any investment with respect to which the taxpayer has claimed a credit under this section shall be reduced by the amount of the credit claimed with respect to that investment.

D. If the allowable tax credit exceeds the taxes due under this title on the claimant's income, or if there are no taxes due under this title, the amount of the claim not used to offset the taxes under this title may be carried forward to the next three consecutive taxable years as a credit against subsequent years' income tax liability.

E. Individuals who are co-owners of a business, including partners in a partnership and shareholders of an S corporation as defined in section 1361 of the internal revenue code, may each claim only their individual pro rata shares of the credit allowed under this section based on their ownership interests. The total of the credits allowed all such owners may not exceed the amount that would have been allowed a sole owner.

F. If the department of revenue determines that there has been a misrepresentation on an application submitted to the Arizona commerce authority under section 41-1518, the department of revenue shall deny the credit if the misrepresentation relates to whether the applicant was a qualified investor or made a qualified investment. If the misrepresentation relates to whether the investment was made to:

1. A qualified small business, the department of revenue shall deny the credit only if the applicant knew or should have known at any time before the certification that the representation was false.

2. A bioscience enterprise or a business that maintains its principal place of business in a rural county in this state, the department of revenue shall decrease the amount of the credit that would have been allowed only if the applicant knew or should have known at any time before the certification that the representation was false.

#### Section 43-1075. Affordable housing tax credit

 

(Rpld. 1/1/26)

 

A. A taxpayer is allowed a credit against the taxes imposed by this title if the Arizona department of housing issues an eligibility statement for a qualified project pursuant to section 41-3954. The amount of the credit:

1. Is equal to at least fifty percent of the amount of the federal low-income housing credit for the qualified project.

2. On notice to the department of revenue, may be allocated among the partners, members or shareholders, as they may agree among themselves regardless of the size of such participant's ownership interest. The total of the allocated credits among all such participants may not exceed the amount of the credit approved by the Arizona department of housing. This paragraph does not prohibit a partner, member or shareholder from holding an investment exclusively in either the state credits or federal credits allocated to the qualified project.

B. To claim the credit under this section, the taxpayer must submit the eligibility statement provided by the Arizona department of housing under section 41-3954 to the department of revenue with the taxpayer's income tax return. A credit under this section is not allowed until the taxpayer furnishes the required documentation.

C.

#### Section 43-1161. Credit for new employment

A. For taxable years beginning from and after June 30, 2011, a credit is allowed against the taxes imposed by this title for net increases in full-time employees residing in this state and hired in qualified employment positions in this state as computed and certified by the Arizona commerce authority pursuant to section 41-1525.

B. Subject to subsection F of this section, the amount of the credit is equal to:

1. Three thousand dollars for each full-time employee hired in a qualified employment position in the first year or partial year of employment.  Employees hired in the last ninety days of the taxable year are excluded for that taxable year and are considered to be new employees in the following taxable year.

2. Three thousand dollars for each full-time employee in a qualified employment position for the full taxable year in the second year of continuous employment.

3. Three thousand dollars for each full-time employee in a qualified employment position for the full taxable year in the third year of continuous employment.

C. The capital investment and the new qualified employment positions requirements of section 41-1525, subsection B must be accomplished within twelve months after the start of the required capital investment.  A credit may not be claimed until both requirements are met. A business that meets the requirements of section 41-1525, subsection B for a location is eligible to claim first year credits for three years beginning with the taxable year in which those requirements are completed. Employees hired at the location before the beginning of the taxable year but during the twelve-month period allowed in this subsection are considered to be new employees for the taxable year in which all of those requirements are completed.  The employees that are considered to be new employees for the taxable year under this subsection shall not be included in the average number of full-time employees during the immediately preceding taxable year until the taxable year in which all of the requirements of section 41-1525, subsection B are completed. An employee working at a temporary worksite in this state while the designated location is under construction is considered to be working at the designated location if all of the following occur:

1. The employee is hired after the start of the required investment at the designated location.

2. The employee is hired to work at the designated location after it is completed.

3. The payroll for the employees destined for the designated location is segregated from other employees.

4. The employee is moved to the designated location within thirty days after its completion.

D. To qualify for a credit under this section, the taxpayer and the employment positions must meet the requirements prescribed by section 41-1525.

E. A credit is allowed for employment in the second and third year only for qualified employment positions for which a credit was claimed and allowed in the first year.

F. The net increase in the number of qualified employment positions is the lesser of the total number of filled qualified employment positions created at the designated location or locations during the taxable year or the difference between the average number of full-time employees in this state in the current taxable year and the average number of full-time employees in this state during the immediately preceding taxable year.  The net increase in the number of qualified employment positions computed under this subsection may not exceed the difference between the average number of full-time employees in this state in the current taxable year and the average number of full-time employees in this state during the immediately preceding taxable year.

G. If the allowable tax credit exceeds the income taxes otherwise due on the claimant's income, or if there are no state income taxes due on the claimant's income, the amount of the claim not used as an offset against the income taxes may be carried forward as a tax credit against subsequent years' income tax liability for a period not exceeding five taxable years.

H. Co-owners of a business, including corporate partners in a partnership, may each claim only the pro rata share of the credit allowed under this section based on the ownership interest.  The total of the credits allowed all such owners of the business may not exceed the amount that would have been allowed for a sole owner of the business.

I. If the business is sold or changes ownership through reorganization, stock purchase or merger, the new taxpayer may claim first year credits only for the qualified employment positions that it created and filled with an eligible employee after the purchase or reorganization was complete.  If a person purchases a taxpayer that had qualified for first or second year credits or changes ownership through reorganization, stock purchase or merger, the new taxpayer may claim the second or third year credits if it meets other eligibility requirements of this section.  Credits for which a taxpayer qualified before the changes described in this subsection are terminated and lost at the time the changes are implemented.

J. A failure to timely report and certify to the Arizona commerce authority the information prescribed by section 41-1525, subsection E, and in the manner prescribed by section 41-1525, subsection F disqualifies the taxpayer from the credit under this section. The department shall require written evidence of the timely report to the Arizona commerce authority.

K. A tax credit under this section is subject to recovery for a violation described in section 41-1525, subsection H.

L. For the purposes of subsection B, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section, if a full-time employee in the qualified employment position leaves during the taxable year, the employee may be replaced with another new full-time employee in the same employment position and the new employee will be treated as being in the employee's second or third full year of continuous employment for the purposes of the credit under this section if:

1. The total time the position was vacant from the date the employment position was originally filled to the end of the current tax year totals ninety days or less.

2. The new employee meets all of the same requirements as the original employee was required to meet.

#### Section 43-1162. Healthy forest production tax credit; definitions

1. Is equal to at least fifty percent of the amount of the federal low-income housing credit for the qualified project.

2. On notice to the department of revenue, may be allocated among the partners, members or shareholders, as they may agree among themselves regardless of the size of such participant's ownership interest. The total of the allocated credits among all such participants may not exceed the amount of the credit approved by the Arizona department of housing. This paragraph does not prohibit a partner, member or shareholder from holding an investment exclusively in either the state credits or federal credits allocated to the qualified project.

B. To claim the credit under this section, the taxpayer must submit the eligibility statement provided by the Arizona department of housing under section 41-3954 to the department of revenue with the taxpayer's income tax return.

D. If all or part of the federal low-income housing tax credit with respect to the qualified project is subject to recapture under section 42 of the internal revenue code during the first ten taxable years after the project is placed in service, the credit under this section is also subject to recapture in a proportional amount from all taxpayers that claimed the credit.  The recapture is calculated by increasing the amount of taxes imposed in the following year by the amount recaptured.

E. The department of revenue, with the cooperation of the department of insurance and financial institutions and the Arizona department of housing, shall adopt rules and publish and prescribe forms and procedures as necessary to administer this section.

#### Section 43-1164. Credit for solar energy devices; commercial and industrial applications

F. Co-owners of a business, including corporate partners in a partnership, may each claim only the pro rata share of the credit allowed under this section based on the ownership interest or financial investment in the system.  The total of the credits allowed all such owners may not exceed the amount that would have been allowed a sole owner.

F. To be eligible for the credit under this section, the taxpayer must apply to the department, on a form prescribed by the department, for certification of the credit.  The department shall only accept applications beginning January 2 through January 31 of the year following the calendar year for which the credit is being requested.  The application shall include:

1. The name, address and social security number or federal employer identification number of the applicant.

2. The location of the taxpayer's facility that produces electricity using renewable energy resources for which the credit is claimed.

G. The department shall review each application under subsection F of this section and certify to the taxpayer the amount of the credit that is authorized.  The amount of the credit for any calendar year shall not exceed two million dollars per facility that produces electricity using renewable energy resources. Credits are allowed under this section and section 43-1083.02 on a first come, first served basis.  The department shall not authorize tax credits under this section and section 43-1083.02 that exceed in the aggregate a total of twenty million dollars for any calendar year.  The first time that a taxpayer submits a qualified application for a qualified energy generator under subsection F of this section, the  department shall add the taxpayer's name to a credit authorization list that is maintained in the order in which qualified applications are first received by the department on behalf of the qualified energy generator.  A taxpayer's position on the credit authorization list shall be determined in the first year the taxpayer submits an application under subsection F of this section for the qualified energy generator.  The taxpayer's position on the credit authorization list for a particular qualified energy generator shall remain unchanged for the ten years that are specified in subsection B, paragraph 2 of this section or until a year in which the taxpayer fails to submit a timely application under subsection F of this section or otherwise fails to comply with this section. If a taxpayer is removed from the credit authorization list for a qualified energy generator, the taxpayer may establish a new position on the credit authorization list in a subsequent year by filing a timely application for a qualified energy generator that qualifies for the credit.  If an application is received that, if authorized, would require the department to exceed the twenty million dollar limit, the department shall grant the applicant only the remaining credit amount that would not exceed the twenty million dollar limit.  After the department authorizes twenty million dollars in tax credits, the department shall deny any subsequent applications that are received for that calendar year.  The department shall not authorize any additional tax credits that exceed the twenty million dollar limit even if the amounts that have been certified to any taxpayer were not claimed or a taxpayer otherwise fails to meet the requirements to claim the additional credit.

H. Co-owners of a qualified energy generator, including corporate partners in a partnership and members of a limited liability company, may each claim the pro rata share of the credit allowed under this section based on ownership interest.  The total of the credits allowed all such owners of the qualified energy generator may not exceed the amount that would have been allowed for a sole owner of the generator.

I. If the allowable tax credit for a taxpayer exceeds the taxes otherwise due under this title on the claimant's income, or if there are no taxes due under this title, the amount of the claim not used to offset taxes under this title may be carried forward for not more than five consecutive taxable years as a credit against subsequent years' income tax liability.

J. The department shall adopt rules and publish and prescribe forms and procedures as necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.

#### Section 43-1164.04. Credit for qualified facilities

 

(Rpld. 1/1/32)

 

A. For taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2012 through December 31, 2030, a credit is allowed against the taxes imposed by this title for qualifying investment and employment in expanding or locating a qualified facility in this state.  To qualify for the credit, after June 30, 2012 the taxpayer must invest in a new qualified facility or expand an existing qualified facility in this state and produce new full-time employment positions where the job duties are associated with the location of the qualifying investment.  The taxpayer must meet the employee compensation and employee health benefit requirements prescribed by section 41-1512.

B. The amount of the credit is computed as follows:

1. Ten percent of the lesser of:

(a) The total qualifying investment in the qualified facility.

(b) Either:

(i) If the total qualifying investment is less than $2,000,000,000, $200,000 for each net new full-time employment position that has job duties associated with the qualified facility.

(ii) If the total qualifying investment is $2,000,000,000 or more, $300,000 for each net new full-time employment position that has job duties associated with the qualified facility.

2. The amount of the credit shall not exceed the postapproval amount determined by the Arizona commerce authority under section 41-1512, subsection P.

3. Subject to subsections G and J of this section:

(a) The credit amount computed under paragraph 1 of this subsection is apportioned, and the taxpayer shall claim the credit in five equal annual installments in each of five consecutive taxable years.

(b) The taxpayer may claim all five annual installments of a credit that was preapproved before January 1, 2031 by the Arizona commerce authority notwithstanding any intervening repeal or other termination of the credit.

C. To claim the credit the taxpayer must:

1. Conduct a business that qualifies under section 41-1512.

2. Receive preapproval and postapproval from the Arizona commerce authority pursuant to section 41-1512.

3. Submit to the department a copy of a current and valid certification of qualification issued to the taxpayer by the Arizona commerce authority.

D. To be counted for the purposes of the credit, an employee must have been employed with job duties associated with the qualified facility for at least ninety days during the taxable year in a permanent full-time employment position of at least one thousand seven hundred fifty hours per year.  An employee who is hired during the last ninety days of the taxable year shall be considered a new employee during the next taxable year. To be counted for the purposes of the credit during the first taxable year of employment, the employee must not have been previously employed by the taxpayer within twelve months before the current date of hire. The terms of employment must comply in all cases with the requirements of section 41-1512 and be certified by the Arizona commerce authority.

E. Co-owners of a business, including corporate partners in a partnership and members of a limited liability company, may each claim only the pro rata share of the credit allowed under this section based on the ownership interest. The total of the credits allowed all owners of the business may not exceed the amount that would have been allowed for a sole owner of the business.

F. If the allowable tax credit for a taxable year exceeds the income taxes otherwise due on the claimant's income, or if there are no state income taxes due on the claimant's income, the amount of the claim not used as an offset against income taxes shall be paid to the taxpayer in the same manner as a refund under section 42-1118. Refunds made pursuant to this subsection are subject to setoff under section 42-1122. If the department determines that a refund is incorrect or invalid, the excess refund may be treated as a tax deficiency pursuant to section 42-1108.

G. Except as provided by subsection H of this section, if, within five taxable years after first receiving a credit pursuant to this section, the certification of qualification of a business is terminated or revoked under section 41-1512, other than for reasons beyond the control of the business as determined by the Arizona commerce authority, the taxpayer is disqualified from credits under this section in subsequent taxable years.  On a determination that the taxpayer has committed fraud or relocated outside of this state within five taxable years after first receiving a credit pursuant to this section, the credits allowed the taxpayer in all taxable years pursuant to this section are subject to recapture pursuant to this subsection. This subsection applies only in the case of the termination or revocation of a certification of qualification under section 41-1512. This subsection does not apply if, in any taxable year, a taxpayer otherwise does not qualify for or fails to claim the credit under this section. The recapture of credits is computed by increasing the amount of taxes imposed in the year following the year of termination or revocation by the full amount of all credits previously allowed under this section.

H. A taxpayer that claims a credit under section 43-1161 may not claim a credit under this section with respect to the same full-time employment positions.

I. The department of revenue shall adopt rules and prescribe forms and procedures as necessary for the purposes of this section. The department of revenue and the Arizona commerce authority shall collaborate in adopting rules as necessary to avoid duplication and contradictory requirements while accomplishing the intent and purposes of this section.

J. Each taxable year after the postapproval of the credit under section 41-1512, subsection P, when the taxpayer files the taxpayer's income tax return, the taxpayer shall:

1. Notify the department, on a form prescribed by the department, of any full-time employment position for which a credit was claimed under this section and that was vacant for more than one hundred fifty days after the date the full-time employment position was originally filled to the end of that taxable year.  The period that a full-time employment position was vacant may not include the period before the full-time employment position was filled for the first time.

2. Reduce the portion of the credit claimed for the taxable year pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 3 of this section by $4,000 for each full-time employment position reported pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection.

#### Section 43-1164.05. Credit for renewable energy investment and production for self-consumption by international operations centers; definitions

A. A credit is allowed against the taxes imposed by this title for investment in new renewable energy facilities that produce energy for self-consumption using renewable energy resources if the power will be used primarily for an international operations center.

B. The taxpayer is eligible for the credit if all of the following apply:

1. The taxpayer, or a third-party entity on behalf of or for the direct benefit of the taxpayer, invests at least $100,000,000 in one or more new renewable energy facilities in this state that produce energy for self-consumption using renewable energy resources. The minimum investment must be completed within a three-year period beginning on the date the initial application is received or by December 31, 2018, whichever is earlier.

2. A portion of the energy produced at each renewable energy facility is used for self-consumption in this state. By the fifth year a renewable energy facility is in operation, at least fifty-one percent of the energy produced must be used for self-consumption in this state.  Self-consumption includes the power used by related entities if the related entities are directly or indirectly under the same ownership interests that collectively own more than eighty percent. Power that a renewable energy facility transfers to a utility or power generated by a utility-owned renewable energy facility developed on behalf of or for the direct benefit of the taxpayer qualifies as self-consumption if the utility is the same utility that provides power to the owner's international operations center in this state.

3. The power that is used for self-consumption under paragraph 2 of this subsection is used for an international operations center in this state. A lessor of an international operations center facility that uses power for self-consumption under paragraph 2 of this subsection satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the lessee is an international operations center and the power is transferred as part of the lease to the lessee.

C. Subject to subsection F of this section, the credit authorized by this section is $5,000,000 per year for five years for each renewable energy facility. The maximum credit allowed per taxpayer per year is $5,000,000. The taxpayer, including all affiliates of the taxpayer, may not cumulate tax credits under this section over different taxable years exceeding, in the aggregate, $25,000,000. The initial credit for each facility is claimed in the year that the facility becomes operational. A credit, other than carryovers allowed under subsection M of this section, may not be claimed for any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2025. An international operations center that is initially certified pursuant to section 41-1520, subsection C after December 31, 2018 may not claim the tax credit authorized by this section.

D. To qualify as a separate renewable energy facility for the purposes of this section, a facility must be located at least one mile from any other renewable energy facility for which the taxpayer is claiming a credit under this section.

E. To be eligible for the credit under this section, the taxpayer must apply to the department for certification of the credit on a form prescribed by the department.  The application shall include:

1. The name, address and social security number or federal employer identification number of the applicant.

2. An estimate of the total investment the taxpayer will make, including investments made by a third-party entity on behalf of or for the direct benefit of the taxpayer, over a three-year period beginning on the date the application is received, in new renewable energy facilities in this state that produce energy for self-consumption using renewable energy resources. For investments made by a third party, a statement from the utility that provides power to the international operations center affirming that the investment in new renewable energy facilities is made on behalf of or for the direct benefit of the taxpayer satisfies the requirement of this paragraph.

3. The expected location of each of the taxpayer's facilities that comprise the total investment in paragraph 2 of this subsection and the earliest date that each facility is expected to be operational.

4. A statement that the portion of the power generated by each facility, as required by subsection B, paragraph 2 of this section, shall be for self-consumption and shall be used for international operations center use.

5. Any additional information that the department requires.

F. The department shall review each application under subsection E of this section and preapprove the taxpayer for a specified amount of credit that is authorized. Credits are allowed under this section on a first-come, first-served basis. The department may not authorize tax credits under this section that exceed in the aggregate a total of $10,000,000 for any calendar year.  The portion of each year's limit that is reserved for each taxpayer must be based on the year that each credit is expected to be claimed using the dates provided in subsection E, paragraph 3 of this section. If the year a facility is completed is different from the estimated completion date provided in subsection E, paragraph 3 of this section, the taxpayer must amend the application with the new dates. If an application is received that, if authorized, would require the department to exceed the $10,000,000 limit, the department shall grant the applicant only the remaining credit amount that would not exceed the $10,000,000 limit. After the department authorizes $10,000,000 in tax credits, the department shall deny any subsequent applications that are received for that calendar year. The department may not authorize any additional tax credits that exceed the $10,000,000 limit even if the amounts that have been certified to any taxpayer are not claimed or a taxpayer otherwise fails to meet the requirements to claim the additional credit.

G. If a taxpayer fails to start construction within six months after submitting the application under subsection E of this section, the preapproval issued under subsection F of this section is void and all monies reserved from the limits specified in subsection F of this section revert back to the limit for the year for which they were reserved.

H. Each year after initial preapproval, on or before the anniversary date of the application specified in subsection E of this section, the taxpayer must submit to the department:

1. Documentation of the taxpayer's progress toward the investment required by subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section. This documentation is not required after the department receives a report stating that the required investment threshold has been reached.

2. Documentation for each facility that demonstrates that the required portion of the power generated by each renewable energy facility is for self-consumption as required by subsection B, paragraph 2 of this section.

3. If applicable, certification from the Arizona commerce authority pursuant to section 41-1520.

I. The taxpayer must submit a request for final certification to the department within thirty days after each of the renewable energy facilities for which an authorization was given under subsection F of this section becomes operational. Within thirty days after receiving a completed request under this subsection, the department shall review the request and either issue a final certification of the credit to the taxpayer or issue a denial of the credit if it is determined that the requirements of this section have not been met.  Every final certification issued under this subsection must include a facility code issued by the department that is unique to each facility.  To show that the facility has been certified, the taxpayer shall include with the tax return the facility code for each facility for which a credit is claimed. If the taxpayer is the owner or operator of an international operations center, the taxpayer must submit the request for final certification for each of the renewable energy facilities for which capital investment will be claimed towards the required investment threshold and must submit additional evidence to the department within sixty days after the end of the fifth year of operation of each facility that the requirements of subsection B, paragraph 2 of this section have been met.

J. If the taxpayer fails to make the required investment in renewable energy facilities within the time period required by subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section or if the certification of an international operations center has been revoked under section 41-1520 due to a failure to make a $1,250,000,000 investment in the center within ten years after certification or if the taxpayer fails to receive final certification of the credit under subsection I of this section, the taxpayer is not eligible and must cease claiming any further credits under this section and shall reimburse the amount of all credits previously received under this section. The reimbursement must be made on the taxpayer's income tax return for the taxable year in which it is first known that the required investment would not be made within the required time or the taxable year in which the certification was revoked.  The department may give special consideration or allow a temporary exemption from reimbursement if there is extraordinary hardship due to factors beyond the taxpayer's control.  If the reimbursement is due to revocation of the certification of an international operations center due to a failure to invest $1,250,000,000 in the center within ten years after certification, the credits shall be reimbursed in inverse proportion to the total capital investment made in the international operations center divided by $1,250,000,000. The department may require reimbursement before the tenth anniversary of certification of an international operations center if the facility has been closed or relocated or the taxpayer has otherwise demonstrated that the $1,250,000,000 investment will not be timely made. For taxpayers using investments made by third-party entities on behalf of or for the direct benefit of the taxpayer, the investment threshold is $1,500,000,000. A third-party entity may not include the owner or operator of the international operations center or, solely for the purposes of this subsection, the owner's or operator's affiliated entities.

K. If a particular facility ceases to meet the requirements of this section or if the facility is sold, the taxpayer may not claim any future credits related to that facility.

L. Co-owners of a business, including corporate partners in a partnership and corporate members of a limited liability company treated as a partnership, may each claim the pro rata share of the credit allowed under this section based on ownership interest.  Only co-owners that are corporations may claim a share of the credit allowed under this section. The total of the credits allowed all the owners of the business may not exceed the amount that would have been allowed for a sole owner of the business.

M. If the allowable tax credit for a taxpayer exceeds the taxes otherwise due under this title on the claimant's income, or if there are no taxes due under this title, the amount of the claim not used to offset taxes under this title may be carried forward for not more than five consecutive taxable years as a credit against subsequent years' income tax liability.

N. A taxpayer may not claim a credit under this section and section 43-1164.03 regarding the same facilities.

O. The department shall adopt rules and publish and prescribe forms and procedures as necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section.

P. For the purposes of this section:
