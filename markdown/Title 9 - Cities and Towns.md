E. If the municipality has a planning commission, after considering any recommendations from the review required under subsection D of this section, the planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing before approving a general plan or any amendment to such plan. When the general plan or any major amendment is being adopted, planning commissions in municipalities with populations of more than twenty-five thousand persons shall hold two or more public hearings at different locations within the municipality to promote citizen participation.  Notice of the time and place of a hearing and availability of studies and summaries related to the hearing shall be given at least fifteen and not more than thirty calendar days before the hearing by:

H. The adoption or readoption of the general plan or any amendment to such plan shall be by resolution of the governing body of the municipality, after notice as provided for in subsection E of this section. The adoption or readoption of or a major amendment to the general plan shall be approved by affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the governing body of the municipality. All major amendments to the general plan proposed for adoption by the governing body of a municipality shall be presented at a public hearing within twelve months of when the proposal is made. The general plan, or any amendment to the plan, shall be endorsed in the manner provided by the governing body to show that it has been adopted by the governing body. If the municipality includes property in the high noise or accident potential zone of a military airport or ancillary military facility as defined in section 28-8461, the governing body of the municipality shall send notice of the approval, adoption or readoption of the general plan or major amendment to the general plan to the attorney general by certified mail, return receipt requested, within three business days after the approval, adoption or readoption. If the attorney general determines the approval, adoption or readoption of the general plan or major amendment to the general plan is not in compliance with section 28-8481, subsection J, the attorney general shall notify the municipality by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the determination of noncompliance. The municipality shall receive the notice from the attorney general within twenty-five days after the notice from the municipality to the attorney general is mailed pursuant to this subsection. The effective date of any approval, adoption or readoption of, or major amendment to, the general plan shall be thirty days after the governing body's receipt of the attorney general's determination of noncompliance.  Within thirty days after the receipt of a determination of noncompliance by the attorney general as prescribed by this section, the governing body of the municipality shall reconsider any approval, adoption or readoption of, or major amendment to, the general plan that impacts property in the high noise or accident potential zone of a military airport or ancillary military facility as defined in section 28-8461.  If the governing body reaffirms a prior action subject to an attorney general's determination of noncompliance pursuant to this section, the attorney general may institute a civil action pursuant to section 28-8481, subsection L. If the governing body timely sends notice pursuant to this subsection and the attorney general fails to timely notify the governing body of a determination of noncompliance, the general plan or major amendment to the general plan shall be deemed to comply with section 28-8481, subsection J. If the motion to adopt or readopt a general plan or an amendment to the general plan fails to pass, the governing body may reconsider the motion in any manner allowed by the governing body's rules of procedure, but any subsequent motion for the adoption or readoption of the general plan or a major amendment to the general plan must be approved by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the governing body. For the purposes of this subsection, "major amendment" means a substantial alteration of the municipality's land use mixture or balance as established in the municipality's existing general plan land use element. The municipality's general plan shall define the criteria to determine if a proposed amendment to the general plan effects a substantial alteration of the municipality's land use mixture or balance as established in the municipality's existing general plan land use element.

I. If the municipality does not have a planning commission, the only procedural steps required for the adoption of the general plan, or any amendment to such plan, shall be those provided in this article for action by the governing body.

J. A copy of the adopted general plan of a municipality shall be sent to the planning agency of the county within which the municipality is located, and such plan or any portion of the plan may be adopted as a part of the county general plan.

K. A general plan, with any amendments, is effective for up to ten years after the date the plan was initially adopted and ratified pursuant to subsection M of this section, or until the plan is readopted pursuant to this subsection and ratified pursuant to subsection M of this section or a new plan is adopted pursuant to this subsection and ratified pursuant to subsection M of this section, and becomes effective. On or before the tenth anniversary of the plan's most recent adoption, the governing body of the municipality shall either readopt the existing plan for an additional term of up to ten years or shall adopt a new general plan as provided by this article.

L. Except for general plans that are required to be submitted to the voters for ratification pursuant to subsection M of this section, the adoption or readoption of a general plan, and any amendment to a general plan, shall not be enacted as an emergency measure and is subject to referendum as provided by article IV, part 1, section 1, subsection (8), Constitution of Arizona, and title 19, chapter 1, article 4.

The governing body shall either resubmit the proposed new plan, or revise the new plan as provided by this section, for subsequent submission to the voters at the next regularly scheduled municipal election or at a special election scheduled at least one hundred twenty days after the governing body readopted the new or revised new plan.  All subsequent adoptions and submissions of the new plan or revised plans must comply with the procedures prescribed by this section until the plan is ratified.

N. In applying an open space element or a growth element of a general plan, a municipality shall not designate private land or state trust land as open space, recreation, conservation or agriculture unless the municipality receives the written consent of the landowner or provides an alternative, economically viable designation in the general plan or zoning ordinance, allowing at least one residential dwelling per acre.  If the landowner is the prevailing party in any action brought to enforce this subsection, a court shall award fees and other expenses to the landowner. A municipality may designate land as open space without complying with the requirements of this subsection if the land was zoned as open space and used as a golf course pursuant to a zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to article 6.1 of this chapter before May 1, 2000 and the designation does not impose additional conditions, limitations or restrictions on the golf course, unless the land is state trust land that was not planned and zoned as open space pursuant to title 37, chapter 2, article 5.1.

O. A person, after having participated in the public hearing pursuant to subsection H of this section, may file a petition for special action in superior court to review the governing body's decision that does not comply with the mandatory requirement prescribed in section 9-461.05, subsection C, paragraph 1, subdivision (g) within thirty days after the governing body has rendered its decision. The court may affirm, reverse or remand to the governing body, in whole or in part, the decision reviewed for further action that is necessary to comply with the mandatory requirements prescribed in section 9-461.05, subsection C, paragraph 1, subdivision (g).

#### Section 9-461.11. Extraterritorial jurisdiction; development plans

A. In any county not having a county planning agency with jurisdiction in the unincorporated territory, the legislative body of any municipality may exercise the planning powers granted in this article both to territory within its corporate limits and to that which extends a distance of three contiguous miles in all directions of its corporate limits and is not located in a municipality. Any ordinance intended to have application beyond the corporate limits of the municipality shall expressly state the intention of such applications. Such ordinance shall be adopted in accordance with the provisions set forth therein.

B. In addition to the requirements of subsection A of this section, a city or town shall annually post on its website a capital improvement plan containing all public works projects scheduled to be constructed.  For a city or town without a website, the information shall be posted on the website operated by an association of cities and towns in this state.  A utility may also request that the city or town annually provide a copy of the city or town's capital improvement plan and provide notice of any new projects not included in the plan or changes that advance the start date of any projects already in the plan.  The utility shall designate the utility representative to receive the plan and any notice of changes that would add new projects or advance the start date of any projects already in the plan.

C. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Public works project" has the same meaning prescribed in section 12-1141.

#### Section 9-461.15. Requirement of planned community prohibited

A. The planning agency of a municipality in exercising its authority pursuant to this title shall not require as part of a subdivision regulation or zoning ordinance that a subdivider or developer establish an association as defined in section 33-1802.

B. A municipality may require a subdivider or developer to establish an association to maintain private, common or community owned improvements that are approved and installed as part of a preliminary plat, final plat or specific plan. A municipality shall not require that an association be formed or operated other than for the maintenance of common areas or community owned property. This subsection applies only to planned communities that are established in plats recorded after the effective date of this section.

B. If the telecommunications utility has existing land rights, the municipality shall provide at the municipality's expense the telecommunications utility with equal land rights in the new location of the relocated facilities. If the telecommunications utility's existing facilities are located in the right-of-way under a permit, the municipality shall provide at the municipality's expense the telecommunications utility with rights in the new location of the relocated facilities equivalent to the telecommunications utility's existing rights under the permit.

C. A telecommunications utility shall submit a verified itemized claim to the municipality for reimbursement of relocation costs within one hundred eighty days after each calendar quarter in which a telecommunications utility incurs relocation costs.

D. The municipality shall:

1. Review each verified itemized claim submitted pursuant to subsection C of this section. The review may include an audit conducted pursuant to standard industry accounting principles.

2. Reimburse the telecommunications utility for the relocation costs within ninety days after receipt of the verified itemized claim.

3. Reimburse verified itemized claims from all affected telecommunications utilities in the order of receipt.

E.

The total of the project monies is the total dollar amount of all voter-approved municipal bond proceeds that fund a construction project from time to time.

F. The total amount of reimbursement paid for claims of relocation costs of all telecommunications utility facilities for which there are no existing land rights may not exceed the reimbursement limitation.

G. If a verified itemized claim causes the total amount of all claims for telecommunications utility relocation costs to exceed the reimbursement limitation, that claim shall be reduced so that the total amount of reimbursement paid for all claims for which there are no existing land rights equals the reimbursement limitation.

H. If the dollar amount of the reimbursement limitation increases as a result of an increase in total project funds after the previous reimbursement limitation is exhausted, within thirty days after the reimbursement limitation is increased the municipality shall resume processing previously submitted and new verified itemized claims under this section.

I. The reimbursement limitation does not apply to any claims for reimbursement of relocation costs for telecommunications utility facilities with existing land rights or any amounts paid by the municipality to provide equivalent land or permit rights.  These claims and amounts are excluded from the reimbursement limitation.

J. This section does not:

1. Apply to a construction project funded in whole or in part with voter-approved municipal bond proceeds if approval of the bonds was referred to the voters, or the initiative petition for the bonds was applied for, before January 1, 2017.

2. Prohibit a municipality from complying with other applicable law, or with an agreement, that requires the municipality to reimburse a telecommunications utility for more relocation costs than this section provides.

1. "Intergovernmental contract" means the joint exercise of powers authorized by title 11, chapter 7, article 3.

2. "Municipality" includes a charter city.

3. "Relocation costs" means all costs of relocating a telecommunications utility's facilities that the telecommunications utility incurs as a direct result of the construction and operation of a construction project.  Relocation costs do not include profit but may include a reasonable allocation of general overhead expenses.

6. Require the dedication of public streets, sewer and water utility easements or rights-of-way, within the proposed subdivision.

7. Require the preparation and submission of acceptable engineering plans and specifications for the installation of required street, sewer, electric and water utilities, drainage, flood control, adequacy of water and improvements as a condition precedent to recordation of an approved final plat.

8. Require the posting of performance bonds, assurances or such other security as may be appropriate and necessary to assure the installation of required street, sewer, electric and water utilities, drainage, flood control and improvements meeting established minimum standards of design and construction.

D. The legislative body of any municipality may require by ordinance that land areas within a subdivision be reserved for parks, recreational facilities, school sites and fire stations subject to the following conditions:

1. The requirement may only be made upon preliminary plats filed at least thirty days after the adoption of a general or specific plan affecting the land area to be reserved.

2. The required reservations are in accordance with definite principles and standards adopted by the legislative body.

3. The land area reserved shall be of such a size and shape as to permit the remainder of the land area of the subdivision within which the reservation is located to develop in an orderly and efficient manner.

4. The land area reserved shall be in such multiples of streets and parcels as to permit an efficient division of the reserved area in the event that it is not acquired within the prescribed period.

E. The public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved shall have a period of one year after recording the final subdivision plat to enter into an agreement to acquire such reserved land area. The purchase price shall be the fair market value of the reserved land area at the time of the filing of the preliminary subdivision plat plus the taxes against such reserved area from the date of the reservation and any other costs incurred by the subdivider in the maintenance of such reserved area, including the interest cost incurred on any loan covering such reserved area.

F. If the public agency for whose benefit an area has been reserved does not exercise the reservation agreement set forth in subsection E of this section within such one year period or such extended period as may be mutually agreed upon by such public agency and the subdivider, the reservation of such area shall terminate.

G. The legislative body of every municipality shall comply with this article and applicable state statutes pertaining to the hearing, approval or rejection, and recordation of:

2. Rules as may be established by a county flood control district relating to the construction or prevention of construction of streets in land established as being subject to periodic inundation.

3. Rules as may be established by the department of health services or a county health department relating to the provision of domestic water supply and sanitary sewage disposal.

I. If the subdivision is comprised of subdivided lands, as defined in section 32-2101, and is within an active management area, as defined in section 45-402, the final plat shall not be approved unless it is accompanied by a certificate of assured water supply issued by the director of water resources, or unless the subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an assured water supply by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-576 or is exempt from the requirement pursuant to section 45-576. The legislative body of the municipality shall note on the face of the final plat that a certificate of assured water supply has been submitted with the plat or that the subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the proposed subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an assured water supply, pursuant to section 45-576, or is exempt from the requirement pursuant to section 45-576.

J. Except as provided in subsections K and P of this section, if the subdivision is composed of subdivided lands as defined in section 32-2101 outside of an active management area and the director of water resources has given written notice to the municipality pursuant to section 45-108, subsection H, the final plat shall not be approved unless one of the following applies:

1. The director of water resources has determined that there is an adequate water supply for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108 and the subdivider has included the report with the plat.

2. The subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an adequate water supply by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-108.

K. The legislative body of a municipality that has received written notice from the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-108, subsection H or that has adopted an ordinance pursuant to subsection O of this section may provide by ordinance an exemption from the requirement in subsection J or O of this section for a subdivision that the director of water resources has determined will have an inadequate water supply because the water supply will be transported to the subdivision by motor vehicle or train if all of the following apply:

1. The legislative body determines that there is no feasible alternative water supply for the subdivision and that the transportation of water to the subdivision will not constitute a significant risk to the health and safety of the residents of the subdivision.

2. If the water to be transported to the subdivision will be withdrawn or diverted in the service area of a municipal provider as defined in section 45-561, the municipal provider has consented to the withdrawal or diversion.

3. If the water to be transported is groundwater, the transportation complies with the provisions governing the transportation of groundwater in title 45, chapter 2, article 8.

4. The transportation of water to the subdivision meets any additional conditions imposed by the legislative body.

L. A municipality that adopts the exemption authorized by subsection K of this section shall give written notice of the adoption of the exemption, including a certified copy of the ordinance containing the exemption, to the director of water resources, the director of environmental quality and the state real estate commissioner.  If the municipality later rescinds the exemption, the municipality shall give written notice of the rescission to the director of water resources, the director of environmental quality and the state real estate commissioner. A municipality that rescinds an exemption adopted pursuant to subsection K of this section shall not readopt the exemption for at least five years after the rescission becomes effective.

M. If the legislative body of a municipality approves a subdivision plat pursuant to subsection J, paragraph 1 or 2 or subsection O of this section, the legislative body shall note on the face of the plat that the director of water resources has reported that the subdivision has an adequate water supply or that the subdivider has obtained a commitment of water service for the proposed subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an adequate water supply pursuant to section 45-108.

N. If the legislative body of a municipality approves a subdivision plat pursuant to an exemption authorized by subsection K of this section or granted by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-108.02 or 45-108.03:

1. The legislative body shall give written notice of the approval to the director of water resources and the director of environmental quality.

2. The legislative body shall include on the face of the plat a statement that the director of water resources has determined that the water supply for the subdivision is inadequate and a statement describing the exemption under which the plat was approved, including a statement that the legislative body or the director of water resources, whichever applies, has determined that the specific conditions of the exemption were met.  If the director subsequently informs the legislative body that the subdivision is being served by a water provider that has been designated by the director as having an adequate water supply pursuant to section 45-108, the legislative body shall record in the county recorder's office a statement disclosing that fact.

O. If a municipality has not been given written notice by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-108, subsection H, the legislative body of the municipality, to protect the public health and safety, may provide by ordinance that, except as provided in subsections K and P of this section, the final plat of a subdivision located in the municipality and outside of an active management area will not be approved by the legislative body unless the director of water resources has determined that there is an adequate water supply for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108 or the subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an adequate water supply by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-108.  Before holding a public hearing to consider whether to enact an ordinance pursuant to this subsection, a municipality shall provide written notice of the hearing to the board of supervisors of the county in which the municipality is located.  A municipality that enacts an ordinance pursuant to this subsection shall give written notice of the enactment of the ordinance, including a certified copy of the ordinance, to the director of water resources, the director of environmental quality, the state real estate commissioner and the board of supervisors of the county in which the municipality is located.  If a municipality enacts an ordinance pursuant to this subsection, water providers may be eligible to receive monies in a water supply development fund, as otherwise provided by law.

P. Subsections J and O of this section do not apply to:

1. A proposed subdivision that the director of water resources has determined will have an inadequate water supply pursuant to section 45-108 if the director grants an exemption for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108.02 and the exemption has not expired or if the director grants an exemption pursuant to section 45-108.03.

2. A proposed subdivision that received final plat approval from the municipality before the requirement for an adequate water supply became effective in the municipality if the plat has not been materially changed since it received the final plat approval.  If changes were made to the plat after the plat received the final plat approval, the director of water resources shall determine whether the changes are material pursuant to the rules adopted by the director to implement section 45-108. If the municipality approves a plat pursuant to this paragraph and the director of water resources has determined that there is an inadequate water supply for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108, the municipality shall note this on the face of the plat.

Q. If the subdivision is composed of subdivided lands as defined in section 32-2101 outside of an active management area and the municipality has not received written notice pursuant to section 45-108, subsection H and has not adopted an ordinance pursuant to subsection O of this section:

1. If the director of water resources has determined that there is an adequate water supply for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108 or if the subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an adequate water supply by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-108, the municipality shall note this on the face of the plat if the plat is approved.

2. If the director of water resources has determined that there is an inadequate water supply for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108, the municipality shall note this on the face of the plat if the plat is approved.

R. Every municipality is responsible for the recordation of all final plats approved by the legislative body and shall receive from the subdivider and transmit to the county recorder the recordation fee established by the county recorder.

S. Pursuant to provisions of applicable state statutes, the legislative body of any municipality may itself prepare or have prepared a plat for the subdivision of land under municipal ownership.

T. The legislative bodies of cities and towns may regulate by ordinance land splits within their corporate limits. Authority granted under this section refers to the determination of division lines, area and shape of the tracts or parcels and does not include authority to regulate the terms or condition of the sale or lease nor does it include the authority to regulate the sale or lease of tracts or parcels that are not the result of land splits as defined in section 9-463.

U. For any subdivision that consists of ten or fewer lots, tracts or parcels, each of which is of a size as prescribed by the legislative body, the legislative body of each municipality may expedite the processing of or  waive the requirement to prepare, submit and receive approval of a preliminary plat as a condition precedent to submitting a final plat and may waive or reduce infrastructure standards or requirements proportional to the impact of the subdivision. Requirements for dust-controlled access and drainage improvements shall not be waived.

#### Section 9-463.02. Subdivision defined; applicability

A. "Subdivision" means improved or unimproved land or lands divided for the purpose of financing, sale or lease, whether immediate or future, into four or more lots, tracts or parcels of land, or, if a new street is involved, any such property which is divided into two or more lots, tracts or parcels of land, or, any such property, the boundaries of which have been fixed by a recorded plat, which is divided into more than two parts. "Subdivision" also includes any condominium, cooperative, community apartment, townhouse or similar project containing four or more parcels, in which an undivided interest in the land is coupled with the right of exclusive occupancy of any unit located thereon, but plats of such projects need not show the buildings or the manner in which the buildings or airspace above the property shown on the plat are to be divided.

B. The legislative body of a municipality shall not refuse approval of a final plat of a project included in subsection A under provisions of an adopted subdivision regulation because of location of buildings on the property shown on the plat not in violation of such subdivision regulations or on account of the manner in which airspace is to be divided in conveying the condominium. Fees and lot design requirements shall be computed and imposed with respect to such plats on the basis of parcels or lots on the surface of the land shown thereon as included in the project. This subsection does not limit the power of such legislative body to regulate the location of buildings in such a project by or pursuant to a zoning ordinance.

C. "Subdivision" does not include the following:

1. The sale or exchange of parcels of land to or between adjoining property owners if such sale or exchange does not create additional lots.

2. The partitioning of land in accordance with other statutes regulating the partitioning of land held in common ownership.

3. The leasing of apartments, offices, stores or similar space within a building or trailer park, nor to mineral, oil or gas leases.

#### Section 9-463.03. Violations

It is unlawful for any person to offer to sell or lease, to contract to sell or lease or to sell or lease any subdivision or part thereof until a final plat thereof, in full compliance with provisions of this article and of any subdivision regulations which have been duly recorded in the office of recorder of the county in which the subdivision or any portion thereof is located, is recorded in the office of the recorder, except that this shall not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in compliance with any law or subdivision regulation regulating the subdivision plat design and improvement of subdivisions in effect at the time the subdivision was established. The county recorder shall not record a plat located in a municipality having subdivision regulations enacted under this article unless the plat has been approved by the legislative body of the municipality.

#### Section 9-463.04. Extraterritorial jurisdiction

A. In any county not having county subdivision regulations applicable to the unincorporated territory, the legislative body of any municipality may exercise the subdivision regulation powers granted in this article both to territory within its corporate limits and to that which extends a distance of three contiguous miles in all directions of its corporate limits and not located in a municipality. Any ordinance intended to have application beyond the corporate limits of the municipality shall expressly state the intention of such application. Such ordinance shall be adopted in accordance with the provisions set forth therein.

B. The extraterritorial jurisdiction of two or more municipalities whose territorial boundaries are less than six miles apart terminates at a boundary line equidistant from the respective corporate limits of such municipalities, or at such line as is agreed to by the legislative bodies of the respective municipalities.

C. As a prerequisite to the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the membership of the planning agency charged with the preparation or administration of proposed subdivision regulations for the area of extraterritorial jurisdiction shall be increased to include two additional members to represent the unincorporated area. Any additional member shall be a resident of the three mile area outside the corporate limits and be appointed by the legislative body of the county in which the unincorporated area is situated. Any such member shall have equal rights, privileges and duties with the other members of the planning agency in all matters pertaining to the plans and regulations of the unincorporated area in which they reside, both in preparation of the original plans and regulations and in consideration of any proposed amendments to such plans and regulations.

D. Any municipal legislative body exercising the powers granted by this section may provide for the enforcement of its regulations for the area of extraterritorial jurisdiction in the same manner as the regulations for the area within the municipality are enforced.

#### Section 9-463.05. Development fees; imposition by cities and towns; infrastructure improvements plan; annual report; advisory committee; limitation on actions; definitions

A. A municipality may assess development fees to offset costs to the municipality associated with providing necessary public services to a development, including the costs of infrastructure, improvements, real property, engineering and architectural services, financing and professional services required for the preparation or revision of a development fee pursuant to this section, including the relevant portion of the infrastructure improvements plan.

B. Development fees assessed by a municipality under this section are subject to the following requirements:

1. Development fees shall result in a beneficial use to the development.

2. The municipality shall calculate the development fee based on the infrastructure improvements plan adopted pursuant to this section.

3. The development fee shall not exceed a proportionate share of the cost of necessary public services, based on service units, needed to provide necessary public services to the development.

4. Costs for necessary public services made necessary by new development shall be based on the same level of service provided to existing development in the service area.

5. Development fees may not be used for any of the following:

(a) Construction, acquisition or expansion of public facilities or assets other than necessary public services or facility expansions identified in the infrastructure improvements plan.

(b) Repair, operation or maintenance of existing or new necessary public services or facility expansions.

(c) Upgrading, updating, expanding, correcting or replacing existing necessary public services to serve existing development in order to meet stricter safety, efficiency, environmental or regulatory standards.

(d) Upgrading, updating, expanding, correcting or replacing existing necessary public services to provide a higher level of service to existing development.

(e) Administrative, maintenance or operating costs of the municipality.

6. Any development for which a development fee has been paid is entitled to the use and benefit of the services for which the fee was imposed and is entitled to receive immediate service from any existing facility with available capacity to serve the new service units if the available capacity has not been reserved or pledged in connection with the construction or financing of the facility.

7. Development fees may be collected if any of the following occurs:

(a) The collection is made to pay for a necessary public service or facility expansion that is identified in the infrastructure improvements plan and the municipality plans to complete construction and to have the service available within the time period established in the infrastructure improvement plan, but in no event longer than the time period provided in subsection H, paragraph 3 of this section.

(b) The municipality reserves in the infrastructure improvements plan adopted pursuant to this section or otherwise agrees to reserve capacity to serve future development.

(c) The municipality requires or agrees to allow the owner of a development to construct or finance the necessary public service or facility expansion and any of the following apply:

(i) The costs incurred or money advanced are credited against or reimbursed from the development fees otherwise due from a development.

(ii) The municipality reimburses the owner for those costs from the development fees paid from all developments that will use those necessary public services or facility expansions.

(iii) For those costs incurred the municipality allows the owner to assign the credits or reimbursement rights from the development fees otherwise due from a development to other developments for the same category of necessary public services in the same service area.

8. Projected interest charges and other finance costs may be included in determining the amount of development fees only if the monies are used for the payment of principal and interest on the portion of the bonds, notes or other obligations issued to finance construction of necessary public services or facility expansions identified in the infrastructure improvements plan.

9. Monies received from development fees assessed pursuant to this section shall be placed in a separate fund and accounted for separately and may only be used for the purposes authorized by this section. Monies received from a development fee identified in an infrastructure improvements plan adopted or updated pursuant to subsection D of this section shall be used to provide the same category of necessary public services or facility expansions for which the development fee was assessed and for the benefit of the same service area, as defined in the infrastructure improvements plan, in which the development fee was assessed.  Interest earned on monies in the separate fund shall be credited to the fund.

10. The schedule for payment of fees shall be provided by the municipality. Based on the cost identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, the municipality shall provide a credit toward the payment of a development fee for the required or agreed to dedication of public sites, improvements and other necessary public services or facility expansions included in the infrastructure improvements plan and for which a development fee is assessed, to the extent the public sites, improvements and necessary public services or facility expansions are provided by the developer. The developer of residential dwelling units shall be required to pay development fees when construction permits for the dwelling units are issued, or at a later time if specified in a development agreement pursuant to section 9-500.05.  If a development agreement provides for fees to be paid at a time later than the issuance of construction permits, the deferred fees shall be paid no later than fifteen days after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.  The development agreement shall provide for the value of any deferred fees to be supported by appropriate security, including a surety bond, letter of credit or cash bond.

11. If a municipality requires as a condition of development approval the construction or improvement of, contributions to or dedication of any facilities that were not included in a previously adopted infrastructure improvements plan, the municipality shall cause the infrastructure improvements plan to be amended to include the facilities and shall provide a credit toward the payment of a development fee for the construction, improvement, contribution or dedication of the facilities to the extent that the facilities will substitute for or otherwise reduce the need for other similar facilities in the infrastructure improvements plan for which development fees were assessed.

12. The municipality shall forecast the contribution to be made in the future in cash or by taxes, fees, assessments or other sources of revenue derived from the property owner towards the capital costs of the necessary public service covered by the development fee and shall include these contributions in determining the extent of the burden imposed by the development. Beginning August 1, 2014, for purposes of calculating the required offset to development fees pursuant to this subsection, if a municipality imposes a construction contracting or similar excise tax rate in excess of the percentage amount of the transaction privilege tax rate imposed on the majority of other transaction privilege tax classifications, the entire excess portion of the construction contracting or similar excise tax shall be treated as a contribution to the capital costs of necessary public services provided to development for which development fees are assessed, unless the excess portion was already taken into account for such purpose pursuant to this subsection.

13. If development fees are assessed by a municipality, the fees shall be assessed against commercial, residential and industrial development, except that the municipality may distinguish between different categories of residential, commercial and industrial development in assessing the costs to the municipality of providing necessary public services to new development and in determining the amount of the development fee applicable to the category of development.  If a municipality agrees to waive any of the development fees assessed on a development, the municipality shall reimburse the appropriate development fee accounts for the amount that was waived. The municipality shall provide notice of any such waiver to the advisory committee established pursuant to subsection G of this section within thirty days.

14. In determining and assessing a development fee applying to land in a community facilities district established under title 48, chapter 4, article 6, the municipality shall take into account all public infrastructure provided by the district and capital costs paid by the district for necessary public services and shall not assess a portion of the development fee based on the infrastructure or costs.

C. A municipality shall give at least thirty days' advance notice of intention to assess a development fee and shall release to the public and post on its website or the website of an association of cities and towns if a municipality does not have a website a written report of the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan adopted pursuant to subsection D of this section.  The municipality shall conduct a public hearing on the proposed development fee at any time after the expiration of the thirty day notice of intention to assess a development fee and at least thirty days before the scheduled date of adoption of the fee by the governing body. Within sixty days after the date of the public hearing on the proposed development fee, a municipality shall approve or disapprove the imposition of the development fee. A municipality shall not adopt an ordinance, order or resolution approving a development fee as an emergency measure. A development fee assessed pursuant to this section shall not be effective until seventy-five days after its formal adoption by the governing body of the municipality. Nothing in this subsection shall affect any development fee adopted before July 24, 1982.

D. Before the adoption or amendment of a development fee, the governing body of the municipality shall adopt or update the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan for the designated service area. The municipality shall conduct a public hearing on the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan at least thirty days before the adoption or update of the plan.  The municipality shall release the plan to the public, post the plan on its website or the website of an association of cities and towns if the municipality does not have a website, including in the posting its land use assumptions, the time period of the projections, a description of the necessary public services included in the infrastructure improvements plan and a map of the service area to which the land use assumptions apply, make available to the public the documents used to prepare the assumptions and plan and provide public notice at least sixty days before the public hearing, subject to the following:

1. The land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan shall be approved or disapproved within sixty days after the public hearing on the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan and at least thirty days before the public hearing on the report required by subsection C of this section.  A municipality shall not adopt an ordinance, order or resolution approving the land use assumptions or infrastructure improvements plan as an emergency measure.

2. An infrastructure improvements plan shall be developed by qualified professionals using generally accepted engineering and planning practices pursuant to subsection E of this section.

3. A municipality shall update the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan at least every five years. The initial five year period begins on the day the infrastructure improvements plan is adopted.  The municipality shall review and evaluate its current land use assumptions and shall cause an update of the infrastructure improvements plan to be prepared pursuant to this section.

4. Within sixty days after completion of the updated land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan, the municipality shall schedule and provide notice of a public hearing to discuss and review the update and shall determine whether to amend the assumptions and plan.

5. A municipality shall hold a public hearing to discuss the proposed amendments to the land use assumptions, the infrastructure improvements plan or the development fee.  The land use assumptions and the infrastructure improvements plan, including the amount of any proposed changes to the development fee per service unit, shall be made available to the public on or before the date of the first publication of the notice of the hearing on the amendments.

6. The notice and hearing procedures prescribed in paragraph 1 of this subsection apply to a hearing on the amendment of land use assumptions, an infrastructure improvements plan or a development fee. Within sixty days after the date of the public hearing on the amendments, a municipality shall approve or disapprove the amendments to the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fee.  A municipality shall not adopt an ordinance, order or resolution approving the amended land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fee as an emergency measure.

7. The advisory committee established under subsection G of this section shall file its written comments on any proposed or updated land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development fees before the fifth business day before the date of the public hearing on the proposed or updated assumptions, plan and fees.

8. If, at the time an update as prescribed in paragraph 3 of this subsection is required, the municipality determines that no changes to the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fees are needed, the municipality may as an alternative to the updating requirements of this subsection publish notice of its determination on its website and include the following:

(a) A statement that the municipality has determined that no change to the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fee is necessary.

(b) A description and map of the service area in which an update has been determined to be unnecessary.

(c) A statement that by a specified date, which shall be at least sixty days after the date of publication of the first notice, a person may make a written request to the municipality requesting that the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fee be updated.

(d) A statement identifying the person or entity to whom the written request for an update should be sent.

9. If, by the date specified pursuant to paragraph 8 of this subsection, a person requests in writing that the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fee be updated, the municipality shall cause, accept or reject an update of the assumptions and plan to be prepared pursuant to this subsection.

10. Notwithstanding the notice and hearing requirements for adoption of an infrastructure improvements plan, a municipality may amend an infrastructure improvements plan adopted pursuant to this section without a public hearing if the amendment addresses only elements of necessary public services in the existing infrastructure improvements plan and the changes to the plan will not, individually or cumulatively with other amendments adopted pursuant to this subsection, increase the level of service in the service area or cause a development fee increase of greater than five per cent when a new or modified development fee is assessed pursuant to this section.  The municipality shall provide notice of any such amendment at least thirty days before adoption, shall post the amendment on its website or on the website of an association of cities and towns if the municipality does not have a website and shall provide notice to the advisory committee established pursuant to subsection G of this section that the amendment complies with this subsection.

E. For each necessary public service that is the subject of a development fee, the infrastructure improvements plan shall include:

1. A description of the existing necessary public services in the service area and the costs to upgrade, update, improve, expand, correct or replace those necessary public services to meet existing needs and usage and stricter safety, efficiency, environmental or regulatory standards, which shall be prepared by qualified professionals licensed in this state, as applicable.

2. An analysis of the total capacity, the level of current usage and commitments for usage of capacity of the existing necessary public services, which shall be prepared by qualified professionals licensed in this state, as applicable.

3. A description of all or the parts of the necessary public services or facility expansions and their costs necessitated by and attributable to development in the service area based on the approved land use assumptions, including a forecast of the costs of infrastructure, improvements, real property, financing, engineering and architectural services, which shall be prepared by qualified professionals licensed in this state, as applicable.

4. A table establishing the specific level or quantity of use, consumption, generation or discharge of a service unit for each category of necessary public services or facility expansions and an equivalency or conversion table establishing the ratio of a service unit to various types of land uses, including residential, commercial and industrial.

5. The total number of projected service units necessitated by and attributable to new development in the service area based on the approved land use assumptions and calculated pursuant to generally accepted engineering and planning criteria.

6. The projected demand for necessary public services or facility expansions required by new service units for a period not to exceed ten years.

7. A forecast of revenues generated by new service units other than development fees, which shall include estimated state-shared revenue, highway users revenue, federal revenue, ad valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based on the approved land use assumptions, and a plan to include these contributions in determining the extent of the burden imposed by the development as required in subsection B, paragraph 12 of this section.

F. A municipality's development fee ordinance shall provide that a new development fee or an increased portion of a modified development fee shall not be assessed against a development for twenty-four months after the date that the municipality issues the final approval for a commercial, industrial or multifamily development or the date that the first building permit is issued for a residential development pursuant to an approved site plan or subdivision plat, provided that no subsequent changes are made to the approved site plan or subdivision plat that would increase the number of service units. If the number of service units increases, the new or increased portion of a modified development fee shall be limited to the amount attributable to the additional service units.  The twenty-four month period shall not be extended by a renewal or amendment of the site plan or the final subdivision plat that was the subject of the final approval.  The municipality shall issue, on request, a written statement of the development fee schedule applicable to the development.  If, after the date of the municipality's final approval of a development, the municipality reduces the development fee assessed on development, the reduced fee shall apply to the development.

G. A municipality shall do one of the following:

1. Before the adoption of proposed or updated land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development fees as prescribed in subsection D of this section, the municipality shall appoint an infrastructure improvements advisory committee, subject to the following requirements:

(a) The advisory committee shall be composed of at least five members who are appointed by the governing body of the municipality.  At least fifty per cent of the members of the advisory committee must be representatives of the real estate, development or building industries, of which at least one member of the committee must be from the home building industry.

2. In lieu of creating an advisory committee pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection, provide for a biennial certified audit of the municipality's land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development fees.  An audit pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted by one or more qualified professionals who are not employees or officials of the municipality and who did not prepare the infrastructure improvements plan.  The audit shall review the progress of the infrastructure improvements plan, including the collection and expenditures of development fees for each project in the plan, and evaluate any inequities in implementing the plan or imposing the development fee.  The municipality shall post the findings of the audit on the municipality's website or the website of an association of cities and towns if the municipality does not have a website and shall conduct a public hearing on the audit within sixty days of the release of the audit to the public.

H. On written request, an owner of real property for which a development fee has been paid after July 31, 2014 is entitled to a refund of a development fee or any part of a development fee if:

1. Pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 6 of this section, existing facilities are available and service is not provided.

2. The municipality has, after collecting the fee to construct a facility when service is not available, failed to complete construction within the time period identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, but in no event later than the time period specified in paragraph 3 of this subsection.

3. For a development fee other than a development fee for water or wastewater facilities, any part of the development fee is not spent as authorized by this section within ten years after the fee has been paid or, for a development fee for water or wastewater facilities, any part of the development fee is not spent as authorized by this section within fifteen years after the fee has been paid.

I. If the development fee was collected for the construction of all or a portion of a specific item of infrastructure, and on completion of the infrastructure the municipality determines that the actual cost of construction was less than the forecasted cost of construction on which the development fee was based and the difference between the actual and estimated cost is greater than ten per cent, the current owner may receive a refund of the portion of the development fee equal to the difference between the development fee paid and the development fee that would have been due if the development fee had been calculated at the actual construction cost.

J. A refund shall include any interest earned by the municipality from the date of collection to the date of refund on the amount of the refunded fee.  All refunds shall be made to the record owner of the property at the time the refund is paid.  If the development fee is paid by a governmental entity, the refund shall be paid to the governmental entity.

K. A development fee that was adopted before January 1, 2012 may continue to be assessed only to the extent that it will be used to provide a necessary public service for which development fees can be assessed pursuant to this section and shall be replaced by a development fee imposed under this section on or before August 1, 2014.  Any municipality having a development fee that has not been replaced under this section on or before August 1, 2014 shall not collect development fees until the development fee has been replaced with a fee that complies with this section.  Any development fee monies collected before January 1, 2012 remaining in a development fee account:

1. Shall be used towards the same category of necessary public services as authorized by this section.

2. If development fees were collected for a purpose not authorized by this section, shall be used for the purpose for which they were collected on or before January 1, 2020, and after which, if not spent, shall be distributed equally among the categories of necessary public services authorized by this section.

L. A moratorium shall not be placed on development for the sole purpose of awaiting completion of all or any part of the process necessary to develop, adopt or update development fees.

M. In any judicial action interpreting this section, all powers conferred on municipal governments in this section shall be narrowly construed to ensure that development fees are not used to impose on new residents a burden all taxpayers of a municipality should bear equally.

N. Each municipality that assesses development fees shall submit an annual report accounting for the collection and use of the fees for each service area.  The annual report shall include the following:

1. The amount assessed by the municipality for each type of development fee.

2. The balance of each fund maintained for each type of development fee assessed as of the beginning and end of the fiscal year.

3. The amount of interest or other earnings on the monies in each fund as of the end of the fiscal year.

4. The amount of development fee monies used to repay:

Within ninety days following the end of each fiscal year, each municipality shall submit a copy of the annual report to the city clerk and post the report on the municipality's website or the website of an association of cities and towns if the municipality does not have a website. Copies shall be made available to the public on request.  The annual report may contain financial information that has not been audited.

P. A municipality that fails to file the report and post the report on the municipality's website or the website of an association of cities and towns if the municipality does not have a website as required by this section shall not collect development fees until the report is filed and posted.

Q. Any action to collect a development fee shall be commenced within two years after the obligation to pay the fee accrues.

R. A municipality may continue to assess a development fee adopted before January 1, 2012 for any facility that was financed before June 1, 2011 if:

1. Development fees were pledged to repay debt service obligations related to the construction of the facility.

2. After August 1, 2014, any development fees collected under this subsection are used solely for the payment of principal and interest on the portion of the bonds, notes or other debt service obligations issued before June 1, 2011 to finance construction of the facility.

S. Through August 1, 2014, a development fee adopted before January 1, 2012 may be used to finance construction of a facility and may be pledged to repay debt service obligations if:

#### Section 9-463.06. Standards for enactment of moratorium; land development; limitations; definitions

A. A city or town shall not adopt a moratorium on construction or land development unless it first:

1. Provides notice to the public published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the community at least thirty days before a final public hearing to be held to consider the adoption of the moratorium.

2. Makes written findings justifying the need for the moratorium in the manner provided for in this section.

3. Holds a public hearing on the adoption of the moratorium and the findings that support the moratorium.

B. For urban or urbanizable land, a moratorium may be justified by demonstration of a need to prevent a shortage of essential public facilities that would otherwise occur during the effective period of the moratorium. This demonstration shall be based on reasonably available information and shall include at least the following findings:

1. A showing of the extent of need beyond the estimated capacity of existing essential public facilities expected to result from new land development, including identification of any essential public facilities currently operating beyond capacity and the portion of this capacity already committed to development, or in the case of water resources, a showing that, in an active management area, an assured water supply cannot be provided or, outside an active management area, a sufficient water supply cannot be provided, to the new land development, including identification of current water resources and the portion already committed to development.

2. That the moratorium is reasonably limited to those areas of the city or town where a shortage of essential public facilities would otherwise occur and on property that has not received development approvals based upon the sufficiency of existing essential public facilities.

3. That the housing and economic development needs of the area affected have been accommodated as much as possible in any program for allocating any remaining essential public facility capacity.

C. A moratorium not based on a shortage of essential public facilities under subsection B of this section may be justified only by a demonstration of compelling need for other public facilities, including police and fire facilities. This demonstration shall be based on reasonably available information and shall include at least the following findings:

1. For urban or urbanizable land:

(a) That application of existing development ordinances or regulations and other applicable law is inadequate to prevent irrevocable public harm from development in affected geographical areas.

(b) That the moratorium is sufficiently limited to ensure that a needed supply of affected housing types and the supply of commercial and industrial facilities within or in proximity to the city or town are not unreasonably restricted by the adoption of the moratorium.

(c) Stating the reasons that alternative methods of achieving the objectives of the moratorium are unsatisfactory.

(d) That the city or town has determined that the public harm that would be caused by failure to impose a moratorium outweighs the adverse effects on other affected local governments, including shifts in demand for housing or economic development, public facilities and services and buildable lands and the overall impact of the moratorium on population distribution.

(e) That the city or town proposing the moratorium has developed a work plan and time schedule for achieving the objectives of the moratorium.

2. For rural land:

(a) That application of existing development ordinances or regulations and other applicable law is inadequate to prevent irrevocable public harm from development in affected geographical areas.

(b) Stating the reasons that alternative methods of achieving the objectives of the moratorium are unsatisfactory.

(c) That the moratorium is sufficiently limited to ensure that lots or parcels outside the affected geographical areas are not unreasonably restricted by the adoption of the moratorium.

D. Any moratorium adopted pursuant to this section does not affect any express provision in a development agreement entered into pursuant to section 9-500.05 or as defined in section 11-1101 governing the rate, timing and sequencing of development, nor does it affect rights acquired pursuant to a protected development right granted according to chapter 11 of this title or title 11, chapter 9. Any moratorium adopted pursuant to this section shall provide a procedure pursuant to which an individual landowner may apply for a waiver of the moratorium's applicability to its property by claiming rights obtained pursuant to a development agreement, a protected development right or any vested right or by providing the public facilities that are the subject of the moratorium at the landowner's cost.

E. A moratorium adopted under subsection C, paragraph 1 of this section shall not remain in effect for more than one hundred twenty days, but such a moratorium may be extended for additional periods of time of up to one hundred twenty days if the city or town adopting the moratorium holds a public hearing on the proposed extension and adopts written findings that:

1. Verify the problem requiring the need for the moratorium to be extended.

2. Demonstrate that reasonable progress is being made to alleviate the problem resulting in the moratorium.

3. Set a specific duration for the renewal of the moratorium.

F. A city or town considering an extension of a moratorium shall provide notice to the general public published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the community at least thirty days before a final hearing is held to consider an extension of a moratorium.

A property owner may waive the forty-five-day waiting period for the owner's property that was part of the original unsuccessful annexation. Notice and a copy of the filing shall be given to the clerk of the board of supervisors and to the county assessor. The accurate map shall include all county rights-of-way and roadways that are within or contiguous to the exterior boundaries of the area of the proposed annexation. If state land, other than state land used as state rights-of-way or land held by the state by tax deed, is included in the territory, written approval of the state land commissioner and the selection board established by section 37-202 shall also be filed.

I. A city or town shall not annex territory if, as a result of that annexation, unincorporated territory is completely surrounded by the annexing city or town or a combination of the annexing city or town and other cities or towns.

J. Notwithstanding any provisions of this article to the contrary, any town incorporated before 1950 that had a population of less than two thousand persons by the 1970 census and that is bordered on at least three sides by Indian lands may annex by ordinance territory owned by the state within the same county for a new townsite that is not contiguous to the existing boundaries of the town.

K. Subsections H and I of this section do not apply to territory that at the time of the annexation was already completely surrounded by the same city or town or a combination of cities and towns.

Subsequent changes in zoning of the annexed territory shall be made according to existing procedures established by the city or town for the rezoning of land.

N. The annexation of territory within six miles of territory included in a pending incorporation petition filed with the county recorder pursuant to section 9-101.01, subsection D shall not cause an urbanized area to exist pursuant to section 9-101.01 that did not exist before the annexation.

O. As an alternative to the procedures established in this section, a county right-of-way or roadway may be transferred to an adjacent city or town by mutual consent of the governing bodies of the county and city or town if the property transferred is adjacent to the receiving city or town and if the city or town and county each approve the proposed transfer as a published agenda item at a regular public meeting of their governing bodies. A transfer of property made pursuant to this subsection shall be treated by the receiving city or town as if the transferred property was newly annexed territory.

P. On or before the date the governing body adopts the ordinance annexing territory, the governing body shall have approved a plan, policy or procedure to provide the annexed territory with appropriate levels of infrastructure and services to serve anticipated new development within ten years after the date the annexation becomes final pursuant to subsection D of this section.

For residential property of four or fewer units, a municipality shall not require payment of unpaid water and wastewater service rates and charges by anyone other than the person who the municipality has contracted with to provide the service, who physically resides or resided at the property and who receives or received the service.  A property owner, an immediate family member of the person who does not reside at the property or any other entity, at its sole discretion, may contract for water and wastewater service with a municipality and shall provide payment.

H. For residential property of four or fewer units, a municipality shall not refuse service within the municipality's service area for the unpaid water and wastewater rates and charges to anyone other than the person who physically resided and received the service at the property.

#### Section 9-511.02. Utility user fees; lien enforcement; procedures; payment responsibility; definition

A. A city or town may file a lien on property for the nonpayment of utility user fees for services provided to the property if the payment of the fees is delinquent for more than ninety days.

B. Before filing the lien, the city or town shall provide written notice to the owner of the property. The notice shall be given at least thirty days before filing the lien and shall include an opportunity for a hearing with a designated city or town official. The notice shall be either personally served or mailed to the property owner, at the last known address by certified mail, or to the address to which the tax bill for the property was last mailed. If the owner does not reside on the property, the notice shall be sent to the last known address.

C. The unpaid utility user fees, from the date of recording in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the property is located, are a lien on the property until the fees are paid. The lien is subject and inferior to the lien for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages and encumbrances of record. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under this section shall be made on judgment of foreclosure and order of sale. A city or town may bring an action to enforce the lien in the superior court in the county in which the property is located at any time after the recording, but failure to enforce the lien by this action does not affect its validity. The recorded unpaid utility user fees are prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited in the recording and of the regularity of all proceedings before the recording.

D. Unpaid utility user fees pursuant to this section accrue interest at the rate prescribed by section 44-1201.

E. A prior assessment of unpaid utility user fees for the purposes provided in this section does not bar a subsequent assessment for these purposes and any number of liens on the same lot or tract of land may be enforced in the same action.

F. Subsection A of this section does not apply to residential property occupied by a lessee where the lessee is responsible for payment of the utility user fees. The city or town shall determine the status of leased residential property prior to filing the lien.

G. For residential property of four or fewer units, a city or town may not require payment of unpaid utility user fees by anyone other than the person who has contracted with the city or town to provide the service, who physically resides or resided at the property and who receives or received the service. The property owner, an immediate family member of the person who does not reside at the property or any other entity, at their sole discretion, may establish service in their name for utility service with a city or town and shall be responsible for payment.

H. For purposes of this section "utility user fees" means fees charged for the provision of sewer.

3. For the portion of equipment or land used by a city or town to provide services outside its boundaries, make an in-lieu contribution to all state, city, town, county and other taxing districts equal to the taxes that would be required of private companies performing the same services, including any income tax obligation that would be incurred by a private company for services provided by the city or town outside of the city or town.

The city or town is located in a county with a population exceeding two million persons or the city or town has a population of less than two thousand five hundred persons and allows private enterprise to provide commercial and residential waste or garbage collection services, landfill services or recycling collection or processing services in the city or town.

D. For a city or town that has entered into a contract or mutual aid, reciprocal assistance or intergovernmental agreement with another entity before January 1, 2015 for landfill services or recycling collection or processing services outside of its boundaries, this section does not apply until the contract or mutual aid, reciprocal assistance or intergovernmental agreement expires or terminates or January 1, 2020, whichever is earlier.

#### Section 9-516. Declaration of public policy; eminent domain

A. It is declared as the public policy of the state that when adequate public utility service under authority of law is being rendered in an area, within or without the boundaries of a city or town, a competing service and installation shall not be authorized, instituted, made or carried on by a city or town unless or until that portion of the plant, system and business of the utility used and useful in rendering such service in the area in which the city or town seeks to serve, has been acquired.

B. The city or town which seeks to acquire the facilities of a public service corporation shall have the right to do so under eminent domain. Such action shall be brought and prosecuted in the same manner as other civil actions.

C. A city or town acquiring the facilities of a public service corporation rendering utility service without the boundaries of such city or town, or which renders utility service without its boundaries, shall not discontinue such service, once established, as long as such city or town owns or controls such utility.

#### Section 9-518. Compensation for taking public utility; procedure for determining

A. Whenever the fair valuation of the plant and property of a public utility has not for any reason been determined by any other method provided by law, or where no other method is provided, the city or town may, subject to the provisions of this section, by the exercise of the right of eminent domain institute an action pursuant to article 2, chapter 8, of title 12, and the court or jury shall, in the manner hereinafter provided, ascertain and assess the compensation to be paid for the taking of the plant and property of the public utility.

B. The court or jury shall ascertain the compensation to be paid for the taking of the plant and property of the public utility, which shall include the fair and equitable value of such plant and property, including its value as a going concern, and the actual and consequential damages, if any, sustained by the public utility by reason of the severance from the other plant and property of the public utility of the plant and property to be taken. Compensation and damages shall be fixed as of the date of the commencement of the trial at which such compensation and damages are finally determined.

C. Any party of the action may appeal to the supreme court in the same manner as is provided for appeals in other civil actions by filing a notice of appeal with the superior court within thirty days from the entry of the judgment or order appealed from and posting a bond for costs. Any such appeal to the supreme court shall be preferred and shall be heard and determined in preference to other civil matters, except election actions, habeas corpus, quo warranto, mandamus, injunction and other extraordinary writs to state officers and inferior courts of which the supreme court has original jurisdiction.

D. Within six months after the date when the judgment has become final following an appeal, or within six months after the expiration of the time allowed by this section for appeal if no appeal is taken, the city or town shall pay into court the amount fixed by the judgment for the use of the public utility and such other persons as the judgment may provide. The public utility and such other persons as the judgment may provide who are entitled to the money paid into court may demand and receive the money at any time after its deposit upon filing a satisfaction of the judgment or a receipt for the money. If the city or town fails or refuses to pay the amount of the judgment into court within such period of six months, the court shall vacate the judgment and enter judgment dismissing the complaint and taxing costs in favor of the defendants in the action, including in such event a reasonable allowance for engineering costs and expert witness fees.

E. Within thirty days after the date when the judgment becomes final following an appeal, or within thirty days after the expiration of the time allowed for appeal if no appeal is taken, the public utility shall file with the court a report, verified under oath, of the amounts actually expended by it for additions, betterments, improvements and extensions which it has been required to make between the date of the commencement of trial and the date of such report, together with an estimated forecast of the amounts it will be required to make for the public convenience and necessity during the ensuing six months. Thereafter, and until the expiration of the time provided for the payment by the city or town of the amount of the judgment into court, the public utility shall every thirty days file with the court a verified supplemental report of the amounts it has actually expended for such purposes since the date of the initial report. Such reports may be considered by the court in determining the amount of the deposit to be made or bond to be posted by the city or town as provided by subsection F, and may be considered at the trial provided by subsection I but shall not be conclusive of the amount to be ascertained as the compensation to be paid by the city or town for such additions, betterments, improvements and extensions.

F. Upon payment of the amount of the judgment into court within the time provided, the city or town shall make application to the court for an order permitting it to take possession of, and use and operate the plant and property of the public utility, including the additions, betterments, improvements and extensions for the public convenience and necessity which the public utility has been or will be required to make between the date of the commencement of the trial and the date of taking possession thereof by the city or town. Upon filing the application a time shall be fixed by the court for a hearing to determine the probable fair and equitable value of such additions, betterments, improvements and extensions, and written notice of such hearing shall be given to the public utility and other defendants, if any, at least ten days prior to the date fixed, by service of a copy of such notice in such manner as the court directs. On the day fixed for the hearing, the court shall determine the probable value of the additions, betterments, improvements and extensions which the public utility has been required to make since the date of the commencement of the trial, and shall direct that upon deposit of money, or the posting of a bond with good and sufficient sureties, in the amount so determined, the city or town shall be let into the possession and full use of the plant and property of the public utility described in the judgment, together with the additions, betterments, improvements and extensions made since the date of commencement of the trial. Upon deposit of the money or the posting of a bond in the required amount, the city or town may go into the possession and full use of the plant and property of the public utility, described in the judgment, together with the additions, betterments, improvements and extensions referred to in the order of the court. No appeal may be taken from an order of the court determining the amount of the deposit to be made or the bond to be posted by the city or town.

G. The parties may stipulate as to the amount of the deposit or of the bond in lieu of the deposit; but such stipulation or evidence of such deposit or of the bond shall not be introduced in evidence or used to the prejudice of any party to the action.

H. At the hearing to fix the probable value of the additions, betterments, improvements and extensions, the court shall direct the parties to file such supplemental pleadings as the court may deem necessary to set forth the claims of the public utility with respect to such value and the response of the city or town thereto, shall fix the time within which such pleadings should be filed, and shall set the matter for trial before the court or a jury for the purpose of ascertaining the compensation to be paid for the additions, betterments, improvements and extensions required to be made by the public utility between the date of commencement of the trial and the date the city or town is let into possession of the public utility's plant and property.

I. The court or jury shall ascertain the compensation to be paid for additions, betterments, improvements and extensions, which shall be the fair and equitable value thereof as of the date the city or town took possession of the public utility plant and property, and the amount so determined shall draw interest at the legal rate from such date. In fixing such value such additions, betterments, improvements and extensions shall not be considered or treated as being severed from the plant and property included in the judgment theretofore entered. Such additions, betterments, improvements or extensions shall be deemed to have been made for the public convenience and necessity, if such additions, betterments, improvements or extensions are found by the court to have been reasonably necessary and prudently made as incidental capital expense in the ordinary and usual conduct of a public utility business, or if the additions, betterments, improvements or extensions were ordered to be made by the corporation commission. Upon such value being determined a supplemental judgment shall be entered therefor, from which any party to the action may appeal to the supreme court in the same manner and within the same time as is provided for appeals from the judgment in the action, except that any asserted grounds for appeal shall be limited to those arising in the proceeding to fix the compensation to be paid for the betterments, additions, improvements and extensions.

J. Within ninety days after the date said supplemental judgment has become final following an appeal, or within ninety days after the expiration of the time allowed for appeal if no appeal is taken, the city or town shall pay into court all amounts fixed by the supplemental judgment for the use of the public utility and such other persons as the supplemental judgment shall provide, less any amount theretofore deposited with the court if such amount be less than the supplemental judgment. If the city or town shall have posted a bond, all amounts provided by the supplemental judgment shall be paid into court and the bond exonerated. The public utility and such other persons as the supplemental judgment may provide may demand and receive from the money deposited the amount of the supplemental judgment with interest and costs, if any.

K. If the complaint of the city or town is dismissed as provided by subsection D, no action in court to acquire or take the same plant and property of the public utility, or any portion thereof, shall be instituted by the city or town within three years after such dismissal.

L. All proceedings and trials provided by this section shall be preferred and shall be heard and determined in preference to other civil matters, except election actions.

M. The provisions of this section for ascertaining and assessing compensation for the taking of the plant and property of a public utility and the obtaining of possession and use of such property by a city or town are intended to be remedial.

#### Section 9-519. Common carriers; duplication of service prohibited

When territory within or without the corporate limits of a municipal corporation is being adequately served by a common carrier of passengers under authority of law, the municipal corporation shall not engage in business as a common carrier of passengers over the route or routes or within the territory being served by the common carrier.

#### Section 9-529. Form of bonds; payment and call; interest; sale; bids; interim receipts; rates and procedures; definition

A. Bonds issued under this article shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes of title 47.  They may be in one or more series, may bear dates, may be payable in a medium of payment, at places, may carry registration privileges, shall be executed in a manner, may contain other terms, covenants and conditions, and shall be in a form as the governing body may by resolution prescribe.  They shall be payable at one time, or from time to time, in a manner and in maturities not longer than thirty years from their date as the governing body may prescribe.  Any or all of the bonds may be callable at times, on terms and in a manner as the governing body by resolution may prescribe.

B. Any or all of the bonds may be sold by calling for bids at public sale, through an on-line bidding process, under an accelerated bidding process or by negotiated sale.  If sold under an accelerated bidding process, the bonds shall be sold at the lowest cost the governing body deems then available after having received at least three pricing quotations from recognized purchasers of bonds of the type being sold, and if sold at public sale or through an on-line bidding process to the person offering the best bid.

C. The bonds may be sold below, at or above par.  If the bonds are sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount plus interest to be paid on the bonds must not exceed the amount of interest that would be payable on the bonds over the maturity schedule prescribed by the governing body at the maximum rate set out in the resolution calling the election at which the bonds were voted.

D. If sold at public sale, the governing body shall call for bids by giving notice of the sale at least once a week for two successive weeks in cities having a population of fifteen thousand or more persons, and once a week for four successive weeks in all other cities and towns by publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. The notice shall be in the form the governing body prescribes.  If bonds are sold through an on-line bidding process, bids for the bonds that are entered into the system may be concealed until a specified time or disclosed in the on-line bidding process, may be subject to improvement in favor of the municipality before a specified time and may be for an entire issue of bonds or specified maturities according to the manner, terms and notice provisions ordered by the governing body.  These bids shall be for the entire bond issue unless the governing body by resolution allows bidding in parcels for less than the entire issue.

E. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, bonds may be sold to natural persons residing in this state by negotiated sale on terms the governing body deems to be the best then available and may bear interest payable at such times as determined by the governing body.  The bonds may be sold below, at or above par, but if an issue of bonds is sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount plus interest to be paid on the bonds must not exceed the amount of interest that would be payable on the bonds over the maturity schedule prescribed by the governing body at the maximum rate set out in the resolution calling the election at which the bonds were voted.

F. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, interim receipts or certificates may be issued to the purchasers of the bonds in a form and with provisions as the governing body may determine.

G. Bonds issued by municipalities may bear interest at any rate or rates not in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election, payable at the times determined by the governing body, provided that each bond may be evidenced by one instrument, or if commercial paper by a succession of instruments each bearing interest payable only at maturity. Bonds or commercial paper issued under this article shall be subject to the following:

1. The bonds may bear interest at a fixed, variable or combination rate, none of which exceeds the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election.

2. A variable rate shall be based on any objective measure of the current value of money borrowed such as the announced prime rate of a bank, the rates borne by obligations of the United States or an index or other formula provided for by the governing body. The governing body shall employ a recognized agent in municipal bonds to market and remarket the bonds or commercial paper issued and to establish an interest rate in accordance with the approved index or formula.

3. The governing body may grant to the owner of any bond a right to tender or may require the tender of the bond for payment or purchase at one or more times before maturity and may enter into appropriate agreements with any bank, other financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company for the purchase of bonds so tendered. The agreement may provide that while the bonds are held by the bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company the bonds may bear interest at a rate higher than when the bonds are held by other owners, but not in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election.

4. If bonds are tendered before maturity under an agreement to pay for or purchase bonds when tendered, the municipality may provide for the purchase and resale of the bonds pursuant to the tenders without extinguishing the obligation represented by them or incurring a new obligation on the resale, whether or not the bonds are represented by the same instruments when purchased as when resold.

5. Compensation for the resale of the bonds shall not be based on or measured by the difference between the price at which the bonds are purchased and the price at which they are resold.

6. The governing body may:

(a) Contract with a bank, other financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company to provide additional security for the bonds in the form of a line of credit, letter of credit, insurance policy or other security.

(b) Pay the costs of the additional security from amounts provided in the bond issue or from other available sources and may enter into reimbursement obligations in connection with the cost of the additional security.

7. Any reimbursement obligation entered into with the bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company shall not provide for the payment of interest in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election. The reimbursement obligation does not constitute a general obligation of the municipality and is payable from the same source as the bonds, or from other available revenues, as determined by the governing body. However, use of other available revenues does not create an indebtedness under article IX, section 8, Constitution of Arizona.

8. Variable rate bonds and commercial paper may be sold at competitive public sale, through an on-line bidding process or at negotiated sale. A competitive public sale may be accomplished pursuant to a notice of sale published at the times and in the manner provided in this section.  The notice shall provide terms and conditions as may be determined by the governing body.

B. The provisions of this article and any such resolution shall be deemed a contract with the holders of the bonds, and the duties of the municipality and its governing body and officers under this article and such resolution shall be enforceable by mandamus or other appropriate action in a court of competent jurisdiction.

#### Section 9-534. Certification of bonds by attorney general

A. A municipality may submit to the attorney general bonds to be issued under this article after all proceedings for their issuance have been taken, and thereupon it shall be the duty of the attorney general to examine the bonds and pass upon the validity thereof and the regularity of the proceedings authorizing their issuance.

If such proceedings conform to the provisions of this article, and the bonds when delivered and paid for will constitute binding and legal obligations of the municipality according to the terms thereof, the attorney general shall certify in substance upon the back of each bond that it is issued in accordance with the constitution and laws of this state.

#### Section 9-535. Prior lien of bonds

A. Except as otherwise provided in the resolution authorizing the bonds, all bonds of the same issue under this article shall have a prior and paramount lien on the revenue of the utility undertaking for which the bonds have been issued over and ahead of bonds of an issue payable from that revenue which may be subsequently authorized, and over and ahead of claims or other obligations of any nature against that revenue subsequently arising or subsequently incurred.

B. Bonds of the same issue issued under this article shall be equally and ratably secured, without priority by reason of number, date, sale, execution or delivery, by a lien on the revenue in accordance with the terms of the resolution authorizing the bonds.

#### Section 9-535.01. Refunding bonds and revenue-producing undertaking; refunding utility purchase contracts; form; sale and investment of proceeds; limitation on amount issued

A. Bonds may also be issued hereunder for the purpose of refunding any bonds issued under authority of this article or any bonds issued under the authority of title 35, chapter 3, article 3 or 4, for the acquisition, construction or improvement of any utility undertaking. If any city or town has outstanding unpaid balances on contracts heretofore entered into for the acquisition of water or other utility properties or facilities and such contracts are payable solely from the revenues thereof or of the utility undertaking extended or added to with the properties or facilities so acquired, whether or not title to such properties or facilities shall have vested in such city or town, all or any part of such unpaid balances may also be refunded hereunder and all such contracts so refunded are hereby validated and declared to be effective in accordance with their terms. No election on the issuance of such bonds shall be required, but if such bonds are combined into a single issue with bonds authorized for nonrefunding purposes hereunder, the bonds so authorized for nonrefunding purposes shall have been submitted at an election as otherwise provided in this article.

B. Refunding bonds issued hereunder shall have such details, shall bear such rate or rates of interest, and shall be otherwise issued, sold and secured as provided by the governing body of the city or town and as otherwise provided in this article, except that such changes in the security and revenues pledged to the payment of the obligations so refunded may be made by the governing body as may be provided by it in the proceedings authorizing such bonds, but in no event shall such bonds ever become a general obligation of the municipality issuing such refunding bonds unless such refunding bonds or the bonds to be refunded are tax secured bonds.

C. Refunding bonds issued hereunder may be exchanged for no less than a like principal amount of the bonds or unpaid contract obligations to be refunded, may be sold at a private or public sale or may be exchanged in part and sold in part. If sold, the net proceeds may be invested in obligations issued by the United States government, or one of its agencies, or obligations fully guaranteed by the United States government as to principal and interest so long as such investments will mature with interest so as to provide funds to pay when due, or called for redemption, the bonds or unpaid contract obligations to be refunded together with interest thereon and redemption premiums, if any, and such proceeds or obligations shall, and other funds legally available to the city or town for such purposes may be deposited in trust with a banking corporation or association doing business in Arizona that is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation, or any successor thereto, to be held for the payment and redemption of bonds or unpaid contract obligations to be refunded and such deposit and any reinvestment thereof shall be held in trust by the escrow agent for the payment of bonds or unpaid contract obligations with interest and redemption premiums, if any, on maturity or on an available redemption date or on an earlier voluntary surrender with the consent of the issuer. As to obligations so escrowed for the payment of contract balances payable in amounts or at times not fixed but dependent on earnings of the undertaking, it shall be sufficient if the obligations so purchased, if liquidated on the market at the par value thereof, will produce enough to pay such balances as the governing body estimates would have become payable under the terms of the contracts had such balances not been refunded, but the escrowed obligations must be not less in principal amount than the principal amount of the balances so refunded, and if at any time the income from the escrowed obligations is insufficient to pay all interest when payable on such refunded balances, such deficiencies shall be made up from the earnings of the undertaking on such priority basis as would have been applicable to such payment had such balances not been refunded. The term "net proceeds" as used above shall mean the gross proceeds of the refunding bonds after the deduction therefrom of all accrued interest and expenses incurred in connection with the authorization and issuance of the bonds and the refunding of the outstanding obligations, including all cost and expenses resulting from price variation to par or otherwise incurred in the purchase of obligations for escrow and in the distribution of the refunding bonds. The determination of the governing body issuing refunding bonds that the limitations herein imposed on the issuance of refunding bonds have been met shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud or arbitrary and gross abuse of discretion.

D. Bonds or unpaid contract obligations not maturing or callable for redemption under their terms may not be refunded hereunder without the consent of the holders unless the proceedings authorizing the issuance of the refunded bonds provide that they may be so refunded.

E. With respect to bonds issued to refund tax secured bonds, the provisions of title 35, chapter 3, article 4 shall govern in the event of any inconsistency between such article and this section.

 

#### Section 9-536. Payment of bonds

A. No holder of bonds issued under this article shall have the right to compel any exercise of the taxing power of the municipality to pay the bonds or the interest on such bonds. Each bond issued under this article shall recite in substance that payment of the bond and interest on such bond is enforceable exclusively from the revenue pledged to its payment.

B. Bonds issued under this article shall not be a debt of the municipality, nor shall payment of such bonds be enforceable out of any funds other than the revenue pledged to the payment of such bonds.

C. This section shall not apply to tax secured bonds issued pursuant to both this article and title 35, chapter 3, article 3.

#### Section 9-537. Supplemental nature of article

In so far as the provisions of this article are inconsistent with any other provision of law, the provisions hereof shall be controlling. The powers conferred by this article shall be in addition and supplemental to the powers conferred by any other law.

Bonds may be issued under this article for any utility undertaking, notwithstanding that any other law may provide for the issuance of bonds for a like purpose and without regard to the requirements, restrictions or provisions contained in any other law.

#### Section 9-538. Validation of prior bonds

Bonds lawfully issued under the provisions of chapter 4, session laws of 1940, first special session, and chapter 107, session laws of 1941, regular session, are validated and confirmed.

A political subdivision shall not levy a tax, rent, fee or charge on a telecommunications corporation, including a telecommunications corporation that provides interstate services as described in section 9-583, subsection C, for the use of a public highway to provide telecommunications services, or levy a tax, fee or charge on the privilege of engaging in the business of providing telecommunications services within that political subdivision other than:

1. Any transaction privilege tax authorized by law on the business of providing telecommunications services, except that this section does not allow the imposition of a transaction privilege tax on the business of providing interstate telecommunications services. Any transaction privilege tax authorized by law on the business of providing commercial mobile radio service shall not exceed the tax rate levied on the business of providing telecommunications services.

2. A telecommunications application fee for the issuance of a telecommunications license or franchise if the application fee applies on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis to all telecommunications corporations that use the public highways to provide telecommunications services.  A political subdivision may require only one application fee and one license or franchise for each telecommunications corporation whether the telecommunications corporation provides local services only or local and long-distance services, including intrastate or interstate services. An application fee is not required for a telecommunications corporation described in subsection E of this section.

3. A telecommunications construction permit fee for the issuance of a construction permit to place telecommunications facilities in the public highways if the permit fee applies on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis to all telecommunications corporations that place telecommunications facilities in the political subdivision's public highways to provide telecommunications services.  Political subdivisions shall establish a nonbinding outside arbitration procedure to attempt to resolve disputes over recovery of reasonable, proportionate and attributable costs of construction permit fees pursuant to this paragraph and other fees pursuant to this article before the disputes are submitted to a court for resolution.

4. A fee under section 9-583, subsection C.

B. All application fees, permit fees and charges levied by a political subdivision on telecommunications corporations pursuant to subsection A, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section shall be levied on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis and directly related to the costs incurred by the political subdivision in providing services relating to the granting or administration of applications or permits.  These fees and charges also shall be reasonably related in time to the occurrence of the costs.

C. Notwithstanding subsections A and B of this section, a political subdivision may require a telecommunications corporation to bear all of the reasonable costs associated with construction, maintenance and operation of its facilities in the public highway used to provide telecommunications services, including bearing reasonable costs associated with damage caused to public highways.

D. Notwithstanding subsections A and B of this section, in a license or franchise, a political subdivision and a telecommunications corporation may agree to in-kind payments for use of the public highways different from those specified in subsection A or B of this section.  The license or franchise shall be structured so that the in-kind payments made for use of the public highways to provide interstate telecommunications services under the license or franchise are less than or equal to and are offset against any linear foot charge owed pursuant to section 9-583, subsection C, paragraphs 2 and 3.  The license or franchise shall be structured so that the in-kind payments made under the license or franchise pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section are less than or equal to and are offset against any transaction privilege license tax on the business of providing telecommunications services.

Such telecommunications corporation shall require no additional grant from any political subdivision to provide telecommunications services.

F. This article does not affect the terms or conditions of any franchise, license or permit issued by a political subdivision before November 1, 1997, or to release any party from its obligations thereunder. Those franchises, licenses or permits shall remain fully enforceable in accordance with their terms. A political subdivision may lawfully enter into agreements with franchise holders, licensees or permittees to modify or terminate an existing franchise, license or agreement.

G. A political subdivision may not discriminate against a cable operator in its use of its cable system or prevent a cable operator from using its cable system in the public highways to provide telecommunications services and other noncable services if the cable operator complies with applicable federal and state requirements.  This subsection does not do either of the following:

1. Limit the authority of any political subdivision to license cable systems and to establish conditions on those licenses that are competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory with conditions applicable to telecommunications corporations and that are consistent with federal and state law.

2. Affect the authority of a political subdivision to manage the public highways within its boundaries or exercise its police powers and land use powers.

 

#### Section 9-583. Issuance of license or franchise; use of public highways; limitations

A. A political subdivision shall not adopt any ordinance that may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any telecommunications corporation to provide telecommunications service. Nothing in this section affects the authority of a political subdivision to manage the public highways within its jurisdiction or to exercise its police powers.

B. The governing board of a political subdivision may issue to a telecommunications corporation a license or franchise to use the public highways within the political subdivision to construct, install, operate and maintain telecommunications facilities. The political subdivision shall issue licenses or franchises on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis to persons subject to this section, within a reasonable period of time after application. As a condition of issuing a license or franchise to use the public highways to construct, install, operate and maintain telecommunications facilities, or a renewal thereof, a political subdivision may impose reasonable, competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory requirements on applicants which may include only:

1. Proof that the applicant has received a certificate of convenience and necessity from the Arizona corporation commission.

2. Public highway use requirements.

3. Mapping requirements.

4. Insurance, performance bonds, indemnification or similar requirements.

5. Enforcement and administrative provisions, consistent with this section.

C. A political subdivision may require a telecommunications corporation that will place underground facilities in the public highways, exclusive of facilities used by the local network and the portion of the interstate network that carries intrastate calls, for interstate telecommunications services to pay a fee as provided in this subsection and, subject to section 9-582, subsection A, paragraph 2, to obtain a license or franchise under this subsection to use the public highways to construct, install, operate and maintain facilities for these services. Subsections A, B, D and E of this section apply except:

1.  The requirement provided in subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section does not apply to a telecommunications corporation that provides solely interstate telecommunications services within this state.

2. A political subdivision may require a telecommunications corporation operating under this subsection to pay an annual fee based on the number of linear feet of trench in the public highways in which the telecommunications corporation has placed facilities that carry interstate traffic between and among the telecommunications corporation's interstate points of presence exclusive of facilities used by the local network and the portion of the interstate network that carries intrastate calls.

3. The rate per linear foot used in paragraph 2 of this subsection shall not exceed the highest rate per linear foot a political subdivision in this state charged any licensee or franchisee on or before December 31, 1999. The rate per linear foot shall not be increased in any calendar year by more than the increase in the average consumer price index as published by the United States department of labor, bureau of labor statistics.

D. A telecommunications licensee or franchisee may enter into contracts for use of the licensee's or franchisee's facilities within the public highways to provide telecommunications services. A political subdivision may require a telecommunications licensee or franchisee to disclose all persons with whom it contracts to use its facilities in the public highways within the political subdivision to provide telecommunications services. A political subdivision may require a person using a licensee's or franchisee's facilities in the public highways within the political subdivision to obtain from the political subdivision a telecommunications license or franchise if the person constructs, installs, operates or maintains telecommunications facilities within the public highways of the political subdivision.

E. The requirements imposed in a telecommunications license or franchise shall treat similarly situated telecommunications corporations similarly. The requirements may be changed over time and applied prospectively. Nothing in this subsection or subsection B of this section affects section 9-582, subsection D. A political subdivision may distinguish between a telecommunications corporation described in section 9-582, subsection E and other telecommunications corporations to a justifiable extent based on differences in legal rights.

F. Subsections B through E of this section do not apply to a telecommunications corporation described in section 9-582, subsection E.

G. The requirements of this section apply to applicants for licenses or franchises filed and acted on after December 1, 1998 or if earlier, the date after August 1, 1998 that a political subdivision adopts an ordinance implementing this article. Licenses or franchises issued pursuant to this section shall be for a term of five years and shall be renewed if:

1. The telecommunications corporation satisfies the conditions of the renewal license or franchise.

2. The renewal applicant has complied with the material terms of its prior license or franchise and applicable law. However, renewal shall not be denied for failure to comply with license or franchise terms unless the licensee or franchisee has had written notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure the defect in past performance.

(i) The eligible project had not been completed.

(ii) The eligible project has been completed.

(b) The construction of the eligible project and the total amount of state general fund revenues derived from the construction activity.

2. Compute the total cumulative amount of distributions pursuant to section 9-602 for the first through fifth years following the filing of the certificate of completion of construction for the eligible project pursuant to section 9-622 and from the first through each subsequent fifth year.

Compute the net cumulative distributions for the eligible project by subtracting the amount determined pursuant to paragraph 1, subdivision (b) of this subsection from either the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection or, if applicable, the amount of state monies paid under a lease purchase agreement pursuant to section 41-791.04.

4. Based on the analysis conducted pursuant to this subsection, estimate the minimum required attendance at the eligible project for the fifth year following the filing of the certificate of completion of construction of an eligible project pursuant to section 9-622 and each year thereafter.  The estimates shall be computed as follows:

(a) Divide the total state general fund revenues estimated pursuant to paragraph 1, subdivision (a), item (ii) of this subsection by the attendance estimated pursuant to paragraph 1, subdivision (a), item (ii) of this subsection.

(b) Divide the net cumulative distribution amounts for the fifth year following the filing of the certificate of completion of construction of an eligible project pursuant to section 9-622 and each year thereafter computed pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection by the quotient computed pursuant to subdivision (a) of this paragraph.

3. Notify the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and the governor of:

(a) The minimum required attendance amounts for those years computed pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 4, subdivision (c) of this section.

(b) The attendance estimate developed pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection.

1. The auditor general shall compute the difference between the estimated state general fund revenues and the net cumulative distributions by multiplying the net cumulative distributions computed pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 3 of this section by the difference between the ratio computed pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section and one.

2. The auditor general shall notify the state treasurer of:

(a) The ratio computed pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section.

(b) The difference computed pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection.

3. At the time of the next regularly scheduled distribution, the state treasurer shall withhold from the amount that would otherwise be distributed to the eligible city pursuant to section 42-5029 an amount equal to the amount stated in the notice received pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection.  If the amount available for distribution is less than the amount to be withheld, the state treasurer shall continue withholding from subsequent distributions until the full amount stated in the notice has been withheld.

(a) The auditor general shall not notify the state treasurer pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection, and the state treasurer shall not withhold pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection, pending completion of the analysis.

(b) The analysis shall be similar to the analysis described in subsection B of this section, except that the analysis shall examine the operations of the eligible project in the year for which the ratio is less than one.

(c) The analysis, at a minimum, shall estimate the total cumulative incremental revenues to the state general fund resulting from the completion of the eligible project including the revenues resulting from the construction activity associated with the completion of the eligible project.

(d) And the analysis demonstrates that the total cumulative incremental revenues to the state general fund exceed the total cumulative amount of distributions pursuant to section 9-602 as computed in subsection B, paragraph 3 of this section, the auditor general shall not notify the state treasurer pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection and the state treasurer shall not withhold pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection.

(e) And the analysis demonstrates that the total cumulative incremental revenues to the state general fund are less than the total cumulative amount of distributions pursuant to section 9-602 as computed in subsection B, paragraph 3 of this section:

(i) The auditor general shall subtract the amount of the total cumulative incremental revenues to the state general fund from the amount of the total cumulative distributions.

(ii) The auditor general shall notify the state treasurer of the difference computed pursuant to item (i) of this subdivision.

(iii) At the time of the next regularly scheduled distribution, the state treasurer shall withhold from the amount that would otherwise be distributed to the eligible city pursuant to section 42-5029 an amount equal to the amount stated in the notice received pursuant to item (ii) of this subdivision.  If the amount available for distribution is less than the amount to be withheld, the state treasurer shall continue withholding from subsequent distributions until the full amount stated in the notice has been withheld.

### Article 3 - Elections and Voters

#### Section 9-821. Law governing municipal elections

The manner of conducting and voting at elections of a city or town, of keeping the poll lists, counting and canvassing the votes, certifying the returns, declaring the results and notifying the persons elected, contesting the election, and all acts relating to the election, shall conform to the provisions of law relating to the general election of county officers as nearly as possible, except that the returns shall be made to the clerk of the city or town, and the governing body of the city or town shall canvass the returns, declare the result and issue the certificates of the election.

#### Section 9-821.01. Declaration of statewide concern; nonpartisan city and town elections; districts; procedure

A. Arizona courts have recognized that the Constitution of Arizona requires the legislature's involvement in issues relating to elections conducted by charter cities, including initiative and referendum elections, the method of elections other than by ballot, laws relating to primary elections, voter registration laws to prevent abuse and fraud and campaign finance laws. The legislature finds that the conduct of elections described in this section is a matter of statewide concern.

B. Notwithstanding any other law, a city or town shall not hold any election on candidates for which there is any indication on the ballot of the source of the candidacy or of the support of the candidate.

C. Notwithstanding any other law, for any city or town that provides for election of city or town council members by district, ward, precinct or other geographical designation, only those voters who are qualified electors of the district, ward, precinct or other geographic designation are eligible to vote for that council member candidate in the city or town's primary, general, runoff or other election.

D. Notwithstanding any other law or any charter provision, a city or town may by ordinance provide that at the primary election any candidate for the office of mayor or city council who receives a majority of all votes cast at that election for that office is declared elected to the office for which the person is a candidate, effective as of the date of the general election, and a further election may not be held as to such candidate. For the purposes of this subsection, the majority of votes cast is determined by:

1. Calculating the total number of actual votes cast for all candidates for an office whose names were lawfully on the ballot for that office.

2. Dividing the sum reached pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection by the number of seats to be filled for the office.

3. Dividing the number reached pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection by two and rounding that number to the highest whole number.

E. If more candidates receive a majority of votes cast than there are seats to be filled for the office pursuant to subsection D of this section, from among those candidates who receive a majority of votes cast, the candidates who receive the highest number of votes equal to the number of seats to be filled for the office is declared elected to that office.

F. If at the primary election no candidate receives the majority of the votes cast or the number of seats to be filled for the office is more than the number of candidates who receive a majority of votes cast, of the candidates who did not receive a majority of votes cast, the number of candidates who advance to the general or runoff election is equal in number to twice the number of seats to be filled for the office and the candidates who received the highest number of votes for the office are the only candidates at the general or runoff election. If more than one candidate received an equal number of votes and that number was the highest number of votes for the office, then all candidates receiving the equal number of votes are candidates at the general or runoff election.  The candidates equal in number to the seats to be filled for the office who receive the highest number of votes at the general or runoff election is declared elected to that office.  If two or more candidates receive an equal number of votes cast for the same office, and a higher number than any other candidate, the candidate who shall be declared elected is determined by lot in the presence of the candidates.  A write-in candidate may not advance to the general or runoff election if the write-in candidate did not receive a number of votes equivalent to at least the same number of signatures required by section 16-322 for nominating petitions for the same office.

G. In addition to subsection D of this section, any town with a population of five thousand persons or less may by majority vote of the qualified electors of the town voting on the question provide that at the primary election those candidates receiving the highest number of votes for the offices to be filled are declared elected to the office, and a further election may not be held if at least three-fifths of the seats are filled by persons receiving a majority of the votes cast as provided in subsection D of this section.

#### Section 9-822. Qualifications of voters

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, a person is not entitled to vote at an election in a city or town if the person has not been a qualified elector as defined in section 16-121 in the city or town for at least twenty-nine days preceding the election.

B. Any person who has resided for at least twenty-nine days preceding an election in an area annexed at least twenty-nine days before such election by a city or town is entitled to vote at any such city or town election, if the person is a qualified elector as defined in section 16-121 on the twenty-ninth day before the election.

 

#### Section 9-823. Registration of voters; change of registration

A. A city or town by ordinance or resolution in writing may provide for and require a registration of the voters of the city or town. The registration may be required every two years, and shall begin within sixty days before, and shall be closed ten days before, the regular city or town election.

B. The registration shall show:

1. The name in full of each registered voter.

2. The appropriate title of the voter and that the voter is eighteen years of age or over.

3. Place of birth.

4. Place of residence by street and number, or ward.

5. The date of entry of the registration on the register.

C. The voter may change the voter's place of residence as recorded on the register at any time before the closing of the register.

D. No person shall vote at any election in any district except the one in which the person has lived for at least ten days next preceding the election and as shown on the register.

E. Notwithstanding this section or sections 9-824, 16-104 and 16-105, no city or town may maintain a local voter registration list after July 1, 1985 if the county recorder of the county in which such city or town is located complies with section 16-172.

 

#### Section 9-824. Registration for elections

In elections where the question of issuing bonds of the municipal corporation is submitted to the qualified electors, the governing body by resolution may require a registration of all persons to vote at the elections, who possess such qualifications. The resolution shall be passed at least thirty days prior to holding the election, and the registration shall begin at least thirty days before and close ten days prior to holding the election.

 

#### Section 9-825. Election boards; appointment

At least ten days before an election held in a city or town not exceeding two thousand in population, according to the last official census thereof, the governing body shall appoint, from the qualified electors thereof, one inspector, two judges and two clerks, who shall constitute the election board. In a city or town exceeding two thousand in population, according to the last official census thereof, the governing body shall appoint one inspector, two judges and two clerks for each precinct within the corporate limits thereof who shall constitute the election board for such precinct.

#### Section 9-826. Publicity pamphlet format; state preemption; bond and tax measures

A. The legislature finds and determines that for the purposes of increasing voter knowledge and government transparency it is a matter of statewide concern that all municipalities fully inform voters of the effects of any vote to approve a bond, sales tax or property tax measure and, therefore, the legislature finds and declares that the publicity pamphlet format for these measures is of statewide concern.  This section preempts all local laws, ordinances and charter provisions to the contrary.

B. Notwithstanding any other law, for any municipal election to approve a bond, sales tax or property tax measure, the publicity pamphlet shall include the following:

1. For a bond approval, an estimate of the annual levy of property taxes sufficient to pay the debt on the bonds.

2. For a sales tax levy, the amount of the tax increase.

3. For a property tax levy, an estimate of the tax for:

(a) A single-family residence that is valued at one hundred thousand dollars.

A. For any new ordinance or code requiring a license, a municipality shall have in place an overall time frame during which the municipality will either grant or deny each type of license that it issues.  The overall time frame for each type of license shall state separately the administrative completeness review time frame and the substantive review time frame and shall be posted on the municipality's website or the website of an association of cities and towns if the municipality does not have a website.

B. On or before December 31, 2012, a municipality that issues licenses required under existing ordinances or codes shall have in place an overall time frame during which the municipality will either grant or deny each type of license that it issues.  The overall time frame for each type of license shall state separately the administrative completeness review time frame and the substantive review time frame and shall be posted on the municipality's website or the website of an association of cities and towns if the municipality does not have a website. Municipalities shall prioritize the establishment of time frames for those licenses that have the greatest impact on the public.

C. In establishing time frames, municipalities shall consider all of the following:

E. If a municipality determines that an application for a license is not administratively complete, the municipality shall include a comprehensive list of the specific deficiencies in the written or electronic notice provided pursuant to subsection D of this section. If the municipality issues a written or electronic notice of deficiencies within the administrative completeness time frame, the administrative completeness review time frame and the overall time frame are suspended from the date the notice is issued until the date that the municipality receives the missing information from the applicant. The municipality may issue an additional written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies based on the applicant's submission of missing information. If the permit sought requires approval of more than one department of the municipality, each department may issue an additional written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies based on the applicant's submission of missing information.

F. If a municipality does not issue a written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies within the administrative completeness review time frame, the application is deemed administratively complete. If a municipality issues a timely written or electronic notice of deficiencies, an application shall not be complete until all requested information has been received by the municipality. A municipality may consider an application withdrawn if, by fifteen days or more after the date of notice, as established by the municipality, the applicant does not supply the documentation or information requested or an explanation of why the information cannot be provided within the established time period.

G. During the substantive review time frame, a municipality may make one comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections.  If the municipality identifies legal requirements that were not included in the comprehensive request for corrections, the municipality may amend the comprehensive request for corrections once to include the legal requirements and the legal authority for the requirements. If the permit sought requires approval of more than one department of the municipality, each department may issue a comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections. If the applicant fails to resolve an issue identified in a request for corrections, the municipality may make supplemental written or electronic requests for corrections that are limited to issues previously identified in a comprehensive request for corrections. If a municipality issues a comprehensive written or electronic request or a supplemental request for corrections, the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame are suspended from the date the request is issued until the date that the municipality receives the corrections from the applicant. If an applicant requests significant changes, alterations, additions or amendments to an application that are consistent with the purposes of the original application and that are not in response to the request for corrections, a municipality may make one additional comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections and may have no more than an additional fifty per cent of the substantive review time frame as established by the municipality for that license to grant or deny the license. Nothing shall prevent communication between a municipality and an applicant regarding a comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections or a supplemental request for corrections. A municipality may consider an application withdrawn if, by thirty days or more after the date of notice, as established by the municipality, the applicant does not supply the documentation or information requested or an explanation of why the information cannot be provided within the established time period.

H. Nothing shall prevent the municipality from continuing to process the application during the suspension of the substantive review time frame and overall time frame.

I. By mutual written or electronic agreement, a municipality and an applicant for a license may extend the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame. An extension of the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame may not exceed fifty per cent of the overall time frame.

J. Unless a municipality and an applicant for a license mutually agree to extend the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame pursuant to subsection I of this section, a municipality shall issue a written or electronic notice granting or denying a license to an applicant. If a municipality denies or withdraws an application for a license, the municipality shall include in the written or electronic notice at least the following information:

1. Justification for the denial or withdrawal with references to the statutes, ordinances, codes or substantive policy statements on which the denial or withdrawal is based.

2. An explanation of the applicant's right to appeal the denial or withdrawal. The explanation shall include the number of working days in which the applicant must file a protest challenging the denial or withdrawal and the name and telephone number of a municipal contact person who can answer questions regarding the appeals process.

3. An explanation of the applicant's right to resubmit the application, the total amount of fees that will be assessed if the applicant resubmits the application and the method in which those fees were calculated.

K. If a municipality does not issue the applicant the written or electronic notice granting or denying a license within the overall time frame or within the mutually agreed on time frame extension, the municipality shall refund to the applicant all fees charged for reviewing and acting on the application for the license and shall excuse payment of any fees that have not yet been paid. The municipality shall not require an applicant to submit an application for a refund pursuant to this subsection. The refund shall be made within thirty working days after the expiration of the overall time frame or the time frame extension. The municipality shall continue to process the application.  Notwithstanding any other statute, the municipality shall make the refund from the fund in which the application fees were originally deposited. The right to receive a refund of fees charged for reviewing and acting on the application for the license may not be waived by an applicant.

L. If an application for a license is denied and the applicant resubmits the application for the same purposes with only revisions or corrections to the original application, the municipality shall not assess any additional application fees that exceed the cost of processing the resubmitted revisions or corrections. This subsection does not apply to license applications that were denied for disqualifying criminal convictions or that were submitted fraudulently.

M. If an application for a license is withdrawn and the applicant resubmits the application for the same purpose, the municipality shall not assess any additional application fees that exceed fifty per cent of the original applicant fees that have not been refunded to the applicant.  This subsection does not apply to license applications that were denied for disqualifying criminal convictions or that were submitted fraudulently.

"Protected development right" means the right to undertake and complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of a protected development right plan and this article, without compliance with subsequent changes in zoning regulations and development standards, except as provided by section 9-1204.

4. "Protected development right plan" means a plan submitted by a landowner to a city or town, that, if approved by the legislative body of the city or town and if identified as a protected development right plan at the time it is submitted, grants the landowner, for a specified period of time, a protected development right to undertake and complete the development as shown on the plan. The protected development right plan shall be submitted to a city or town for site development approval.  A protected development right plan for a phased development shall be in the form of a plan for a master planned development which may include a planned unit development, planned community development or district, planned residential development or district or planned area development or district if such land use category or district is recognized and provided for in the zoning ordinance of the city or town.  A protected development right plan for a nonphased development must provide the final site development approval needed for issuance of a building permit.

#### Section 9-1202. Protected development right; establishment; plan requirements; variance

A. A city or town may provide by ordinance or resolution the requirements for a development to be a phased development.  If a city or town does not adopt an ordinance or resolution that includes the requirements for a development to be a phased development, a plan submitted as a protected development right plan may be identified as a plan for a phased development at the time the plan is submitted.

B. A protected development right plan, at a minimum, shall describe with a reasonable degree of certainty all of the following:

1. The proposed uses of the site.

2. The boundaries of the site.

3. Significant topographical and other natural features affecting development of the site.

4. For other than a phased development, the general location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures and other improvements.

5. The number of dwelling units and, for other than a phased development, the square footage and height of the proposed buildings and other structures.

6. The location of all existing and proposed utilities and a provision for other infrastructure on the site, including water, sewers, roads and pedestrian walkways.

C. Nothing in this section is intended to or shall preclude a city or town from establishing additional requirements for submittal or approval of development plans for any land use category or district and such requirements may include traffic reports or studies, drainage reports or studies, master street plans, development phasing schedules and phased public infrastructure schedules.  A city or town shall require submission of a more detailed plan for each phase of a phased development in order to obtain final site development approval to develop the property.

D. A final subdivision plat that meets the requirements of subsection B, and section 9-463.01 shall be a protected development right plan.

E. A protected development right is established only for the specific elements of the development or other specific matters shown on the approved protected development right plan. A protected development right is not established for any elements or other matters, or portions of any elements of the development or other matters not shown on the approved protected development right plan.

F. The legislative body of a city or town may designate by ordinance or resolution a development plan that is not identified as a protected development right plan at the time it is submitted as a protected development right plan upon a finding by such legislative body that granting a protected development right to undertake and complete the development shown on the plan will promote reasonable certainty, stability and fairness in the land use planning and regulatory process and secure the reasonable investment backed expectations of the landowner.

G. A protected development right shall be deemed established with respect to a property on the effective date of a valid approval of a protected development right plan. The protected development right confers on the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the property under the terms and conditions of the protected development right plan and this article.

H. A city or town shall not require a landowner to waive a protected development right as a condition of development approval.

I. A protected development right is subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the city or town on the protected development right plan approval and nothing in this section is intended to or shall preclude a city or town from establishing such terms and conditions.

J. A protected development right plan approved with a condition or stipulation that a variance be obtained does not confer a protected development right until the necessary variance is obtained. Approval of a protected development right plan does not guarantee approval of a variance.

 

 

#### Section 9-1203. Duration of a protected development right; termination

A. A protected development right established under a protected development right plan is valid for three years for a nonphased development or five years for a phased development.

B. A city or town may extend for a maximum of two additional years the duration of a protected development right obtained through approval of a protected development right plan, if a longer time period is warranted by all relevant circumstances, including the size, type and phasing of the development on the property, the level of investment of the landowner, economic cycles and market conditions. The decision to extend the time period for a protected development right is in the discretion of the city or town. However, a protected development right shall not remain established for more than five years for a nonphased development or seven years for a phased development.

C. After the approval of a protected development right plan, the plan may be subject to subsequent reviews and approvals by the city or town to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval if these reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval. The city or town may revoke its approval of the protected development right plan for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions imposed on the approval.

D. A protected development right terminates at the end of the applicable period established under this section. If a building permit has been issued before the date of termination of a protected development right, the protected development right remains valid until the building permit expires, but in no event for longer than one year. On expiration, only principal structures for which footings or foundations have been completed may be finished under the protected development right. On the expiration of a protected development right, development may continue based on a valid building permit and according to standards in effect at that time. An unexpired building permit issued for a property with a protected development right neither expires nor shall be revoked merely because a protected development right expires under the time limitations specified in this section.

#### Section 9-1204. Subsequent changes prohibited; exceptions

A. A protected development right established under this section precludes the enforcement against the property to which the protected development right applies of any legislative or administrative land use regulation by a city or town or pursuant to an initiated measure that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, delay or otherwise impact the development or use of the property as set forth in an approved protected development right plan, except under any one or more of the following circumstances:

1. With the written consent of the affected landowner.

2. On findings, by ordinance or resolution, and after notice and a public hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare if the project were to proceed as approved in the protected development right plan.

3. On findings, by ordinance or resolution, and after notice and a hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations that made a difference in the approval of the protected development right plan by the city or town.

4. On the enactment of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes development as approved in the protected development right plan, in which case the governing body of the city or town, after notice and a hearing, may modify the affected provisions, on a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the protected development right plan.

B. A protected development right does not preclude the enforcement of a subsequently adopted overlay zoning classification that imposes additional requirements and that does not affect the allowable type or density of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and that are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the city or town, such as building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the establishment of a protected development right does not preclude, change or impair the authority of a city or town to adopt and enforce zoning ordinance provisions governing nonconforming property or uses.

D. This article does not alter or diminish the authority of a city or town to exercise its eminent domain powers.

#### Section 9-1205. Protected development right; exercise; agreements

A. A protected development right obtained under this chapter is not a personal right but attaches to and runs with the applicable property. After approval of a protected development right plan, all successors to the original landowner are entitled to exercise the protected development rights.

B. Nothing in this article precludes judicial determination, based on common law principles or statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable taking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter the existing common law of vested rights.

C. Nothing in this article shall preclude, change or limit the ability of a city or town to enter into a development agreement under section 9-500.05.

A. Except the license fee on gross revenue authorized by section 9-1443 and transaction privilege taxes as provided in subsection B of this section, a local government may not levy a tax, rent, fee or charge, however denominated, on a video service provider for the use of the highways to provide video service or levy a tax, fee or charge on the privilege of engaging in the business of providing video service in the service area.

D. A local government may not require a video service provider to provide in-kind goods or services, make in-kind payments, assessments or obligations or pay a fee in addition to the monetary license fee levied or assessed as provided in section 9-1443, except for any of the following:

1. A local law may impose and enforce obligations equally and uniformly on all video service providers that are operating within the boundaries of a local government and on all holdover cable operators that hold a local license that remains in effect under section 9-1414, subsection A. Under the local law, a local government:

(a) May require all video service providers to provide channel capacity for the video service provider to transmit programming over which the video service provider exercises no editorial control except as authorized by 47 United States Code section 531(e).  The channel capacity shall be limited to one of the following:

(i) Not more than two channels of public, educational or governmental access programming in the basic service tier of the video service network and not more than two channels of noncommercial governmental programming, at least one of which may be programmed by the federal government, in the digital programming tier of the video service network.

(ii) Not more than two lines of access programming with each line of programming carried on up to two standard definition channels and two switched digital high-definition channels.

(c) May require all video service providers to incur costs and expenses to provide, maintain and operate facilities and equipment of the video service network, including facilities and equipment for signal carriage, processing, reformatting and interconnection for all of the following:

(i) To connect the video service network or cable system, as it may be relocated from time to time, to transmit programming to and from existing locations of public, educational or governmental access facilities and to allow monitoring of access programming at the facilities.

(ii) To transmit public, educational and governmental access channels to subscribers with the same prevailing quality, functionality and identification as other channels.

(d) May require all video service providers and incumbent cable operators to provide at no initial or recurring charge the basic service tier of video service to one outlet and one receiving device at each building occupied by the local government if the building is not more than two hundred feet from the nearest technically and commercially feasible point of connection on the video service network.

2. A local government may retain nonreceiving equipment that it owns without charge for the equipment's use and at the local government's expense, including equipment previously provided by an incumbent cable operator.

E. A local law may not impose any obligation on a video service provider under subsection D of this section that is more burdensome than the least burdensome requirement under any local license with a service area within the boundaries of the local government that was in effect on February 1, 2019.

F. None of the annual fair market value of any channel capacity provided pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 1, subdivision (a), the annual costs and expenses incurred pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 1, subdivision (c) and the annual fair market value of basic service and line extension provided pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 1, subdivision (d) may be offset against the license fee levied or assessed under this section.

G. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, by a nondiscriminatory local law that imposes and enforces the obligations equally and uniformly on all video service providers operating within the boundaries of a local government, a local government may require that a video service provider bear all of the reasonable costs that are associated with repair and restoration of damage caused to private property or highways by the repair, replacement, installation, construction, maintenance or operation of the video service provider's facilities in the highways and that are imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis in relation to costs borne by telecommunications corporations under section 9-582, subsection C.

H. On application, a local government shall issue to a video service provider or its affiliate a permit to attach allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment to the video service network in the highways within the boundaries of the local government. The permit shall allow installation, operation and maintenance of allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment. A local government may require that all of the allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment at a single location fit within a fifteen-inch cube and be contained entirely within a ground-mounted pedestal or be connected directly to and mounted at the same height as one of the video service provider's aerial horizontal conductors.  This subsection does not do any of the following:

1. Prohibit a local government from requiring a video service provider to place underground aerial facilities to which allowed Wi-Fi equipment is attached.

2. Prohibit the imposition of a tax, rent, fee or charge on revenue from services provided through allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment.

3. Affect the authority of a local government to manage the highways within its boundaries or to exercise its police powers, including review and approval of an application before issuing a permit.

4. Affect any authority of a political subdivision, including an agricultural improvement district or any other special taxing district, the local government or any other person controlling utility poles in the highways to deny, limit, restrict or determine the terms and conditions for the use of or attachment to the utility poles or attachments to other poles of the political subdivision, local government or other person by a video service provider.

I. This section does not prohibit a video service provider from agreeing with a local government to provide in-kind services or goods or make in-kind payments in the service area that are otherwise prohibited by this section if the agreement with the local government is not entered into as a condition of operating in the service area under a uniform video service license issued pursuant to this chapter. The agreement may authorize the video service provider to retain license fees and taxes collected from its subscribers in the amount of any offset to license fees specified in the agreement.

J. For the purposes of this section, "allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment" means radio equipment that uses only unlicensed radio spectrum and that enables wireless communication with a communications network for unlicensed services such as Wi-Fi service.

#### Section 9-1443. License fee; requirements, conditions and limitations; pass through to subscribers

A. For the privilege of a video service provider to occupy or use, in whole or in part, any highway within the boundaries of a local government to provide video service through a video service network, the local government may require a video service provider to pay a license fee to the local government based on the gross revenue that the video service provider receives from its subscribers located within the boundaries of the local government.  The license fee both:

1. Is subject to the limit prescribed in section 9-1442, subsection B and to offset, including amounts collected from subscribers, as prescribed by section 9-1442, subsections A and I and subsection D of this section.

2. Shall be due no more often than quarterly.

B. If the local government requires a license fee pursuant to subsection A of this section, the local government shall adopt a local law that imposes the license fee equally and uniformly on all of the following that are operating within the boundaries of the local government:

1. Video service providers.

2. Designate the amount of the license fee collected from each subscriber as a separate line item on the subscriber's bill.

#### Section 9-1444. Ownership of a video service network

A local government may not acquire an ownership interest in a video service network unless the ownership interest is acquired at not less than fair market value.

#### Section 9-1445. Review and audit; bundling discounts; action to recover underpayment or overpayment

A. Not more than once every three years, a local government, on reasonable written notice, may audit the business books and records of a video service provider to the extent necessary to ensure payment of license fees pursuant to this chapter.  A local government may assess additional license fees due at any time within four years after the date on which the fees were required to be paid.  Any audit of a period of time before issuance of a uniform video service license shall be conducted pursuant to the local laws in effect during the period of time.

B. Except as otherwise provided by federal law, if a video service provider offers video service bundled with other services that are not video service for a single discounted price, all of the following apply:

1. The method that the video service provider uses to determine gross revenue subject to license fees by allocating the single discounted price among the bundle of video service and nonvideo services shall be reasonable and supported by the video service provider's books and records.

2. The local government shall accept as reasonable, for purposes of meeting the video service provider's burden of proof, an allocation based on an objective and verifiable method using the books and records that the video service provider kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including nontax purposes.

3. A video service provider may not use bundled offerings as a means to evade paying license fees.

C. The local government and the video service provider shall each pay its own costs and fees relating to each audit performed pursuant to subsection A of this section. If the sum determined to be underpaid exceeds five percent of the total fees that the audit determines should have been paid for the period, the video service provider shall pay the local government's reasonable costs of the audit.

D. The rate of interest for both underpayments and overpayments is the federal short-term rate determined pursuant to 26 United States Code section 6621(b), plus three percentage points.

E. A person that performs a review and audit under subsection A of this section may not receive compensation that is based, in whole or in part, on either of the following:

1. Finding a particular result.

2. The amount of any underpayment or overpayment of the license fee that is identified because of the review and audit.

F. A complaint by a local government for underpayment of a license fee from a video service provider or by a video service provider for overpayment of a license fee to a local government shall be made pursuant to article 5 of this chapter.

G. A complaint for a violation of the license fee obligations under this chapter may not be made unless a written demand by a local government for payment of the license fees or a written demand by a video service provider for refund of license fees is made within four months after the local government or video service provider realizes it has been damaged or knows or reasonably should know of the damage caused by the alleged violation.

H. A complaint must be filed pursuant to article 5 of this chapter within three years after the written demand is made pursuant to subsection G of this section but not sooner than six months after the written demand.
