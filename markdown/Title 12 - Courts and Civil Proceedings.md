A. The administrative office of the courts, in consultation with each county's adult probation department, shall calculate a county probation success incentive payment for each county for the most recently completed fiscal year.  Each county's probation success incentive payment equals the number of probationers successfully prevented from entering prison, compared to the county-specific historical baselines calculated in subsection G, paragraph 1 of this section multiplied by fifty percent of the marginal cost of incarceration as required by subsection F of this section. The administrative office of the courts shall calculate a statewide probation success incentive grant payment that equals the number of probationers successfully prevented from entering prison statewide, compared to the statewide historical baseline calculated in subsection G, paragraph 1 of this section multiplied by twenty-five percent of the marginal cost of incarceration as required by subsection F of this section. Subject to legislative appropriation, the administrative office of the courts shall proportionately allocate the county probation success incentive payments to each county based on the specific calculations made pursuant to subsection G of this section. Subject to legislative appropriation, the administrative office of the courts shall deposit the statewide probation success incentive grant payment in a subaccount established by the administrative office of the courts for the purpose of recidivism reduction and improving probation services.

B. Each county shall use its probation success incentive payment and any monies received from a statewide probation success incentive grant to improve supervision and rehabilitative services for probationers, including any of the following:

1. Implementing and expanding evidence-based practices for risk and needs assessments for individualized programming.

2. Implementing and expanding intermediate sanctions, including mandatory community restitution, home detention, day reporting, restorative justice programs and work furlough programs.

3. Expanding the availability of evidence-based practices for rehabilitation programs, including drug and alcohol treatment, mental health treatment, anger management, cognitive behavior programs and job training and employment services.

4. Recognizing and rewarding probation officers in adult probation departments whose work has advanced the implementation of evidence-based practices or who have contributed to the probation department's recidivism reduction efforts.

5. Paying for continuing education and training that focuses on evidence-based practices for probation officers or probation staff, or both.

6. Evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation and supervision programs and ensuring program fidelity.

C. The administrative office of the courts shall allocate county probation success incentive payments to each county for distribution to the county's adult probation department to implement the programs prescribed in subsection B of this section. A board that includes the chief probation officer from each county shall determine the distribution of statewide probation success incentive grant monies. A county's chief probation officer must be recused in a vote that may award a grant to the chief probation officer's probation department. The county and statewide probation success incentive payments allocated pursuant to this section shall be used to supplement, not supplant, any other state or county appropriation for the adult probation department.

D. For any county or statewide probation success incentive payments allocated or grants awarded to a county, the county shall distribute the allocated monies to its adult probation department, which must use the monies for improving probation services and recidivism reduction funding activities prescribed in subsection B of this section. In the county's discretion, the county may retain up to fifteen percent of the allocated monies for administrative and data collection purposes.

E. In any fiscal year in which a county receives incentive payments or grants, the monies shall be made available to the county's adult probation department to implement probation programming within sixty days after the allocation of those monies. The county adult probation department shall maintain a complete and accurate accounting of all monies received pursuant to this section.

F. At the end of each fiscal year, the director of the state department of corrections shall calculate the marginal cost of incarceration for that fiscal year and provide that information to the administrative office of the courts. The calculation shall take into consideration factors such as the average length of stay in prison and variable corrections costs, including health care services, food and clothing.

G. At the end of each fiscal year, the administrative office of the courts shall gather data on, calculate and report the following for each fiscal year:

1. The probation failure rate for this state and each county. To make this calculation, the baseline probation failure rate equals the average number of adult probationers who failed to successfully complete a term of probation during fiscal years 2007-2008, 2014-2015 and 2018-2019, as a percentage of the average number of probationers who successfully completed a term of probation during that same time period. When calculating probation failure, if a person on probation spends fewer than fourteen days in detention, that person's detention is not a probation failure. For the purposes of calculating the probation failure rate and the baseline probation failure rate, the number of adult probationers who failed to successfully complete a term of probation includes the following:

(a) A probationer whose probation was revoked for a new crime or technical violation.

(b) A probationer whose whereabouts are unknown and for whom an arrest warrant was issued during the fiscal year.

(c) A probationer whose probation is terminated on serving a sentence in a county jail in lieu of probation revocation for a new crime or technical violation.

2. An estimate of the number of adult probationers this state and each county successfully prevented from failing probation.  This estimate is calculated based on the reduction in the probation failure rate as calculated annually pursuant to the baseline probation failure rate calculated pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection. In making this estimate, the administrative office of the courts, in consultation with the adult probation department, shall adjust the calculations to account for changes in the adult probation caseload in the most recent completed fiscal year as compared to the adult probation population during fiscal years 2007-2008, 2014-2015 and 2018-2019.

3. The current total population of probationers for the last three years per county as of the date of the required report.

H. If data of sufficient quality and of the types required by this section are not available, the administrative office of the courts shall use the best available data to estimate probation success rates using a methodology that is as consistent with that described in this section as is reasonably possible.

I. The administrative office of the courts shall include an estimate of the total monies to be held and administered in the following fiscal year as part of the judiciary's proposed budget.

J. Each county board of supervisors shall periodically provide oversight regarding the allocation of incentive payment grants to the specific departments that are tasked with administering the probation programming to ensure that disbursed monies are appropriately used as specified in subsection B of this section.

K. Each adult probation department shall define and track specific outcome-based measures, including all of the following:

1. The percentage of probationers who are supervised in accordance with evidence-based practices.

2. The specific supervision policies, procedures, programs and practices that were eliminated.

3. The percentage of probationers who successfully complete the period of supervision.

4. The number of probation absconders who are located each year and the disposition of these cases.

5. The amount of monies received by each adult probation department.

L. On or before December 31, 2022 and annually thereafter, each adult probation department that receives incentive payments or grants pursuant to this section shall submit a written report to the administrative office of the courts and the county board of supervisors that accounts for incentive payments received and grants awarded and that evaluates the effectiveness of the program.

M. On or before July 1, 2023 and annually thereafter, the administrative office of the courts shall submit to the governor, the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate and the joint legislative budget committee a comprehensive report on the implementation of this section. The report must include all of the following information:

1. The effectiveness of programs based on the reports of performance-based outcome measures required in subsection K of this section.

B. Failure to collect the fee shall not affect the validity of the act or service.

C. The court may allow fees to be paid by alternative methods, including credit cards, charge cards, debit cards and electronic funds transfers.

D. No court shall either impose or collect a fee for filing an answer to a complaint for forcible entry or detainer.

#### Section 12-302. Extension of time for payment of fees and costs; relief from default for nonpayment; deferral or waiver of court fees and costs; definitions

A. The court or any judge may for good cause shown extend the time for paying any court fees and costs required by law or may relieve against a default caused by nonpayment of a fee within the time provided by law, but no fees paid shall be refunded.

B. The supreme court shall adopt forms and procedures for deferral or waiver of court fees and costs.

C. Except as provided in subsection E of this section, the court shall grant an application for deferral of court fees and costs if the applicant establishes by affidavit, including supporting documentation, that the applicant either:

1. Is receiving benefits pursuant to one or more of the following programs:

(a) The temporary assistance for needy families program established by section 403 of title 4 of the social security act as it exists after August 21, 1996.

(b) The food stamp program (7 United States Code sections 2011 through 2029).

2. Is receiving benefits pursuant to the supplemental security income program (42 United States Code sections 1381 through 1385).

3. Has an income that is insufficient or barely sufficient to meet the daily essentials of life and that includes no allotment that could be budgeted for the fees and costs that are required to gain access to the court.  In considering insufficient income pursuant to this paragraph, the court may consider the following as evidence of insufficient income:

(a) The applicant has a gross income that as computed on a monthly basis is one hundred fifty percent or less of the current poverty level established by the United States department of health and human services.  Gross monthly income includes the applicant's share of community property income.

(b) The applicant's income is considered to be sufficient, but the applicant provides proof of extraordinary expenses, including medical expenses, costs of care for elderly family members or family members with disabilities or other expenses that are deemed extraordinary, that reduce the applicant's gross monthly income to at or below one hundred fifty percent of the current poverty level established by the United States department of health and human services.

D. On proof that the applicant is permanently unable to pay fees or costs, the court shall waive them.  For the purposes of this subsection, "permanently unable to pay" means the applicant's income and liquid assets are insufficient or barely sufficient to meet the daily essentials of life and the income and liquid assets are unlikely to change in the foreseeable future.

E. Except in cases of dissolution of marriage, legal separation, annulment or establishment, enforcement or modification of child support, and notwithstanding subsection A of this section or chapter 9, article 4 of this title, if the applicant is an inmate who is confined to a correctional facility operated by the state department of corrections and who initiates a civil action or proceeding, the inmate is responsible for the full payment of actual court fees and costs. On filing the civil action or proceeding, the clerk of the court shall assess and, when monies exist, collect as a partial payment of any court fees and costs required by law a first time payment of twenty percent. Thereafter the state department of corrections shall withhold twenty percent of all deposits into the prisoner's spendable account administered by the department until the actual court fees and costs are collected in full. The state department of corrections shall annually forward any monies withheld to the clerk of the court of each court of jurisdiction before January 31. If a prisoner is released before the full fees and costs are collected, the state department of corrections shall forward the amount of fees and costs collected through the date of the prisoner's release. The clerk of the court of each court of jurisdiction is responsible for sending the state department of corrections a copy of the order mandating the amount of fees and costs to be paid. This subsection does not prohibit an applicant from filing a civil action or proceeding if the applicant is unable to pay the filing fees.

F. At the time an applicant signs and submits the application for deferral to the court, the applicant shall acknowledge under oath and sign a consent to judgment. By signing the consent to judgment, the applicant consents to judgment being entered against the applicant for all fees and costs that are deferred but that remain unpaid after thirty calendar days following the entry of final judgment or order. A consent judgment may be entered against the applicant unless one of the following applies:

1. The applicant has an established schedule of payment in effect and is current with payments.

2. A supplemental application for further deferral or waiver has been filed and is pending.

3. In response to a supplemental application, the court orders that the fees and costs be further deferred or waived.

4. Within twenty days of the date the court denies the supplemental application, the applicant either pays the fees or requests a hearing on the court's final order denying further deferral or waiver.  If the applicant requests a hearing, the court shall not enter a consent judgment unless a hearing is held, further deferral or waiver is denied and payment has not been made within the time prescribed by the court.

G. An applicant who is granted a deferral or waiver or a party to the action who knows of any change in the financial circumstances of the applicant shall promptly notify the court of the change in the applicant's financial circumstances during the pendency of the action that affects the applicant's ability to pay court fees and costs. If within ten days after notice and a hearing the court determines that the applicant's financial circumstances have changed and that the applicant no longer meets the eligibility requirements of this section, the court shall order the applicant to pay the deferred or waived fees and costs.

H. The following court fees and costs may be deferred or waived, except that the county shall pay the fees and costs in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this subsection on the granting of an application for deferral or waiver and an applicant who has been granted a deferral shall reimburse the county for the fees and costs in paragraphs 6 and 7 of this subsection:

1. Filing fees.

2. Fees for issuance of either a summons or subpoena.

3. Fees for obtaining one certified copy of a temporary order in a domestic relations case.

4. Fees for obtaining one certified copy of a final order, judgment or decree in all civil proceedings.

(a) The applicant established by affidavit that the applicant has attempted without success to obtain voluntary acceptance of service of process.

(b) The applicant's attempt to obtain voluntary acceptance of service of process would be futile or dangerous.

(c) An order of protection or an injunction against harassment in favor of the applicant and against the party sought to be served exists and is enforceable.

6. The fee for service by publication if service is required by law and if the applicant establishes by affidavit specific facts to show that the applicant has exercised due diligence in attempting to locate the person to be served and has been unable to do so.

7. Court reporter's fees for the preparation of court transcripts if the court reporter is employed by the court.

8. Appeal preparation and filing fees at all levels of appeal and photocopy fees for the preparation of the record on appeal pursuant to sections 12-119.01, 12-120.31 and 12-2107 and section 12-284, subsection A.

I. If the case is appealed, the initial deferral or waiver remains in effect unless there is a change in the applicant's financial circumstances. If a case is appealed an applicant may be required to submit to the appellate court a new application for a deferral or waiver of the court fees and costs.

J. If a judgment is rendered for court fees and costs, the court fees and costs deferred but unpaid and the expenses paid by the county under this section shall be included in the judgment and shall be paid directly to the clerk of the court by the party against whom the court fees and costs were assessed.

K. A waiver of court fees or costs shall not be granted for:

1. Matters that are filed as class actions pursuant to rule 23 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure.

2. Civil actions other than cases of dissolution of marriage, legal separation, annulment or establishment, enforcement or modification of child support that are filed by persons who at the time of filing the application are incarcerated as a result of a felony conviction in an out-of-state correctional facility or in a jail waiting to be transported to a state department of corrections facility.

3. Civil actions other than cases of dissolution of marriage, legal separation, annulment or establishment, enforcement or modification of child support filed by a pro se litigant who has been previously declared a vexatious litigant by any court.

L. This section does not limit the court's discretion in deferring, waiving or ordering the county to pay any fees and costs as may be necessary and appropriate.

M. If an applicant who is granted a deferral or waiver is found to be a vexatious litigant by any court during the pendency of the action, the court shall order the applicant to pay the deferred or waived fees and costs.

N. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Deferral" means either postponement of an obligation to pay fees or establishment of a schedule for payment of fees.

2. "Further deferral" means the establishment of a schedule for payment of fees.

C. This section does not preclude an existing cause of action for the failure of an employer to provide adequate supervision of an employee or independent contractor, except that the fact that the employee or independent contractor has previously been convicted of a criminal offense may be introduced into evidence if the employer knew of the conviction or was grossly negligent in not knowing of the conviction and the conviction was directly related to the nature of the employee's or independent contractor's work and the conduct that gave rise to the alleged injury that is the basis of the cause of action.

B. If the transferor assumed or incurred successor asbestos-related liabilities in connection with a prior merger or consolidation with a prior transferor, the fair market value of the total assets of the prior transferor determined as of the time of the earlier merger or consolidation shall be substituted for the limitation under subsection A of this section to determine the limitation of liability of a successor corporation.

2. In the absence of other readily available information from which the fair market value can be determined, by reference to the value of the assets recorded on a balance sheet.

#### Section 12-559.03. Adjustment of the fair market value of total gross assets

A. Except as provided in subsections B, C and D of this section, the fair market value of total gross assets at the time of the merger or consolidation shall increase annually at a rate equal to the sum of the following:

B. The election shall be made pursuant to court rule. Any objection to the election shall be made pursuant to court rule.

D. If an effective election is on file at the commencement of trial, all claims, including third party claims, counterclaims and claims consolidated for trial shall be tried under this article unless the court finds that a separate trial or other proceeding should be held on some or all of the claims that are not the subject of the election.

E. An effective election may be withdrawn only by consent of all parties to the claim to which the election relates.

#### Section 12-583. Good cause hearing

A. In a hearing held to determine whether good cause exists not to try a claim under this article, the court shall consider the circumstances of the parties and all relevant factors, including, but not limited to:

1. Whether the risk that a lump sum award would be dissipated is insignificant.

2. Whether the amount of future damages is too small or the time over which the payments would be made is too short or the economic savings are not such as to warrant payment in periodic installments.

#### Section 12-584. Special findings; future damages

A. If liability is found in a trial conducted under this article, the trier of fact shall make separate findings for each claimant specifying the amount of any:

1. Past damages in a lump sum.

2. Future damages for noneconomic loss in a lump sum.

3. Future damages and the periods over which they will accrue, on an annual basis, for each of the following types:

(a) Costs of health care.

(b) Other economic loss.

B. The findings for future costs of health care of an injured claimant shall reflect the costs and losses during each year the trier of fact finds the claimant will sustain those costs and losses. The findings for other future economic loss of an injured claimant shall be based on the losses that the claimant or beneficiary will sustain over the period of time the claimant or the deceased would have lived but for the bodily injury on which the claim is based.

C. The trier of fact may find that future costs of health care will continue for the duration of the claimant's life, in which case it is not necessary to decide how long the claimant will live. If the trier of fact so finds, the trier of fact shall determine the costs of health care the claimant will incur each year while living.

#### Section 12-585. Evidence of future damages

A. The calculation for all future economic damages shall reflect future changes in earning power or the purchasing power of the dollar. Future damages shall not be discounted to present value, except pursuant to section 12-589.

B. Unless the court otherwise directs or the parties otherwise agree, the annual amounts for future damages shall be prorated and paid at one month intervals during the year due. Each payment is payable on the first day of the month following its accrual.

#### Section 12-586. Entering a judgment for future damages

A. If special findings for future damages are made, the court shall enter judgment pursuant to the following procedures:

1. The court shall apply to the findings of past and future damages any applicable rules of law in calculating the respective amounts of past and future damages each claimant is entitled to recover and each party is obligated to pay.

2. The court shall specify payment of attorney fees and litigation expenses separately from the periodic installments payable to the claimant pursuant to any agreement entered into between the claimant and his attorney. Under a percentage attorney fee contract, unless the contract specifies otherwise, the portion of the fee applicable to the recovery of the periodic installments of future damages is computed by multiplying the fee percentage times the cost of an annuity which would satisfy the funding requirements under sections 12-587 and 12-588.

B. A reduction in installments of future damages made pursuant to this section for payment of attorney's fees shall reduce proportionally all periodic installments for future damages.

C. The court shall enter judgment in lump sum for past damages and for any future damages payable in lump sum or otherwise under this section. The court shall also enter judgment for the payment in periodic installments of the remaining amounts of future damages, without reduction to present value. The periodic installments shall be set forth in the judgment in a schedule that shows the annual amount due in each year the trier of fact has found that losses will accrue. If a finding has been made that costs of health care will continue for the duration of the claimant's life, the judgment shall set forth the finding and the amount of those annual losses.

#### Section 12-587. Funding judgments for periodic installments

A. Each party liable for all or a portion of a judgment containing periodic installments shall provide funding, separately or jointly, for the unpaid installments in a form prescribed in section 12-588. The funding shall be provided not later than the date the judgment is subject to execution or not later than thirty days after the judgment is entered, whichever is later, unless it is superseded or the power to execute on the judgment is otherwise suspended.

B. A liability insurer having a contractual obligation or a person adjudged to have an obligation to pay all or part of a judgment entered for periodic installments is obligated to provide funding to the extent of the contractual or adjudged obligation. In determining if a judgment containing periodic installments for future damages exceeds limits under a liability insurance policy, the installments for future damages in the judgment shall be discounted to present value under section 12-589 to compute the lump sum value. The lump sum value or the cost of an annuity which would satisfy the funding requirement for installments of future damages, whichever is less, must be added to the total of any lump sum damages contained in the judgment for each claimant. The amount so computed shall be compared to applicable limits under the policy.

C. A judgment creditor or successor in interest and any party having rights under subsection E of this section may at any time subsequent to the judgment request the court to find that funding was not provided or maintained with regard to a judgment obligation owing to the requesting party. If the court finds that such funding as required by the judgment was not provided, the court shall order that funding be provided within the time ordered by the court. If such funding as required by the judgment is not provided within the time specified by the court, the court shall compute the lump sum equivalent of the obligation under section 12-589 and enter a judgment for that amount in favor of the requesting party.

D. If a person who is the only person liable for a portion of a judgment for periodic installments fails to provide or maintain funding, the right to a lump sum judgment under subsection C of this section applies only against that person and the portion of the judgment owed.

E. If more than one person is liable for all or a portion of periodic installments ordered by the judgment, and the required funding is provided by one or more but fewer than all of the persons liable, those providing funding may bring an action to satisfy or protect rights of reimbursement from a person not providing funding. If a person who has provided funding seeks to enforce rights for funding against a nonfunding person, the court may order the nonfunding person to indemnify those providing funding for a proportionate share of the cost of the funding provided or of the cost of an annuity as provided in section 12-588 which would satisfy the funding requirement.

F. If funding approved by the court has been provided, the judgment debtor on whose behalf the funding is provided is discharged and any lien against the judgment debtor is released. A liability insurer providing funding that meets the requirements of section 12-588 on behalf of a judgment debtor, to the extent it is obligated to do so under any applicable liability insurance contract, is deemed to have satisfied its duty to pay damages.

G. The court in which a trial is conducted under this article shall retain jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this section if a judgment for periodic installments is entered.

#### Section 12-588. Form of funding

A. Funding authorized or required for payment of a judgment for periodic installments shall be approved by the court as sufficient to guarantee financial solvency and be in one or more of the following forms:

1. An annuity contract issued by one or more qualified insurers.

2. An agreement by one or more qualified insurers to fund the judgment.

3. Any other form of funding which the court approves and to which the claimant consents.

B. Funding under this section qualifies as a required supersedeas bond.

C. In the event of a qualified assignment under section 130 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, the qualified assignee and any qualified insurer shall be jointly and severally liable but the qualified insurer's obligation shall be the primary obligation.

#### Section 12-589. Discounting future damages to present value

A. If future damages are ordered to be paid in advance of the period to which they apply, the court shall compute the present value of the future payments by discounting each remaining annual payment by a rate of interest equal to the interest rate of the most recent issue of fifty-two week United States treasury bills sold before the date damages are discounted.

B. To compute the present value of a lifetime award of future damages pursuant to section 12-584, subsection C, the duration of the term of payments shall be the life expectancy of the claimant at the time the computation is made prescribed by the race neutral life expectancy table for the appropriate sex in the current population survey collected by the bureau of the census for the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor.

#### Section 12-590. Effect of death on periodic installments

A. The liability for payment of periodic installments for costs of health care not yet due at the death of the person entitled to receive the benefits terminates on the death of the person. Liability for payment of any other installments or portions of installments not yet due at the death of the person entitled to receive them terminates, except as provided in subsections B and C.

B. If, in an action for wrongful death, a judgment for periodic installments provides payments to more than one person and one or more but fewer than all of them die, the surviving beneficiaries are entitled to shares proportionate to their shares in the periodic installments not yet paid to the deceased beneficiary or beneficiaries. The surviving beneficiaries are not entitled to receive payments beyond the periods specified for such beneficiaries in the judgment.

C. If, in an action other than for wrongful death, a judgment for periodic installments is entered and a person entitled to receive benefits for economic losses other than for costs of health care under the judgment dies, any periodic installments not yet due at the person's death shall be paid to a beneficiary designated in writing by the deceased or, in the absence of such a designation, to the estate of the deceased.

#### Section 12-591. Assignment of periodic installments

An assignment of or an agreement to assign any right to periodic installments for future damages is not enforceable except for:

1. The payment of alimony, maintenance, spousal support or child support.

2. The costs of products, services or accommodations provided or to be provided by the assignee for health care.

3. Attorney fees and other litigation expenses incurred in obtaining or enforcing the judgment.

#### Section 12-592. Exemption of benefits

Periodic installments for future damages for loss of earnings or loss of support for beneficiaries of a judgment entered in a wrongful death action are exempt from garnishment, attachment, execution and any other process or claim to the extent wages or earnings are exempt under any applicable law. Periodic installments for all other future damages are exempt under garnishment, attachment, execution and any other process or claim except to the extent they may be assigned pursuant to section 12-591.

#### Section 12-593. Duties of the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions and insurance companies

1. For determining which insurers and assignees are financially qualified to provide and maintain the funding required under this article and to be designated as qualified insurers.

2. To require insurers to provide and maintain funding under section 12-587 if required by court order.

3. For publishing and revising a list of persons who have been designated by the director as qualified insurers.

B. The director shall annually review and evaluate the effectiveness of the system of periodic payments. If pursuant to such review and evaluation, the director determines that the system of periodic payments is effectively reducing the cost of medical malpractice tort claims for bodily injury, the director shall order appropriate actuarially justified rate adjustments based on those findings.

C. In order to qualify under this section, an insurance company shall:

1. Have at least an "A+" (superior) rating and a financial size category of VIII in the current edition of Best insurance reports as published by A. M. Best company.

#### Section 12-594. Arbitration and settlement agreements

A. This article also applies to claims for bodily injury arising out of medical malpractice that are subject to arbitration either by law or if the parties have agreed to its application by contract.

B. Parties to an action on any claim for bodily injury arising out of medical malpractice may file with the clerk of the court in which the action is pending, or, if none is pending, with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction over the claim, a settlement agreement for future damages payable in periodic installments. The settlement agreement may provide that one or more sections of this article apply to it.

#### Section 12-1116. Actions for condemnation; immediate possession; money deposit

A. All actions for condemnation shall be brought as other civil actions in the superior court in the county in which the property is located except that, at least twenty days before filing an action for condemnation of property or any interest in property, the plaintiff shall deliver to the property owner of record and as a courtesy to the sole lessee of record, if applicable, according to the records of the county recorder in the county in which the property is located:

1. A written offer to purchase the property or interest in the property and to pay just compensation for the property or interest in the property and for any compensable damages to any remaining property.  The offer must constitute the plaintiff's estimate of just compensation.  The offer may be made subject to any lessees of record or any lessees who may claim a compensable interest.  The offer does not impose an obligation on the plaintiff to provide a written offer to purchase the lessee's interest.

2. One or more appraisals that support the amount of the proposed compensation.

B. Except for special taxing districts formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 17, if no lease is recorded or if more than one lease is recorded for the property with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located, at least twenty days before filing an action for condemnation of property or any interest in property, the plaintiff shall provide notice of the offer and appraisal to the party having a plain and obvious commercial ownership or operational interest in substantial improvements on the property by posting the notice in plain sight at the property that may be subject to condemnation.

C. For special taxing districts formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 17, if more than one lease is recorded for the property with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located, at least twenty days before filing an action for condemnation of property or any interest in property, the plaintiff shall provide notice of the offer and appraisal by delivering to all property interest holders of record the notice that an offer has been made and an appraisal has been conducted.  The notice does not apply to lessees of record if the lease or other written agreement governing the interest holder's rights in the property provides that the property interest holder would not be entitled to condemnation proceeds.

D. If a lessee that is not noted in the record of the county recorder and has a commercial ownership or operational interest in substantial improvements on the property requests a copy of the offer and appraisal the plaintiff shall promptly comply with the request on presentation of documentation by the lessee of the lessee's interest in the property.

E. At the time of filing the complaint, or at any time after filing the complaint, the plaintiff may apply to the court for an order permitting the plaintiff to take possession of and use the property sought to be condemned for the purpose prayed for.

F. The superior court may waive the requirements of subsection A, B, C or D of this section if the court determines that the plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable harm that outweighs the property owner's or lessee's interest.

G. On filing the application, the court shall set a time for a hearing.  Notice shall be served on the parties in interest by personal service within the state, or by publication if without the state, in any manner as the court directs.

H. On the day of the hearing, if it appears that the use for which the property is sought to be condemned is a necessary use, the court shall receive evidence as to the probable damages to each owner, possessor or person having an interest in each parcel of land sought to be condemned and of any unpaid property taxes that have been levied, including penalties and interest, on the property sought to be condemned and may direct that on a deposit of money, on direct payment to each owner, possessor or person having an interest in each parcel, or if the condemnor is the state or a county, city, town or political subdivision of this state, on posting a bond in a form to be approved by the court, the plaintiff shall be let into the possession and full use of the parcels of land, as described in the order, for the purposes specified in the order.

I. The plaintiff may deposit the money or bond with the clerk of the court or the state treasurer.  The money or bond may be held for the use and benefit of each person having an interest in each parcel of land sought to be condemned, subject to final judgment after trial of the action, and may be held also as a fund to pay any further damages and costs recovered in the proceedings and any unpaid property taxes that were levied as of the date of the order for immediate possession, including penalties and interest, on the property sought to be condemned, as well as all damages sustained by the defendant if for any cause the property is not finally taken for public use. The deposit of the money or bond shall not discharge the plaintiff from liability to maintain the fund in full, but it shall remain deposited for all accidents, defalcations or other contingencies, as between the parties to the proceedings, at the risk of the plaintiff, until the compensation or damage is finally settled by judicial determination, and the court awards such part of the money or bond as shall be determined to the defendant, or until the clerk or the state treasurer is ordered by the court to disburse it.  The clerk of the court or the state treasurer is liable to the plaintiff for the deposit or bond if it is lost or abstracted.

J. If the plaintiff elects to deposit the money or bond in the state treasury, the state treasurer shall receive the money or bond and return a receipt for the money or bond to the court, and the state treasurer shall safely keep the deposit in a special fund to be entered on the state treasurer's books as the condemnation fund.  The state treasurer shall invest and divest monies in the condemnation fund as provided by section 35-313, and monies earned from investment shall be credited to the fund.  The state treasurer shall disburse the money deposited and, if necessary, convert the investments to cash for the purpose of making the disbursements or forfeit the bond as the court may direct pursuant to its judgment.  After satisfaction of the judgment in a condemnation action and payment of any unpaid property taxes that were levied as of the date of the order for immediate possession, including penalties and interest, on the property sought to be condemned, the excess, if any, of the deposit made regarding the action, including monies earned by the investment and reinvestment of the deposit, shall be returned by the state treasurer to the plaintiff by a warrant that the department of administration shall issue upon direction of the state treasurer after having received a certified copy of the judgment and without regard to provisions requiring the filing of a claim against the state.  Any monies remaining in the condemnation fund at the end of the fiscal year do not revert to the state general fund.

K. If the plaintiff elects to deposit the money or bond with the clerk of the court, the clerk shall receive the money or bond and return a receipt for the money or bond to the court, and the clerk is liable to the plaintiff if the money or bond is lost or abstracted.  The clerk shall disburse the money or forfeit the bond as the court may direct pursuant to its judgment. Any money remaining in a deposit after the judgment of the court and all unpaid property taxes that were levied as of the date of the order for immediate possession, including penalties and interest, have been fully paid shall be returned by the clerk to the plaintiff.

L. On application by any party, the court may order that money deposited with the clerk of the court or the state treasurer be paid to any owner, possessor or person having an interest in any parcel.

M. Subject to court approval, the parties may also stipulate any of the following with any owner, occupant or possessor of any parcel:

1. To the amount of money that the plaintiff may deposit with the clerk of the court or with the state treasurer for any owner, occupant or possessor of any parcel.

2. To the amount of direct payment to any owner, occupant or possessor of any parcel.

3. To the payment of money deposited with the clerk of the court or the state treasurer to any owner, occupant or possessor of any parcel.

4. For the release of any bond on payment to any owner, occupant or possessor of any parcel.

N. A person in interest for whom a deposit has been made pursuant to stipulation for the person's withdrawal is entitled to interest on the amount that the person is allowed to withdraw from the date the order for immediate possession is signed by the court pursuant to subsection C of this section until the date of withdrawal.  This person is also entitled to interest on that portion of the final judgment, exclusive of costs allowed by the court, that exceeds the amount that is deposited for the person's withdrawal from the date the order for immediate possession is signed by the court until the judgment is paid.  If the amount that is withdrawn by any defendant exceeds the amount of the final judgment awarded the defendant inclusive of costs allowed by the court and any unpaid property taxes that were levied as of the date of the order for immediate possession, including penalties and interest, on the property sought to be condemned, the defendant withdrawing the funds immediately shall repay to the plaintiff the excess, with legal interest from the date of withdrawal to the date of repayment, except that the amount that is necessary to pay any unpaid property taxes that were levied as of the date of the order for immediate possession, including penalties and interest, on the property shall be paid to the county treasurer of the county in which the property sought to be condemned is located.

O. Any stipulation that is made or any evidence that is introduced pursuant to this section shall not be introduced in evidence or used to the prejudice of any party in interest on the trial of the action.

1. The value of the property sought to be condemned and all improvements on the property pertaining to the realty, and of each and every separate estate or interest in the property, and if it consists of different parcels, the value of each parcel and each estate or interest in the parcel separately.

2. If the property sought to be condemned constitutes only a part of a larger parcel, the damages that will accrue to the portion not sought to be condemned by reason of its severance from the portion sought to be condemned, and the construction of the improvement in the manner proposed by the plaintiff.

3. How much the portion not sought to be condemned and each estate or interest in the portion will be benefited separately, if at all, by construction of the improvement proposed by the plaintiff. If the benefit is equal to the damages assessed under paragraph 2 of this subsection, the owner of the parcel shall be allowed no compensation except for the value of the portion taken, but if the benefit is less than the damages so assessed, the benefit shall be deducted from the damages, and the remainder shall be the only damages allowed in addition to the value.

4. If the property sought to be condemned is for a railroad, the cost of good and sufficient fences along the line of the railroad, and the cost of cattle guards where fences may cross the line of the railroad.

B. If there is an order for immediate possession before the final judgment, the compensation and damages awarded shall draw interest from the date the order is entered by the court. If the defendant is allowed to withdraw money deposited by the plaintiff pursuant to section 12-1116, subsection M, the defendant is entitled to interest on the money that the defendant is allowed to withdraw from the date the order for immediate possession is signed by the court until the date of the withdrawal.

B. The court having jurisdiction of a condemnation action under this article shall award the owner with any right to, title to or interest in the property that is the subject of the action an amount that will reimburse the owner for the owner's reasonable costs, disbursements and expenses, including reasonable attorney, appraisal and engineering fees, actually incurred because of the condemnation proceeding if either of the following occurs:

1. The final judgment is that the plaintiff cannot acquire the real property by condemnation.

2. The proceeding is abandoned on a motion by the plaintiff.

#### Section 12-1130. Fees and expenses; appraisal; relocation benefits; applicability

D. In a condemnation action to acquire owner-occupied residential property, the court may award fees and other expenses to any party other than this state or a city, town or county or any other political subdivision of this state.  In making the determination, the court may consider the amount of the difference between the final offer and the compensation awarded, the percentage of the difference between the final offer and the award and any other factors the court deems appropriate. For the purposes of this subsection, "fees and other expenses" means the reasonable expenses of expert witnesses, the reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test or project that the court finds to be directly related to and necessary for the presentation of the party's case and reasonable and necessary attorney fees.

#### Section 12-1307. Verdicts in actions to recover specific personal property

In an action for the recovery of specific personal property, if the property has not been delivered to the plaintiff, or if the defendant by his answer claims a return thereof, the jury, if its verdict is in favor of the plaintiff, or if its verdict is in favor of the defendant and it also finds that defendant is entitled to have the property returned to him, it shall determine the value of the property and may at the same time assess the damages, if any are claimed in the complaint or answer, which the prevailing party has sustained by reason of the taking or detention of such property.

#### Section 12-1308. Finding for defendant; judgment; election to take value or property

A. If the defendant alleges that he is the owner of the property, is entitled to its possession and demands its return, and if on the trial it is found that he is its owner and that he was at the time the action was brought entitled to its possession, then on the trial the value of the property replevied shall be found, together with any damage the defendant has suffered for the wrongful seizure of the property, and judgment shall be against the plaintiff claimant and the sureties on the replevin bond for the value of the property, the damages and costs of the action and reasonable attorney's fees. The judgment shall also be for the return of the property to the adverse party at a time and place specified.

B. The defendant shall elect whether he will take the property itself or the amount found as the value of the property. The election shall be made in order to permit the plaintiff a reasonable time before the time specified in the judgment for delivery of the property.

#### Section 12-1311. Failure to deliver property; election by prevailing party

If the party adjudged to return the property fails so to do at the time and place adjudged, unless by the election he is allowed to retain it, then the party in default shall be adjudged in contempt of the court and shall continue in contempt until he delivers the property as adjudged if the property is in his possession or under his control.

#### Section 12-1362. Dwelling action; notice of intent to repair or replace; jurisdictional prerequisite; insurance; bifurcated trial; legislative intent

A. Except with respect to claims for alleged construction defects involving an immediate threat to the life or safety of persons occupying or visiting the dwelling, a purchaser must first comply with this article before filing a dwelling action.

B. A seller and the seller's construction professional who receive a written notice of claim pursuant to section 12-1363 have a right pursuant to section 12-1363 to repair or replace any alleged construction defects after sending or delivering to the purchaser a written notice of intent to repair or replace the alleged construction defects.  The seller and the seller's construction professional do not need to repair or replace all of the alleged construction defects.  A purchaser may not file a dwelling action until the seller and the seller's construction professional have completed all intended repairs and replacements of the alleged construction defects.

C. If a seller or a seller's construction professional presents a notice received pursuant to section 12-1363 to an insurer that has issued an insurance policy to the seller or the seller's construction professional that covers the seller's or the seller's construction professional's liability arising out of a construction defect or the design, construction or sale of the property that is the subject of the notice, the insurer must treat the notice as a notice of a claim subject to the terms and conditions of the policy of insurance.  An insurer must work cooperatively and in good faith with the insured seller or the seller's construction professional within the time frames specified in this article to effectuate the purpose of this article.  This subsection does not affect the coverage available under the policy of insurance or create a cause of action against an insurer whose actions were reasonable under the circumstances, notwithstanding its inability to comply with the time frames specified in section 12-1363.

D. Subject to Arizona rules of court, the identified construction professionals shall be joined as third-party defendants, if feasible.  Subject to Arizona rules of court, for each construction defect found to exist, the trier of fact in any dwelling action filed pursuant to this article shall first determine if a construction defect exists and the amount of damages caused by the defect and identify each seller or construction professional whose conduct, whether by action or omission, may have caused, in whole or in part, any construction defect. The purchaser has the burden of proof to demonstrate the existence of a construction defect and the amount of the damages caused by the construction defect. The trier of fact shall thereafter determine the relative degree of fault of any defendant or third-party defendant. The trier of fact shall allocate the pro rata share of liability based on relative degree of fault. The seller has the burden to prove the pro rata share of liability of any third-party defendant.  The determination of whether a construction defect exists, the amount of damages caused by the construction defect and who may have caused, in whole or in part, the construction defect shall be bifurcated from and take place in a separate phase of the trial or alternative dispute resolution process from the determination of the relative degree of fault of any defendant or third-party defendant, unless the court finds that bifurcation is not appropriate.

E. The legislature finds and determines that given the complexity and multiparty nature of dwelling actions, it is important to provide a streamlined process for the resolution of construction defect claims and indemnification claims between the seller and the construction professionals that is efficient, economical and convenient for the parties involved. The legislature further finds and determines that for the majority of dwelling actions, bifurcation of the issues of the existence of a defect and causation from the issue of apportionment of fault is more efficient, fair and convenient for the parties.  It is the legislature's intent that the bifurcation process prescribed in subsection D of this section does not alter the seller's liability under the seller's implied warranty to the purchaser. It is the legislature's intent that the bifurcation process prescribed in subsection D of this section be used and that the issues of existence of a construction defect, damages, causation and apportionment of fault be tried in one trial unless the court finds that the circumstances of the particular case at issue render bifurcation inappropriate.

#### Section 12-1363. Notice and right to repair or replace; tolling of time limits; admissible evidence; definition

A. Before filing a dwelling action, the purchaser shall give written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the seller specifying in reasonable detail the basis of the dwelling action.  A seller who receives notice under this subsection shall promptly forward a copy of the notice to the last known address of each construction professional who the seller reasonably believes is responsible for an alleged defect that is specified in the notice. The seller's notice to each construction professional may be delivered by electronic means.

B. After receipt of the notice described in subsection A of this section, the seller and the seller's construction professional may inspect the dwelling to determine the nature and cause of the alleged construction defects and the nature and extent of any repairs or replacements necessary to remedy the alleged construction defects.  The purchaser shall ensure that the dwelling is made available for inspection not later than ten days after the purchaser receives the seller's and the seller's construction professional's request for an inspection. The seller and the seller's construction professional shall provide reasonable notice to the purchaser before conducting the inspection.  The inspection shall be conducted at a reasonable time.  The seller and the seller's construction professional may use reasonable measures, including testing, to determine the nature and cause of the alleged construction defects and the nature and extent of any repairs or replacements necessary to remedy the alleged construction defects. If the seller or the seller's construction professional conduct testing pursuant to this subsection, the seller or the seller's construction professional shall restore the dwelling to its condition before the testing.

C. Within sixty days after receipt of the notice described in subsection A of this section, the seller shall send to the purchaser a good faith written response to the purchaser's notice by certified mail, return receipt requested.  The response may include the seller's and the seller's construction professional's notice of intent to repair or replace any alleged construction defects, to have the alleged construction defects repaired or replaced at the seller's or seller's construction professional's expense or to provide monetary compensation to the purchaser. The written notice of intent to repair or replace shall describe in reasonable detail all repairs or replacements that the seller and the seller's construction professional intend to make or provide to the dwelling and a reasonable estimate of the date by which the repairs or replacements will be made.  This subsection does not prohibit the seller from offering monetary compensation or other consideration instead of or in addition to a repair or replacement. The purchaser may accept or reject an offer of monetary compensation or other consideration, other than repair or replacement and, if rejected, may proceed with a dwelling action on completion of any repairs or replacements the seller and the seller's construction professional intend to make or provide.  The parties may negotiate for a release if an offer involving monetary compensation or other consideration is accepted.

D. If the seller does not provide a written response to the purchaser's notice within sixty days, the purchaser may file a dwelling action.

E. If the response provided pursuant to subsection C of this section includes a notice of intent to repair or replace the alleged construction defects, the purchaser shall allow the seller and the seller's construction professional a reasonable opportunity to repair or replace the alleged construction defects or cause the alleged construction defects to be repaired or replaced pursuant to the following:

1. The purchaser and the seller or the seller's construction professional shall coordinate repairs or replacements within thirty days after the seller's notice of intent to repair or replace was sent pursuant to subsection C of this section. If requested by the purchaser, repair or replacement of alleged construction defects undertaken by the seller shall be performed by a construction professional selected by the seller and consented to by the purchaser, whose consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, that was not involved in the construction or design of the dwelling. A contractor or subcontractor that was not involved in the construction or design of the dwelling and that performs any repair or replacement of the alleged construction defect pursuant to this section is liable only to the seller or purchaser who contracted for the contractor's or subcontractor's services for the contractor's or subcontractor's scope of work and that contractor or subcontractor may be named in an amended notice pursuant to subsection I of this section or in the corresponding dwelling action.

2. Repairs or replacements shall begin as agreed by the purchaser and the seller or the seller's construction professional, with reasonable efforts to begin repairs or replacements within thirty-five days after the seller's notice of intent to repair or replace was sent pursuant to subsection C of this section. If a permit is required to perform the repair or replacement, reasonable efforts shall be made to begin repairs or replacements within ten days after receipt of the permit or thirty-five days after the seller's notice of intent to repair or replace was sent pursuant to subsection C of this section, whichever is later.

3. All repairs or replacements shall be completed using reasonable care under the circumstances and within a commercially reasonable time frame considering the nature of the repair or replacement, any access issues or unforeseen events that are not caused by the seller or the seller's construction professional.

4. The purchaser shall provide reasonable access for the repairs or replacements.

5. The seller is not entitled to a release or waiver solely in exchange for any repair or replacement made pursuant to this subsection, except that the purchaser and seller may negotiate a release or waiver in exchange for monetary compensation or other consideration.

6. At the conclusion of any repairs or replacements, the purchaser may commence a dwelling action or, if the contract for the sale of the dwelling or the community documents contain a commercially reasonable alternative dispute resolution procedure that complies with section 12-1366, subsection C, may initiate the dispute resolution process including any claim for inadequate repair or replacement.

F. During the notice and repair or replacement process, and for thirty days after substantial completion of the repair or replacement, the statute of limitations and statute of repose, including section 12-552, applicable to the purchaser, including any construction professional involved in the construction or design, are tolled as to the seller and the seller's construction professional who were involved in the construction or design of the dwelling for all alleged construction defects described in reasonable detail in the written notice sent to the seller pursuant to subsection A of this section.

G. The statute of limitations and statute of repose, including section 12-552, that apply to the seller's claim for indemnity or contribution against any construction professional is tolled from the date the seller receives the notice required by this section until nine months after the purchaser's service of the civil complaint or arbitration demand on the seller.

H. All parties' conduct during the repair or replacement process prescribed in subsections B, C, D and E of this section may be introduced in any subsequent dwelling action.  Any repair or replacement efforts undertaken by the seller or the seller's construction professional are not considered settlement communications or offers of settlement and are admissible in evidence.

I. A purchaser may amend the notice provided pursuant to subsection A of this section to include alleged construction defects identified in good faith after submission of the original notice. The seller and the seller's construction professional shall have a reasonable period of time to conduct an inspection, if requested, and thereafter the parties shall comply with the requirements of subsections B, C, D and E of this section for the additional alleged construction defects identified in reasonable detail in the notice.

J. Subject to Arizona rules of court, during the pendency of a dwelling action the purchaser may supplement the list of alleged construction defects to include additional alleged construction defects identified in good faith after filing of the original dwelling action that have been identified in reasonable detail as required by this section.  The court shall provide the seller and the seller's construction professional a reasonable amount of time to inspect the dwelling to determine the nature and cause of the additional alleged construction defects and the nature and extent of any repairs or replacements necessary to remedy the additional alleged construction defects and, on request of the seller or the seller's construction professional, sufficient time to repair or replace the additional alleged construction defects. The parties shall comply with the requirements of subsections B, C, D and E of this section for the additional alleged construction defects identified in reasonable detail in the notice.

K. The service of an amended notice identifying in reasonable detail the alleged construction defects during the pendency of a dwelling action shall relate back to the original notice of alleged construction defects for the purpose of tolling applicable statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, including section 12-552.

L. By written agreement of the seller and purchaser, the time periods provided in this section may be extended.

M. For the sale of a dwelling that occurs within the statutory period set forth in section 12-552, the escrow agent, as defined in section 6-801, shall provide notice to the purchaser of the provisions of this section and sections 12-1361 and 12-1362. This subsection does not create a fiduciary duty or provide any person or entity with a private right or cause of action or administrative action.

N. A purchaser who files a contested dwelling action under this article must file an affidavit with the purchaser's complaint, under penalty of perjury, that the purchaser has read the entire complaint, agrees with all of the allegations and facts contained in the complaint and, unless authorized by statute or rule, is not receiving and has not been promised anything of value in exchange for filing the dwelling action.

O. If the seller does not comply with the requirements of this section and the failure is not due to any fault of the purchaser or as a result of an unforeseen condition, including an unforeseen weather condition or government delay, the purchaser may commence a dwelling action.

P. If the purchaser fails to comply with the requirements of this section before bringing a dwelling action, the dwelling action shall be dismissed. If the dwelling action is dismissed after the statute of limitations or statute of repose, including section 12-552, applicable to the purchaser, any subsequent dwelling action brought by the purchaser is time barred as to the seller and the seller's construction professional involved in the construction or design of the dwelling.

Q. For the purposes of this section, "reasonable detail" includes all of the following:

1. An itemized list that describes each alleged construction defect with sufficient detail to allow the seller or seller's construction professional to identify the alleged construction defect.

2. The location that each alleged construction defect has been observed by the purchaser in each dwelling that is the subject of the notice.

3. The impairment to the dwelling that has occurred as a result of each of the alleged construction defects or is reasonably likely to occur if the alleged construction defects are not repaired or replaced.

4. The street address for each dwelling that is the subject of the notice.

#### Section 12-1364. Dwelling actions; contested issues; attorney fees and taxable costs; expert witness fees; definitions

A. In a contested dwelling action, the court or tribunal may award the prevailing party with respect to a contested issue reasonable attorney fees and taxable costs.  A purchaser is deemed the prevailing party with respect to a contested issue if the relief obtained by the purchaser for that contested issue, exclusive of any fees and taxable costs, is more favorable than the repairs or replacements and offers made by the seller before the purchaser filed a dwelling action pursuant to section 12-1363. The seller is deemed the prevailing party with respect to a contested issue if the relief obtained by the purchaser for that contested issue, exclusive of any fees and taxable costs, is not more favorable than the repairs or replacements and offers made by the seller before the purchaser filed a dwelling action pursuant to section 12-1363.

B. An award of attorney fees pursuant to this section is limited to the amount of fees actually and reasonably incurred with respect to the contested issue for which the party has been deemed the prevailing party.  In determining whether the fees actually incurred with respect to a contested issue are reasonable, the court or tribunal shall consider all of the following:

1. The repairs, replacements or offers made by the seller, if any, before the purchaser filed the dwelling action pursuant to section 12-1363.

2. The purchaser's response to the seller's repairs, replacements or offers made or proposed, if any, before the purchaser filed the dwelling action pursuant to section 12-1363.

3. The relation between the fees incurred over the duration of the dwelling action and the value of the relief obtained with respect to the contested issue.

4. The amount of fees incurred in responding to any unsuccessful motions, claims and defenses during the duration of the dwelling action.

C. This section does not alter, prohibit or restrict present or future contracts that may provide for attorney fees or expert witness fees.

D. Notwithstanding any other law, in a contested dwelling action that involves a single purchaser, the court or tribunal may award the prevailing party with respect to the contested issue reasonable expert witness fees. The determination of the prevailing party and the reasonableness of the expert witness fees shall be made using the same criteria used in determining the award of attorney fees pursuant to subsections A and B of this section.  This subsection does not apply to a dwelling action that involves more than one purchaser or an action that is consolidated with any other dwelling action.  The expert witness fees prescribed in this subsection are in addition to the taxable costs authorized by section 12-332.

E. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Contested issue" means an issue that relates to an alleged construction defect and that is contested by a purchaser following the conclusion of the repair and replacement procedures prescribed in section 12-1363.

2. "Purchaser" means any person or entity, including the current owner of the dwelling, who files a dwelling action during the time period described in section 12-552.

#### Section 12-1365. Notification; right to file a complaint with the registrar of contractors

A. A written contract for the sale of a newly constructed dwelling between a buyer of a newly constructed dwelling and the seller responsible for the original construction of the dwelling shall contain, or provide separate notice of, the following provision:

Under Arizona Revised Statutes section 32-1155, a buyer of a dwelling has the right to file a written complaint against the homebuilder with the Arizona registrar of contractors within two years after the close of escrow or actual occupancy, whichever occurs first, for the commission of an act in violation of Arizona Revised Statutes section 32-1154, subsection A.

B. The notice required in subsection A of this section shall be prominently displayed and appear in at least ten point bold type.

C. The buyer of the dwelling is not deemed to have received the notice required pursuant to subsection A of this section unless the buyer initials the notice provision.

 

#### Section 12-1366. Applicability; claims and actions

A. This article does not apply:

1. To personal injury claims.

2. To death claims.

3. To claims for damage to property other than a dwelling.

4. To common law fraud claims.

5. To proceedings brought pursuant to title 32, chapter 10.

6. To claims solely seeking recovery of monies expended for repairs to alleged defects that have been repaired by the purchaser.

B. A dwelling action brought by an association is also subject to title 33, chapter 18.

C. After the repair or replacement process has been completed as prescribed by section 12-1363, this article does not affect either party's ability to enforce any commercially reasonable alternative dispute resolution procedures contained in the contract for the sale of the dwelling or an association's community documents. The seller's election to enforce any commercially reasonable alternative dispute resolution procedures contained in the contract for the sale of the dwelling or an association's community documents does not negate, abridge or otherwise reduce the seller's right to repair or replace any alleged construction defects pursuant to section 12-1363.  If the contract for the sale of a dwelling contains the procedures, the procedures shall conspicuously appear in the contract in bold and capital letters and a disclosure statement in at least twelve-point font, bold and capital letters shall appear on the face of the contract and shall describe the location of the alternative dispute resolution procedures within the contract.

#### Section 12-1502. Proceedings to compel or stay arbitration

A. On application of a party showing an agreement described in section 12-1501, and the opposing party's refusal to arbitrate, the court shall order the parties to proceed with arbitration, but if the opposing party denies the existence of the agreement to arbitrate, the court shall proceed summarily to the determination of the issue so raised and shall order arbitration if found for the moving party.

If found for the opposing party, the court shall order the parties to proceed to arbitration.

C. If an issue referable to arbitration under the alleged agreement is involved in an action or proceeding pending in a court having jurisdiction to hear applications under subsection A of this section, the application shall be made therein.

When the application is made in such action or proceeding, the order for arbitration shall include such stay.

E. An order for arbitration shall not be refused on the ground that the claim in issue lacks merit or bona fides or because any fault or grounds for the claim sought to be arbitrated have not been shown.

#### Section 12-1503. Appointment of arbitrators by court

If the arbitration agreement provides a method of appointment of arbitrators, this method shall be followed. In the absence thereof, or if the agreed method fails or for any reason cannot be followed, or when an arbitrator appointed fails or is unable to act and his successor has not been duly appointed, the court on application of a party shall appoint one or more arbitrators. An arbitrator so appointed has all the powers of one specifically named in the agreement.

Unless otherwise provided by the agreement:

1. The arbitrators shall appoint a time and place for the hearing and cause notification to the parties to be served personally or by registered mail not less than five days before the hearing.

The arbitrators may adjourn the hearing from time to time as necessary and, on request of a party and for good cause, or upon their own motion, may postpone the hearing to a time not later than the date fixed by the agreement for making the award unless the parties consent to a later date. The arbitrators may hear and determine the controversy upon the evidence produced notwithstanding the failure of a party duly notified to appear. The court on application may direct the arbitrators to proceed promptly with the hearing and determination of the controversy.

2. The parties are entitled to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing.

3. The hearing shall be conducted by all the arbitrators but a majority may determine any question and render a final award.

#### Section 12-1506. Representation by attorney

#### Section 12-1507. Witnesses; subpoenas; depositions

A. The arbitrators may cause to be issued subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and for the production of books, records, documents and other evidence, and shall have the power to administer oaths.  Subpoenas so issued shall be served, and, upon application to the court by a party or the arbitrators, enforced, in the manner provided by law for the service and enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action.

B. On application of a party and for use as evidence, the arbitrators may permit a deposition to be taken, in the manner and upon the terms designated by the arbitrators, of a witness who cannot be subpoenaed or is unable to attend the hearing.

C. All provisions of law compelling a person under subpoena to testify are applicable.

D. Fees for attendance as a witness shall be the same as for a witness in the superior courts of the state of Arizona.

B. An award shall be made within the time fixed therefor by the agreement or, if not so fixed, within such time as the court orders on application of a party. The parties may extend the time in writing either before or after the expiration thereof. A party waives the objection that an award was not made within the time required unless he notifies the arbitrators of his objection prior to the delivery of the award to him.

#### Section 12-1509. Change of award by arbitrators

On application of a party or, if an application to the court is pending under sections 12-1511, 12-1512, or 12-1513, on submission to the arbitrators by the court under such conditions as the court may order, the arbitrators may modify or correct the award upon the grounds stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of subsection A of section 12-1513, or for the purpose of clarifying the award. The application shall be made within twenty days after delivery of the award to the applicant. Written notice thereof shall be given forthwith to the opposing party, stating he must serve his objections thereto, if any, within ten days from the notice. The award so modified or corrected is subject to the provisions of sections 12-1511, 12-1512 and 12-1513.

#### Section 12-1510. Fees and expenses of arbitration

Unless otherwise provided in the agreement to arbitrate, the arbitrators' expenses and fees, together with other expenses, not including counsel fees, incurred in the conduct of the arbitration, shall be paid as provided in the award.

#### Section 12-1511. Confirmation of an award

A party seeking confirmation of an award shall file and serve an application therefor in the same manner in which complaints are filed and served in civil actions. Upon the expiration of twenty days from service of the application, which shall be made upon the party against whom the award has been made, the court shall enter judgment upon the award unless opposition is made in accordance with section 12-1512.

#### Section 12-1512. Opposition to an award

2. There was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral or corruption in any of the arbitrators or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;

3. The arbitrators exceeded their powers;

4. The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or refused to hear evidence material to the controversy or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of section 12-1505, as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party; or

5. There was no arbitration agreement and the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under section 12-1502 and the adverse party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection; but the fact that the relief was such that it could not or would not be granted by a court of law or equity is not ground for vacating or refusing to confirm the award.

B. In declining to confirm an award on grounds other than stated in paragraph 5 of subsection A the court may order a rehearing before new arbitrators chosen as provided in the agreement, or in the absence thereof, by the court in accordance with section 12-1503, or if the court declines to confirm the award on grounds set forth in paragraphs 3 and 4 of subsection A the court may order a rehearing before the arbitrators who made the award or their successors appointed in accordance with section 12-1503. The time within which the agreement requires the award to be made is applicable to the rehearing and commences from the date of the order.

A. Upon application made within ninety days after delivery of a copy of the award to the applicant, if judgment has not been entered thereon, the court shall modify or correct the award where:

1. There was an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to in the award;

2. The arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the issues submitted; or

3. The award is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the controversy.

B. If the application is granted, the court shall modify and correct the award so as to effect its intent and shall confirm the award as so modified and corrected. Otherwise, the court shall confirm the award as made.

C. An application to modify or correct an award may be joined in the alternative with an application to vacate the award.

D. After judgment, the award shall be subject to the powers of the court in the same manner as any other judgment which may be subject to review under rule 60(c) of the rules of civil procedure.

#### Section 12-1514. Judgment or decree on award

Upon the granting of an order confirming, modifying or correcting an award, judgment or decree shall be entered in confirmity therewith and be enforced as any other judgment or decree. Costs of the application and of the proceedings subsequent thereto, and disbursements may be awarded by the court.

#### Section 12-1515. Applications to court

Except as otherwise provided, an application to the court under this article shall be by motion and shall be heard in the manner and upon the notice provided by law or rule of court for the making and hearing of motions. Unless the parties have agreed otherwise, notice of an initial application for an order shall be served in the manner provided by law for the service of a summons in an action.

#### Section 12-1516. Court; jurisdiction and venue

The term "court", as used in this article, means the superior courts of the state of Arizona, and venue of the appropriate superior court shall be determined as in any other civil action.  The initial application having been made to a court of appropriate venue, all subsequent applications shall be made to the same court unless that court otherwise directs.

B. In ascertaining whether the property is in danger of serious and immediate waste or decay or that keeping of the property until trial will result in such expense or deterioration in value as greatly to lessen the amount likely to be realized therefrom, the court or justice of the peace may require or dispense with notice to the parties and may act upon such information, by affidavit, certificate of the attaching officer or other proof, as appears sufficient to protect the interest of the parties.

#### Section 12-1566. Execution upon judgments for debts secured by real property; fair market value; hearing; redemption rights; guarantees; applicability

A. This section applies to execution upon real property under a judgment obtained pursuant to section 33-725 or obtained pursuant to section 33-814 or obtained against a guarantor or any other person directly, indirectly or contingently liable on a debt for which a judgment under section 33-725 or 33-814 may be obtained.

B. Any sale of real property under this section shall be a credit on the amount of the judgment in the amount of either the fair market value of the real property determined under subsection C of this section or the sales price of the real property at a sheriff's sale, whichever is greater.

C. Any judgment debtor against whom a judgment has been entered pursuant to section 33-725 or 33-814 may, not later than thirty days after sale of the real property, file a written application with the court for determination of the fair market value of the real property which has been sold. Notice of filing the application and of the hearing shall be given to all parties to the action. The fair market value shall be determined by the court at a priority hearing which shall be held upon such evidence as the court may allow. The court shall issue an order crediting the amount due on the judgment with the greater of the sales price or the fair market value of the real property. Fair market value shall mean the most probable price, as of the date of the execution sale, in cash, or in terms equivalent to cash, or in other precisely revealed terms, after deduction of prior liens and encumbrances with interest to the date of sale, for which the real property or interest therein would sell after reasonable exposure in the market under conditions requisite to a fair sale, with the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably and for self-interest, and assuming that neither is under duress. If an application has been filed, there shall be no right to redemption as to the real property sold as provided in sections 12-1281, 12-1282 and 12-1283, except creditors having a junior lien to the lien foreclosed may redeem by five day successive periods as provided in section 12-1282, subsection C, commencing sixty days after the sale of the real property. The redemption price shall be calculated on the sales price of the real property.

D. Except when the primary residence has been given as security pursuant to a mortgage or deed of trust, no primary residence occupied by a judgment debtor covered by subsection A of this section may be sold under execution until all other sales under execution of real property of the judgment debtor in this state have been held and, if timely requested, the hearing pursuant to subsection C of this section has been held. The judgment debtor, within thirty days after entry of judgment, may file with the court a certified list and legal description of the debtor's real property within thirty days after entry of the judgment. This subsection shall not apply to any real property which the judgment holder does not have actual knowledge of at the time of entry of judgment or real property not listed on a certified list filed by the judgment debtor. This subsection shall not require the judgment holder to sell real property which the judgment holder has released from the judgment lien.

E. The obligation of a guarantor may be enforced without regard to this section in accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract between the lender and the guarantor in an action independent of any other action or judgment. A guarantor of the debt or any other person directly, indirectly or contingently liable for the debt who is not a judgment debtor in an action for foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust or an action for deficiency judgment shall receive the same credit as the judgment debtor receives pursuant to this section or section 33-814.

F. This section shall not abate, suspend or bar the right of the holder of a debt secured by real property to abandon and release the lien on the real property which secures the debt and proceed against any borrower or guarantor. Abandonment and release shall be evidenced by a recorded release of the lien.

G. This section shall not abate, suspend or bar any action of the holder of the judgment to realize upon or satisfy the judgment from personal property of a judgment debtor or guarantor or any other person directly, indirectly or contingently liable for the debt.

H. The sheriff's deed given pursuant to a sale held under execution or a trustee's deed upon sale under power of sale shall constitute conclusive evidence of the meeting of such requirements in favor of purchasers or encumbrancers for value and without actual notice that any requirements of this section have not been met.

I. For the purposes of subsection D of this section:

1. "Primary residence" means a real property of two and one-half acres or less which is limited to and utilized for either a single one-family or a single two-family dwelling.

The opposing party shall include with the motion to compel satisfaction of the judgment an affidavit that evidences proof of payment and, if necessary, the due diligence that was performed in attempting to locate the prevailing party. If the motion is granted, the judgment is deemed satisfied.

Notice to judgment debtor or defendant

(Non-earnings)

You are hereby notified that this court has issued an order in the above case in favor of the judgment creditor in this proceeding, directing that some of your money, property or corporate shares or interest be used to satisfy some of your debt to the judgment creditor. The order was issued to enforce the judgment creditor's judgment, support order or provisional remedy order against you that was obtained in (the name of court) in (case number) on (date). A copy of the judgment or order is attached.

The law provides that monies from certain benefits or in certain amounts are free from the claims of creditors even if deposited in a bank, savings and loan association or credit union. Some examples of exempt monies appear later in this notice. The law also provides that certain personal property is exempt from the claims of creditors. Some examples of exempt property appear later in this notice.

Within ten days after being served with the writ of garnishment the garnishee who is holding your money or personal property is required to mail or deliver to you his answer stating what money or personal property he is withholding from you for the judgment creditor pursuant to the writ.

You may object to the garnishment or file a claim of exemption by requesting a hearing with this court, if you believe any of the following is true:

1. The judgment creditor does not have a valid provisional remedy order or support order or judgment against you or that the debt or judgment has been paid in full.

2. Some or all of the monies which are being withheld by the garnishee may be exempt monies. Examples of exempt monies are:

(a) One hundred fifty dollars in a bank, savings and loan association or credit union account. (Three hundred dollars for married account holders.)

(b) Temporary assistance for needy families.

(c) Supplemental security income (SSI).

(d) Social security benefits (SSA).

(e) United States department of veterans affairs benefits (VA).

(f) Certain pension benefits and retirement funds.

(g) Workers' compensation benefits.

(h) Some insurance proceeds.

Other state and federal exemptions may apply. Certain exemptions may not apply to support orders or to the collection of taxes. An attorney can assist you in determining what monies are exempt.

3. Some or all of the personal property being withheld by the garnishee may be exempt property. Examples of exempt personal property are:

(a) Household goods, furniture and appliances.

(b) Up to one thousand five hundred dollars equity value for each owner of a car or truck. (Three thousand dollars equity value if the owner has a physical disability.)

(c) Wearing apparel, musical instruments, televisions or stereos and other personal items.

(d) Tools and equipment used in a commercial activity, trade, business or profession.

These exemptions are limited in statute by description and dollar value. An attorney can assist you in determining what personal property is exempt.

4. More than fifteen days have passed since the garnishee was served with the writ and you have not yet received the garnishee's answer.

5. You otherwise disagree with the answer of the garnishee. To request a hearing, deliver the request for hearing form appearing below, or a substantially similar form, to the court clerk's office. At the same time, you must mail or deliver a copy (photocopy or handwritten copy) of the request for hearing to the judgment creditor and the garnishee at the address stated in the writ. If you do not deliver the request for hearing form to this court within ten days after the date you receive the answer of garnishee, your request for hearing will be denied, unless a good reason for the delay, acceptable to the court, is shown.

If you request a hearing it will be held no later than five days, not including weekends and holidays, after your request is received by the court. If appropriate, you may request a hearing before the garnishee files his answer.

The court will notify you and the other parties of the time and date of the hearing. You may attend the hearing with or without an attorney.

The judgment creditor shall deliver to the garnishee sufficient copies of the appropriate nonexempt earnings statement and request for hearing forms so that the garnishee is able to comply with the requirements of this section, unless the judgment creditor is advised that the garnishee will supply his own forms.

#### Section 12-1598.12. Reporting by judgment creditor

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, as long as the order of continuing lien is in effect the judgment creditor shall issue a report in writing to the garnishee and the judgment debtor within twenty-one days after the end of each calendar quarter.

B. The judgment creditor shall report in writing to the garnishee and judgment debtor within twenty-one days after payment is received from the garnishee reducing the outstanding balance on the judgment to $500 or less and within the first ten days of each calendar month thereafter until the judgment is satisfied.

C. The reports required in subsections A and B of this section shall contain the following:

1. The beginning and ending date of the reporting period for that report. The beginning date of the first reporting period is the date the writ was served.

Reasonable action includes at least written notice directed to the garnishee or the garnishee's authorized representative if the balance due on the judgment is less than double the amount of nonexempt earnings received in the preceding two pay periods.  The judgment creditor shall instruct the garnishee to cease withholding earnings after the full amount of the judgment has been paid to the judgment creditor or when the judgment creditor has been notified that sufficient monies have been withheld to satisfy the underlying judgment.

E. Immediately after the underlying judgment is satisfied or expires, the judgment creditor shall file with the clerk of the court a satisfaction or release of the writ and shall deliver a copy of that satisfaction or release to the garnishee, the judgment debtor and any creditor who has delivered a written request for such a notice to the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney.

#### Section 12-1598.13. Contempt proceedings; default of garnishee

A. If the judgment creditor fails to comply with any duty imposed upon him by this article, the court shall, upon petition of any party to the proceedings affected by such failure and after notice, hold a hearing to determine whether such failure to comply, if any, was occasioned by mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect. If the court determines that any failure to comply was not the result of mistake, inadvertence or excusable neglect, the court shall find the judgment creditor in contempt and shall award the petitioner all of the following:

1. An amount to compensate for actual losses, if any, caused by the failure to comply.

2. Reasonable attorney fees, if the petitioner was represented by an attorney at such hearing.

3. Court costs.

4. An additional amount of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars.

B. If a garnishee fails after written notice to deliver nonexempt earnings to the judgment creditor within thirty days after the ending date of the pay period, or fails after written notice to deliver the nonexempt earnings statement to the judgment debtor with the exempt earnings, the judgment debtor may petition the court for relief. The court shall, after notice, hold a hearing to determine if such failure, if any, was wilful or the result of gross negligence. If the court determines that the failure was wilful or the result of gross negligence, the court shall find the garnishee in contempt and shall award the judgment debtor all of the following:

1. An amount to compensate for actual losses, if any, caused by the failure to comply.

2. Reasonable attorney fees, if the judgment debtor was represented by an attorney at such hearing.

3. Court costs. The court may award the judgment debtor an additional amount not to exceed four hundred dollars.

C. While an order of continuing lien pursuant to section 12-1598.10 is in effect, if the garnishee fails to deliver to the judgment creditor the nonexempt earnings of the judgment debtor, if any, and the copy of the nonexempt earnings statement within fourteen days of the end of the pertinent pay period, and the judgment creditor thereafter delivers a written demand for the nonexempt earnings and statement, and the garnishee does not comply within fourteen days of the receipt of the written demand, the judgment creditor may petition the court for relief. The court shall, after notice, hold a hearing to determine whether the failure to comply with the written demand within fourteen days of receipt, if any, was wilful or the result of gross negligence. If the court determines that the failure was wilful or the result of gross negligence, the court shall find the garnishee in contempt and shall award the judgment creditor all of the following:

1. An amount to compensate for actual losses, if any, caused by the failure to comply.

2. Reasonable attorney fees, if the judgment creditor was represented by an attorney at such hearing.

3. Court costs. The court may award the judgment creditor an additional amount not to exceed four hundred dollars.

D. If after conducting a hearing required by subsection A, B or C of this section, the court determines that a petition filed pursuant to subsection A, B or C of this section is without merit, the court may award reasonable attorney fees to any party adversely affected by the petition, if the party adversely affected was represented by an attorney at such hearing.

E. A party may request the court to order the relief set forth in subsection A, B, C or D of this section in the case which is the basis of the garnishment.

F. This section does not restrict a party from pursuing any common law remedies.

G. The garnishee may conclusively rely on and is not liable to the judgment debtor for acting in reliance on the validity and authenticity of a garnishment which is regular on its face.

H. If a garnishee fails to answer within the time specified in the writ, the party for whom the writ has been issued may petition the court for the issuance of an order requiring the garnishee to appear before the court at a time and place specified in the order to answer the writ or to file and serve a copy of the answer on the party for whom the writ has been issued, or on his attorney if the party is represented by counsel, at least five days before the appearance date. If the garnishee fails to appear or file and serve the answer after the service of the order requiring the appearance in person or answer on the garnishee, the court may render judgment by default against the garnishee for the full amount of the judgment against the judgment debtor. The court may award a reasonable attorney's fee to the party for whom the writ was issued and against the garnishee if the writ was not answered within the time specified in the writ and a petition requiring the garnishee to appear or answer was filed as provided in this section.

#### Section 12-1598.14. Priority

A. Except as provided in subsections B and C, conflicting wage garnishments and levies rank according to priority in time of service.

B. Garnishments, levies and wage assignments which are not for the support of a person are inferior to wage assignments for the support of a person. Garnishments which are not for the support of a person and levies are inferior to garnishments for the support of a person.

C. If a judgment debtor's earnings become subject to more than one writ of garnishment pursuant to this article, and because of the application of the priorities set forth in subsections A and B a judgment creditor recovers no nonexempt earnings for two consecutive paydays, the lien on earnings of such judgment creditor is invalid and of no force and effect, and the garnishee shall notify the judgment creditor accordingly.

#### Section 12-1598.15. Taxing costs

A. If the garnishee is discharged on the garnishee's answer, the cost of the proceeding, including reasonable compensation to the garnishee, shall be taxed against the judgment creditor.

B. If there is no written objection to the answer of the garnishee and the garnishee is held on the garnishee's answer, the attorney fees that are allowed by section 12-1598.03, paragraph 3 and costs as provided in subsection A of this section shall be taxed against the judgment debtor.

C. If the answer or nonexempt earnings statement is objected to in writing the attorney fees and costs shall abide the issue.

D. If no objection is filed to the answer of the garnishee, the costs provided in subsections A and B of this section shall not exceed $50 excluding costs of service and the cost of issuance of the writ.

E. While a continuing lien is in effect the garnishee may deduct from the nonexempt earnings of the judgment debtor the amount of $5 each pay period as a fee for preparing and delivering the nonexempt earnings statement. If there were not sufficient nonexempt earnings to collect this fee, and an amount arising from this fee remains owing when the writ becomes invalid or is released, the amount is chargeable against the judgment creditor and not the judgment debtor.

#### Section 12-1598.16. Forms

A. The court, justice of the peace or city or town magistrate shall provide to the parties, at no charge, copies of the following documents:

1. The initial notice to judgment debtor and request for hearing form required to be delivered pursuant to section 12-1598.04.

(b) Grounds for objecting to the writ.

(c) The objection and hearing procedures.

2. A form on which the judgment debtor may request a hearing.

C. The initial notice to judgment debtor and request for hearing form prescribed by the supreme court shall be in substantially the following form:

Initial notice to judgment debtor

To collect his judgment against you the judgment creditor has asked this court to issue a writ of garnishment (see copy of writ attached). Information about the judgment and the name and address of the judgment creditor and garnishee are stated in the writ and the copy of the judgment, which is attached.

The writ of garnishment is a court order requiring the garnishee to withhold a certain amount from your earnings and to continue to withhold a portion of your earnings until the judgment is satisfied or the writ is quashed by the court or released by the judgment creditor.

The law provides that a certain amount of each paycheck or other earnings is exempt from collection by a writ of garnishment. In some cases of very low income no amount can be garnished except for an order for support of a person. Different exemption rights may apply to the collection of taxes.

Within ten days after the date the garnishee was served with the writ of garnishment, he is required to deliver to you the following documents:

1. Answer of garnishee.

2. Notice to judgment debtor, which explains your rights and the procedures in the garnishment process.

3. Request for hearing form, which you can use to request a hearing if you believe that the amount withheld from your earnings is greater than the law allows or that the garnishment is invalid.

On each normal payday you should receive some earnings (paycheck) for the amount the garnishee calculates is protected by law. That calculation is made on a nonexempt earnings statement, a copy of which should accompany your paycheck. If the judgment creditor's debt is subject to an effective agreement for debt scheduling between you and a qualified debt counseling organization and if you do not receive a paycheck, or if a copy of the nonexempt earnings statement does not accompany your paycheck, you may request a hearing.

To request a hearing for the reasons described above, fill out the attached request for hearing form and deliver it to this court's clerk's office. At the same time you must deliver a copy (photocopy or handwritten) of the request for hearing to the garnishee and to the judgment creditor, or his attorney, at the address stated on the writ of garnishment.

You will also be given an opportunity to request a hearing after you receive the answer of garnishee. A request for hearing can be made no later than ten days after you receive the answer of garnishee, unless good cause is shown why the request was filed later.

If you request a hearing, the court or justice of the peace will set the hearing within ten days of the date you submitted your request for hearing, and the court will notify you, the judgment creditor and the garnishee of the date, time and place of the hearing.

Request for hearing

I request a hearing because:

_____ On my normal payday I received no earnings (paycheck).

_____ A copy of the nonexempt earnings statement did not accompany my paycheck.

_____ The judgment creditor does not have a valid judgment against me or that judgment has been paid in full.

_____ My employer has not delivered to me the notice to judgment debtor answer of garnishee (employer) and request for hearing forms within fifteen days.

_____ The debt of the judgment creditor is subject to an effective agreement for debt scheduling between me and a qualified debt counseling organization.

D. At the top of the first page of the initial notice to judgment debtor described in subsections C and E of this section a Spanish translation shall be printed of the language below:

 

The court has issued an order for your employer to take part of your salary and pay your creditor until the judgment against you is paid off. According to the law, your creditor has a right to only part of your salary. Below there is an explanation of your rights. A written Spanish translation of the notice below can be obtained at the court.

E. The notice to judgment debtor and request for hearing form shall be in a form prescribed by the supreme court and shall contain at a minimum the following:

1. An explanation of the judgment debtor's rights and responsibilities relating to the garnishment procedure, including information concerning:

(a) Exemption rights.

(b) Grounds for objecting to the writ.

(c) The objection and hearing procedures.

2. A form on which the judgment debtor may request a hearing.

F. The notice to judgment debtor and request for hearing form prescribed by the supreme court shall be in substantially the following form:

Notice to judgment debtor

This is your second notice that a writ of garnishment has been issued in this case. The writ is a court order requiring the garnishee to withhold a certain amount from your earnings and to continue to withhold a portion of your earnings until the judgment is satisfied or the writ is quashed.

The law provides that a certain amount of each paycheck or other periodic earnings is exempt from collection by a writ of garnishment. In some cases of very low income no amount can be garnished except for an order for support of a person.

If you believe that too much of your earnings have been withheld from your paycheck or that no amount should be withheld you may request a hearing before this court. Among the reasons for requesting a hearing are:

1. The judgment creditor does not have a valid judgment against you or the judgment has been paid in full.

2. The garnishee's answer is incorrect.

3. Your earnings are already subject to a writ of garnishment or are subject to a court ordered assignment for payment of support.

4. The judgment creditor's debt is subject to an effective agreement for debt scheduling between you and a qualified debt counseling organization.

To request a hearing, deliver the request for hearing form appearing below, or a substantially similar form, to the clerk of this court or the justice of the peace. You must mail or deliver a copy of the request for hearing to the garnishee and to the judgment creditor or his attorney at the address on the writ of garnishment.

If you do not deliver the request for hearing form to this court within ten days after the date you receive this notice and the answer of the garnishee, your request for hearing will be denied, unless good cause for the delay is shown. You must check a box or state your reasons for disputing the claim in the space provided on the form.

If you request a hearing, it will be conducted no later than ten days after your request is received by the court. The court will send you notice of the date, time and place.

The nonexempt portion of your earnings will continue to be withheld by the garnishee and delivered to the judgment creditor until the judgment is paid in full, or the garnishment is ordered to stop. Whether or not you request a hearing at this time, if you believe too much money is withheld from your earnings pursuant to this garnishment at some time in the future, you will have the same opportunity to request a hearing at that time.

Request for hearing

I request a hearing because:

 

_____ The judgment creditor does not have a valid judgment against me.

_____ The judgment has been paid in full.

_____ The garnishee's answer is incorrect.

_____ My earnings are already subject to a writ of garnishment or court ordered assignment for payment of support.

_____ Other: ___________________________________________________________.

#### Section 12-1704. Stay of enforcement of judgment

B. If the judgment debtor shows the superior court any ground upon which enforcement of a judgment of any superior court of this state would be stayed, the court shall stay enforcement of the foreign judgment for an appropriate period, upon requiring the same security for satisfaction of the judgment which is required in this state.

C. No execution or other process for enforcement of a foreign judgment filed under section 12-1702 shall issue until twenty days after the date the judgment creditor mails the notice of filing of the foreign judgment and files proof of mailing with the clerk as required under section 12-1703.

C. A copy of the complaint, or, when granted upon affidavit, a copy of the affidavit, shall be served with the injunction.

#### Section 12-1804. Notice of hearing on injunction; service upon adverse party

#### Section 12-1806. Limitations on injunction to stay execution on judgments

A. An injunction to stay an execution upon a valid and subsisting judgment shall not be granted after expiration of one year from the rendition of the judgment, unless it appears that an application for the injunction has been delayed in consequence of the fraud or false promises of the party recovering the judgment, practiced or made at the time of, or after rendition of the judgment, or unless for some equitable matter or defense arising after rendition of such judgment.

B. If the applicant was absent from the state at the time the judgment was rendered, and was unable to apply for the injunction within the time provided in subsection A, of this section, the injunction may be granted at any time within two years from rendition of the judgment.

#### Section 12-1809. Injunction against harassment; petition; venue; fees; notices; enforcement; definition

A. A person may file a verified petition with a magistrate, justice of the peace or superior court judge for an injunction prohibiting harassment. If the person is a minor, the parent, legal guardian or person who has legal custody of the minor shall file the petition unless the court determines otherwise. The petition shall name the parent, guardian or custodian as the plaintiff, and the minor is a specifically designated person for the purposes of subsection F of this section. If a person is either temporarily or permanently unable to request an injunction, a third party may request an injunction on behalf of the plaintiff.  After the request, the judicial officer shall determine if the third party is an appropriate requesting party for the plaintiff. Notwithstanding the location of the plaintiff or defendant, any court in this state may issue or enforce an injunction against harassment.

B. An injunction against harassment shall not be granted:

1. Unless the party who requests the injunction files a written verified petition for injunction.

2. Against a person who is less than twelve years of age unless the injunction is granted by the juvenile division of the superior court.

3. Against more than one defendant.

C. The petition shall state all of the following:

1. The name of the plaintiff. The plaintiff's address and contact information shall be disclosed to the court for purposes of service and notification.  The address and contact information shall not be listed on the petition. Whether or not the court issues an injunction against harassment, the plaintiff's address and contact information shall be maintained in a separate document or automated database and is not subject to release or disclosure by the court or any form of public access except as ordered by the court.

2. The name and address, if known, of the defendant.

3. A specific statement showing events and dates of the acts constituting the alleged harassment.

4. The name of the court in which there was or is any prior or pending proceeding or order concerning the conduct that is sought to be restrained.

5. The relief requested.

D. A fee shall not be charged for filing a petition under this section.  Fees for service of process may be deferred or waived under any rule or law applicable to civil actions, except that fees for service of process shall not be charged if the petition arises out of sexual violence as defined in section 23-371.  The court shall advise a plaintiff that the plaintiff may be eligible for the deferral or waiver of these fees at the time the plaintiff files a petition.  The court shall not require the plaintiff to perform community restitution as a condition of the waiver or deferral of fees for service of process. A law enforcement agency or constable shall not require the advance payment of fees for service of process of injunctions against harassment.  If the court does not waive the fees, the serving agency may assess the actual fees against the plaintiff. On request of the plaintiff, an injunction against harassment that is issued by a municipal court may be served by the police agency for that city if the defendant can be served within the city. If the defendant cannot be served within the city, the police agency in the city in which the defendant can be served may serve the injunction. On request of the plaintiff, each injunction against harassment that is issued by a justice of the peace shall be served by the constable for that jurisdiction if the defendant can be served within the jurisdiction. If the defendant cannot be served within that jurisdiction, the constable in the jurisdiction in which the defendant can be served shall serve the injunction. On request of the plaintiff, an injunction against harassment that is issued by a superior court judge or commissioner may be served by the sheriff of the county. If the defendant cannot be served within that jurisdiction, the sheriff in the jurisdiction in which the defendant can be served may serve the order. The court shall provide, without charge, forms for purposes of this section for assisting parties without counsel.

E. The court shall review the petition, any other pleadings on file and any evidence offered by the plaintiff, including any evidence of harassment by electronic contact or communication, to determine whether the injunction requested should issue without a further hearing. Rules 65(a)(1) and 65(e) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure do not apply to injunctions that are requested pursuant to this section. If the court finds reasonable evidence of harassment of the plaintiff by the defendant during the year preceding the filing of the petition or that good cause exists to believe that great or irreparable harm would result to the plaintiff if the injunction is not granted before the defendant or the defendant's attorney can be heard in opposition and the court finds specific facts attesting to the plaintiff's efforts to give notice to the defendant or reasons supporting the plaintiff's claim that notice should not be given, the court shall issue an injunction as provided in subsection F of this section. If the court denies the requested relief, it may schedule a further hearing within ten days with reasonable notice to the defendant.  For the purposes of determining the one-year period, any time that the defendant has been incarcerated or out of this state shall not be counted.

F. If the court issues an injunction, the court may do any of the following:

1. Enjoin the defendant from committing a violation of one or more acts of harassment.

2. Restrain the defendant from contacting the plaintiff or other specifically designated persons and from coming near the residence, place of employment or school of the plaintiff or other specifically designated locations or persons.

3. Grant relief necessary for the protection of the alleged victim and other specifically designated persons proper under the circumstances.

G. The court shall not grant a mutual injunction against harassment.  If opposing parties separately file verified petitions for an injunction against harassment, the courts after consultation between the judicial officers involved may consolidate the petitions of the opposing parties for hearing. This does not prohibit a court from issuing cross injunctions against harassment.

H. At any time during the period during which the injunction is in effect, the defendant is entitled to one hearing on written request. A fee may not be charged for requesting a hearing. A hearing that is requested by a defendant shall be held within ten days from the date requested unless the court finds compelling reasons to continue the hearing. The hearing shall be held at the earliest possible time. An ex parte injunction that is issued under this section shall state on its face that the defendant is entitled to a hearing on written request and shall include the name and address of the judicial office where the request may be filed. After the hearing, the court may modify, quash or continue the injunction.

I. The injunction shall include the following statement:

Warning

This is an official court order. If you disobey this order, you may be arrested and prosecuted for the crime of interfering with judicial proceedings and any other crime you may have committed in disobeying this order.

J. An injunction that is not served on the defendant within one year after the date that the injunction is issued expires.  The injunction is effective on the defendant on service of a copy of the injunction and petition and expires one year after service on the defendant.  A modified injunction is effective on service and expires one year after service of the initial injunction and petition.

K. A supplemental information form that is used solely for the purposes of service of process on the defendant and that contains information provided by the plaintiff is confidential.

L. Each affidavit, declaration, acceptance or return of service shall be filed as soon as practicable but not later than seventy-two hours, excluding weekends and holidays, with the clerk of the issuing court or as otherwise required by court rule. This filing shall be completed in person, electronically or by fax.

M. The supreme court shall maintain a central repository for injunctions.  Within twenty-four hours after the affidavit, declaration, acceptance or return of service has been filed, excluding weekends and holidays, the court from which the injunction or any modified injunction was issued shall enter the order and proof of service into the supreme court's central repository for injunctions. The supreme court shall register the injunction with the national crime information center. The effectiveness of an injunction does not depend on its registration, and for enforcement purposes pursuant to section 13-2810, a copy of an injunction, whether or not registered, is presumed to be a valid existing order of the court for a period of one year from the date of service of the injunction on the defendant.

N. A peace officer, with or without a warrant, may arrest a person if the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person has violated section 13-2810 by disobeying or resisting an injunction that is issued pursuant to this section, whether or not the violation occurred in the presence of the officer.  The provisions for release under section 13-3903 do not apply to an arrest made pursuant to this subsection.

A. An employer or an authorized agent of an employer may file a written verified petition with a magistrate, justice of the peace or superior court judge for an injunction prohibiting workplace harassment.

B. The court shall not grant an injunction against workplace harassment against either:

1. A person who is under twelve years of age unless the injunction is granted by the juvenile division of the superior court.

2. More than one defendant.

C. The petition shall state all of the following:

D. The filing fee for a petition that is filed pursuant to this section is established pursuant to sections 12-284, 22-281 and 22-404.

E. The court shall review the petition and any evidence offered by the employer to determine whether to issue the injunction without further hearing.  Rules 65(a)(1) and 65(e) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure do not apply to injunctions requested pursuant to this section.  If the court finds reasonable evidence of workplace harassment by the defendant or that good cause exists to believe that great or irreparable harm would result to the employer or any other person who enters the employer's property or who is performing official work duties or if the injunction is not granted before the defendant or the defendant's attorney can be heard in opposition and the court finds specific facts that attest to the employer's efforts to give notice to the defendant or reasons supporting the employer's claim that notice should not be given, the court shall issue an injunction pursuant to subsection F of this section.  If the court denies the requested relief, the court may schedule a further hearing within ten days with reasonable notice to the defendant.

F. If the court grants an injunction against workplace harassment, the court may do any of the following:

1. Restrain the defendant from coming near the employer's property or place of business and restrain the defendant from contacting the employer or other person while that person is on or at the employer's property or place of business or is performing official work duties.

G. If the court issues an ex parte injunction pursuant to this section, the injunction shall state on its face that the defendant is entitled to a hearing on written request and shall include the name and address of the judicial office in which the request may be filed.  At any time during the period that the injunction is in effect, the defendant may request a hearing. The court shall hold the hearing within ten days after the date of the written request unless the court finds compelling reasons to continue the hearing. The hearing shall be held at the earliest possible time. After the hearing, the court may modify, quash or continue the injunction.

H. An injunction against workplace harassment that is issued pursuant to this section shall include the following statement:

Warning

This is an official court order. If you disobey this order, you may be arrested and prosecuted for the crime of interfering with judicial proceedings and any other crime you may have committed in disobeying this order.

I. An injunction that is not served on the defendant within one year after the date that the injunction is issued expires.  The injunction is effective on the defendant on service of a copy of the injunction and petition and expires one year after service on the defendant.  A modified injunction is effective on service and expires one year after service of the initial injunction and petition.

J. A supplemental information form that is used solely for the purposes of service of process on the defendant and that contains information provided by the plaintiff is confidential.

K. Each affidavit, declaration, acceptance or return of service shall be filed as soon as practicable but not later than seventy-two hours, excluding weekends and holidays, with the clerk of the issuing court or as otherwise required by court rule.  The filing shall be completed in person, electronically or by fax.

The supreme court shall maintain a central repository for injunctions.  Within twenty-four hours after the affidavit, declaration, acceptance or return of service has been filed, excluding weekends and holidays, the court that issued the injunction shall enter the order and proof of service into the supreme court's central repository for injunctions.  The supreme court shall register a copy of the injunction and a copy of the affidavit of service of process or acceptance of service with the national crime information center. The effectiveness of an injunction does not depend on the injunction's registration, and for enforcement purposes pursuant to section 13-2810, a copy of an injunction, whether or not registered, is presumed to be a valid existing order of the court for one year after the date on which the defendant was served. Any changes or modifications to the injunction are effective on entry by the court and shall be registered with the clerk of the issuing court, or as otherwise required by court rule, within twenty-four hours after the entry, excluding weekends and holidays.

M. This section does not:

1. Expand, diminish, alter or modify the duty of an employer to provide a safe workplace for its employees and other persons.

2. Permit a court to issue a temporary restraining order or injunction that prohibits speech or other activities that are constitutionally protected or otherwise protected by law, including actions involving organized labor disputes that do not involve unlawful picketing, trespassory assembly, unlawful mass assembly, concerted interference with lawful exercise of business activity and engaging in a secondary boycott as defined in section 23-1321, defamation in violation of section 23-1325 or any actual or threatened misrepresentation, fraud, duress, violence or breach of the peace.

3. Preclude either party from being represented by private counsel or appearing on the party's own behalf.

N. When the employer has knowledge that a specific person or persons are the target of harassment as defined by this section, the employer shall make a good faith effort to provide notice to the person or persons that the employer intends to petition the court for an injunction against workplace harassment.

O. Whether or not a violation occurs in the presence of a peace officer, a peace officer, with or without a warrant, may arrest a person if the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person has violated section 13-2810 by disobeying or resisting an injunction that was issued pursuant to this section.  The release provisions under section 13-3903 do not apply to an arrest made pursuant to this subsection.  A person who is arrested pursuant to this subsection may be released from custody pursuant to the Arizona rules of criminal procedure or any applicable statute.  The court shall include in an order for release any pretrial release conditions that the court deems appropriate.

P. The remedies under this section for the enforcement of protection orders are in addition to any other civil and criminal remedies that are available. The municipal court and the justice court may hear and decide all matters arising pursuant to this section.  On notice to the affected party and after a hearing, the court may enter an order that requires any party to pay the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney fees.  A party may appeal an order entered by a justice court or municipal court pursuant to section 22-261 or 22-425 and the superior court rules of civil appellate procedure without regard to an amount in controversy.

Q. A peace officer who makes an arrest pursuant to this section is immune from civil or criminal liability if the officer acts on probable cause.

R. An employer is immune from civil liability for seeking or failing to seek an injunction under this section unless the employer is seeking an injunction primarily to accomplish a purpose for which the injunction was not designed. Any action or statement by an employer under this section shall not be deemed an admission by the employer of any fact. An action or statement by an employer under this section may be used for impeachment purposes.

S. In addition to the persons who are authorized to serve process pursuant to rule 4(d), Arizona rules of civil procedure, a peace officer may serve an injunction against workplace harassment pursuant to this section.

You are hereby notified that your (property) may be taken away from you by (party seeking provisional remedy), who says that you owe (such party) a debt of $(amount).  (Party seeking provisional remedy), your creditor, wants to take your property so that (such party) can be sure you will pay if the court decides that you owe money to (party seeking provisional remedy).

## Chapter 16 - UNIFORM CONTRIBUTION AMONG TORTFEASORS ACT

### Article 1 - General Provisions

#### Section 12-2501. Right to contribution; definition

A. Except as otherwise provided in this article, if two or more persons become jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property or for the same wrongful death, there is a right of contribution among them even though judgment has not been recovered against all or any of them.

B. The right of contribution exists only in favor of a tortfeasor who has paid more than his pro rata share of the common liability, and his total recovery is limited to the amount paid by him in excess of his pro rata share. No tortfeasor is compelled to make contribution beyond his own pro rata share of the entire liability.

C. There is no right of contribution in favor of any tortfeasor who the trier of fact finds has intentionally, wilfully or wantonly caused or contributed to the injury or wrongful death.

D. A tortfeasor who enters into a settlement with a claimant is not entitled to recover contribution from another tortfeasor whose liability for the injury or wrongful death is not extinguished by the settlement nor in respect to any amount paid in a settlement which is in excess of what was reasonable.

E. A liability insurer, which by payment has discharged in full or in part the liability of a tortfeasor and has thereby discharged in full its obligation as insurer, is subrogated to the tortfeasor's right of contribution to the extent of the amount it has paid in excess of the tortfeasor's pro rata share of the common liability. This subsection does not limit or impair any right of subrogation arising from any other relationship.

F. This section and sections 12-2502, 12-2503, 12-2504, 12-2508 and 12-2509 do not:

1. Impair any right of indemnity under existing law. If one tortfeasor is entitled to indemnity from another, the right of the indemnity obligee is for indemnity and not contribution, and the indemnity obligor is not entitled to contribution from any obligee for any portion of his indemnity obligation.

2. Apply to breaches of trust or of other fiduciary obligation.

3. Create a right of contribution against an employer or other person who has paid or who is liable for workmen's compensation in connection with an injury or death pursuant to title 23, chapter 6, unless the employer or other person is subject to direct suit under section 23-1022. For purposes of determining the amount of pro rata shares under this article, any employer or other person who has paid or who is liable for workmen's compensation shall not be considered unless the employer or other person is subject to direct suit under section 23-1022.

G. As used in this article, "property damage" means both physical damage to tangible property and economic loss proximately caused by a breach of duty.

#### Section 12-2502. Pro rata shares

In determining the pro rata share of tortfeasors in the entire liability:

1. Their relative degrees of fault are the basis for allocation.

2. If equity requires, the collective liability of some as a group constitutes a single share.

3. Principles of equity applicable to contribution generally apply.

#### Section 12-2503. Enforcement

A. Whether or not judgment has been entered in an action against two or more tortfeasors for the same injury or wrongful death, contribution may be enforced by separate action.

B. If a judgment has been entered in an action against two or more tortfeasors for the same injury or wrongful death, contribution may be enforced in that action by judgment in favor of one against other judgment defendants by motion on notice to all parties to the action.

C. If there is a judgment for the injury or wrongful death against the tortfeasor seeking contribution, any separate action by him to enforce contribution must be commenced within one year after the judgment has become final by lapse of time for appeal or after appellate review.

D. If there is no judgment for the injury or wrongful death against the tortfeasor seeking contribution, his right of contribution is barred unless he has either:

1. Discharged by payment the common liability within the statute of limitations period applicable to the claimant's right of action against him and has commenced his action for contribution within one year after payment.

2. Agreed while action is pending against him to discharge the common liability and has within one year after the agreement paid the liability and commenced his action for contribution.

E. The recovery of a judgment for an injury or wrongful death against one tortfeasor does not of itself discharge the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless the judgment is satisfied. The satisfaction of the judgment does not impair a right of contribution.

F. The judgment of the court in determining the liability of the several defendants to the claimant for an injury or wrongful death is binding as among the defendants in determining their right to contribution. If the claimant's case is tried, the trier of fact shall apportion and determine the respective degrees of fault of the defendants to the action.

#### Section 12-2504. Release or covenant not to sue

If a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good faith to one of two or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death both of the following apply:

1. It does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide, but it reduces the claim against the others to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant or in the amount of the consideration paid for it, whichever is the greater.

2. It discharges the tortfeasor to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other tortfeasor.

#### Section 12-2505. Comparative negligence; definition

A. The defense of contributory negligence or of assumption of risk is in all cases a question of fact and shall at all times be left to the jury. If the jury applies either defense, the claimant's action is not barred, but the full damages shall be reduced in proportion to the relative degree of the claimant's fault which is a proximate cause of the injury or death, if any. There is no right to comparative negligence in favor of any claimant who has intentionally, wilfully or wantonly caused or contributed to the injury or wrongful death.

B. In this section, "claimant's fault" includes the fault imputed or attributed to a claimant by operation of law, if any.

#### Section 12-2506. Joint and several liability abolished; exception; apportionment of degrees of fault; definitions

A. In an action for personal injury, property damage or wrongful death, the liability of each defendant for damages is several only and is not joint, except as otherwise provided in this section. Each defendant is liable only for the amount of damages allocated to that defendant in direct proportion to that defendant's percentage of fault, and a separate judgment shall be entered against the defendant for that amount. To determine the amount of judgment to be entered against each defendant, the trier of fact shall multiply the total amount of damages recoverable by the plaintiff by the percentage of each defendant's fault, and that amount is the maximum recoverable against the defendant.

B. In assessing percentages of fault the trier of fact shall consider the fault of all persons who contributed to the alleged injury, death or damage to property, regardless of whether the person was, or could have been, named as a party to the suit. Negligence or fault of a nonparty may be considered if the plaintiff entered into a settlement agreement with the nonparty or if the defending party gives notice before trial, in accordance with requirements established by court rule, that a nonparty was wholly or partially at fault. Assessments of percentages of fault for nonparties are used only as a vehicle for accurately determining the fault of the named parties. Assessment of fault against nonparties does not subject any nonparty to liability in this or any other action, and it may not be introduced as evidence of liability in any action.

C. The relative degree of fault of the claimant, and the relative degrees of fault of all defendants and nonparties, shall be determined and apportioned as a whole at one time by the trier of fact. If two or more claimants have independent claims, a separate determination and apportionment of the relative degrees of fault of the respective parties, and any nonparties at fault, shall be made with respect to each of the independent claims.

D. The liability of each defendant is several only and is not joint, except that a party is responsible for the fault of another person, or for payment of the proportionate share of another person, if any of the following applies:

1. Both the party and the other person were acting in concert.

2. The other person was acting as an agent or servant of the party.

3. The party’s liability for the fault of another person arises out of a duty created by the federal employers' liability act, 45 United States Code

E. If a defendant is found jointly and severally liable pursuant to subsection D, the defendant has the right to contribution pursuant to this chapter.  In an action arising out of a duty created by the federal employers' liability act (45 United States Code section 51), a person or entity, other than an employee of the defendant, whose negligence or fault caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injury or death shall contribute to the defendant pursuant to this chapter.  An action for contribution shall be adjudicated and determined by the same trier of fact that adjudicates and determines the action for the plaintiff's injury or death.  The trier of fact shall adjudicate and determine an action for contribution after the court enters a judgment for the plaintiff's injury or death.  On motion before the conclusion of the trial, the plaintiff is entitled to an award against the defendant for actual expenses the plaintiff incurred as a direct result of the defendant's claim for contribution.  The expenses shall include reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.

F. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Acting in concert" means entering into a conscious agreement to pursue a common plan or design to commit an intentional tort and actively taking part in that intentional tort. Acting in concert does not apply to any person whose conduct was negligent in any of its degrees rather than intentional. A person's conduct that provides substantial assistance to one committing an intentional tort does not constitute acting in concert if the person has not consciously agreed with the other to commit the intentional tort.

2. "Fault" means an actionable breach of legal duty, act or omission proximately causing or contributing to injury or damages sustained by a person seeking recovery, including negligence in all of its degrees, contributory negligence, assumption of risk, strict liability, breach of express or implied warranty of a product, products liability and misuse, modification or abuse of a product.

 

 

#### Section 12-2507. Treatment of counterclaims and cross claims

A counterclaim or cross claim for injury to person or property or for wrongful death shall be treated as an independent claim for purposes of section 12-2506. A claim and counterclaim shall not be set off against each other except by agreement of both parties.

#### Section 12-2508. Redetermination of contribution shares

On motion made not later than one year after a judgment imposing joint and several liability and determining contribution rights is entered, the court shall determine whether all or part of a tortfeasor's contribution share under section 12-2502 is uncollectible from that tortfeasor. If a contribution share is totally or partially uncollectible, the court shall redetermine the contribution shares of the other tortfeasors so that the uncollectible contribution amount is paid, based on the ratio of the percentages of the contribution shares of the other tortfeasors. The court's order redetermining the contribution shares shall include a judgment for the uncollectible amount against the tortfeasor whose share is totally or partially uncollectible and in favor of the other tortfeasors.

#### Section 12-2509. Scope of contribution and comparative negligence

A. The right to contribution under sections 12-2501 through 12-2504 applies to all tortfeasors whose liability is based on negligence, strict liability in tort or any product liability action, as defined in section 12-681, including warranty.

B. If an action involves claims for relief alleging both negligence and strict liability in tort, and if section 12-2505 is applied with respect to the negligence claims for relief, the reduction in damages under section 12-2505 shall be applied to the damages awarded against all defendants, except that contributory negligence, as distinguished from assumption of risk, is not a defense to a claim alleging strict liability in tort, including any product liability action, as defined in section 12-681, except claims alleging negligence.

C. For purposes of section 12-2502, section 12-2503, subsection F and section 12-2505 with respect to cases involving assumption of risk, the relative degree of fault of a person strictly liable in tort is the defect causing injury to the claimant. Among two or more persons strictly liable in tort who are entitled to claim contribution against each other, the relative degree of fault of each is the degree to which each contributed to the defect causing injury to the claimant.

Before an arbitrator is appointed and is authorized and able to act, the court, on motion of a party to an arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, may enter an order for interim remedies to protect the effectiveness of the arbitration proceeding to the same extent and under the same conditions as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action.

D. If the arbitrator did not disclose a fact as required by subsection A or B of this section, on timely objection by a party, the court under section 12-3023, subsection A, paragraph 2 may vacate an award made by the arbitrator.

This subsection does not apply:

1. To the extent necessary to determine the claim of an arbitrator, arbitration organization or representative of the arbitration organization against a party to the arbitration proceeding.

2. To a hearing on a motion to vacate an award under section 12-3023, subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2 if the movant establishes prima facie that a ground for vacating the award exists.

E. If a person commences a civil action against an arbitrator, arbitration organization or representative of an arbitration organization arising from the services of the arbitrator, organization or representative or if a person seeks to compel an arbitrator or a representative of an arbitration organization to testify or produce records in violation of subsection D of this section, and the court decides that the arbitrator, arbitration organization or representative of an arbitration organization is immune from civil liability or that the arbitrator or representative of the organization is not competent to testify, the court shall award to the arbitrator, organization or representative reasonable attorney fees and other reasonable expenses of litigation.

B. An arbitrator may decide a request for summary disposition of a claim or particular issue either:

1. If all interested parties agree.

2. On request of one party to the arbitration proceeding if that party gives notice to all other parties to the proceeding and the other parties have a reasonable opportunity to respond.

C. If an arbitrator orders a hearing, the arbitrator shall set a time and place and give notice of the hearing at least five days before the hearing begins.  Unless a party to the arbitration proceeding makes an objection to lack or insufficiency of notice not later than the beginning of the hearing, the party's appearance at the hearing waives the objection.  On request of a party to the arbitration proceeding and for good cause shown, or on the arbitrator's own initiative, the arbitrator may adjourn the hearing from time to time as necessary but may not postpone the hearing to a time later than that fixed by the agreement to arbitrate for making the award unless the parties to the arbitration proceeding consent to a later date. The arbitrator may hear and decide the controversy on the evidence produced although a party who was duly notified of the arbitration proceeding did not appear.  The court, on request, may direct the arbitrator to conduct the hearing promptly and render a timely decision.

D. At a hearing under subsection C of this section, a party to the arbitration proceeding has a right to be heard, to present evidence material to the controversy and to cross-examine witnesses appearing at the hearing.

B. In order to make the proceedings fair, expeditious and cost effective, on request of a party to or a witness in an arbitration proceeding, an arbitrator may permit a deposition of any witness to be taken for use as evidence at the hearing, including a witness who cannot be subpoenaed for or is unable to attend a hearing.  The arbitrator shall determine the conditions under which the deposition is taken.

C. An arbitrator may permit such discovery as the arbitrator decides is appropriate in the circumstances, taking into account the needs of the parties to the arbitration proceeding and other affected persons and the desirability of making the proceeding fair, expeditious and cost effective.

D. If an arbitrator permits discovery under subsection C, the arbitrator may order a party to the arbitration proceeding to comply with the arbitrator's discovery related orders, issue subpoenas for the attendance of a witness and for the production of records and other evidence at a discovery proceeding and take action against a noncomplying party to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this state.

E. An arbitrator may issue a protective order to prevent the disclosure of privileged information, confidential information, trade secrets and other information protected from disclosure to the extent a court could if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this state.

F. All laws compelling a person under subpoena to testify and all fees for attending a judicial proceeding, a deposition or a discovery proceeding as a witness apply to an arbitration proceeding as if the controversy were the subject of a civil action in this state.

G. The court may enforce a subpoena or discovery related order for the attendance of a witness within this state and for the production of records and other evidence issued by an arbitrator in connection with an arbitration proceeding in another state on conditions determined by the court so as to make the arbitration proceeding fair, expeditious and cost effective.  A subpoena or discovery related order issued by an arbitrator in another state must be served in the manner provided by law for service of subpoenas in a civil action in this state and, on motion to the court by a party to the arbitration proceeding or the arbitrator, enforced in the manner provided by law for enforcement of subpoenas in a civil action in this state.

The court may extend or the parties to the arbitration proceeding may agree in a record to extend the time.  The court or the parties may do so within or after the time specified or ordered.  A party waives any objection that an award was not timely made unless the party gives notice of the objection to the arbitrator before receiving notice of the award.

 

#### Section 12-3020. Change of award by arbitrator

A. On motion to an arbitrator by a party to an arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator may modify or correct an award either:

C. As to all remedies other than those authorized by subsections A and B of this section, an arbitrator may order such remedies as the arbitrator considers just and appropriate under the circumstances of the arbitration proceeding.  The fact that such a remedy could not or would not be granted by the court is not a ground for refusing to confirm an award under section 12-3022 or for vacating an award under section 12-3023.

D. An arbitrator's expenses and fees, together with other expenses, must be paid as provided in the award.

E. If an arbitrator awards punitive damages or other exemplary relief under subsection A of this section, the arbitrator shall specify in the award the basis in fact justifying and the basis in law authorizing the award and state separately the amount of the punitive damages or other exemplary relief.
