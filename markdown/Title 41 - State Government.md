ARTICLE I

DECLARATION OF POLICY, PURPOSE AND INTENT

Whereas, every state enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this compact intends to ensure that their respective legislature's use of the power to originate a balanced budget amendment under article V of the Constitution of the United States will be exercised conveniently and with reasonable certainty as to the consequences thereof.

Now, therefore, in consideration of their expressed mutual promises and obligations, be it enacted by every state enacting, adopting and agreeing to be bound by this compact, and resolved by each of their respective legislatures, as the case may be, to exercise herewith all of their respective powers as set forth herein notwithstanding any law to the contrary.

ARTICLE II

DEFINITIONS

Section 1. "Compact" means this "compact for a balanced budget."

Section 2. "Convention" means the convention for proposing amendments organized by this compact under article V of the Constitution of the United States and, where contextually appropriate to ensure the terms of this compact are not evaded, any other similar gathering or body, which might be organized as a consequence of Congress receiving the application set out in this compact and claim authority to propose or effectuate any amendment, alteration or revision to the Constitution of the United States. This term does not encompass a convention for proposing amendments under article V of the Constitution of the United States that is organized independently of this compact based on the separate and distinct application of any state.

Section 3. "State" means one of the several states of the United States. Where contextually appropriate, the term "state" shall be construed to include all of its branches, departments, agencies, political subdivisions, and officers and representatives acting in their official capacity.

Section 4. "Member state" means a state that has enacted, adopted and agreed to be bound to this compact.  For any state to qualify as a member state with respect to any other state under this compact, each such state must have enacted, adopted and agreed to be bound by substantively identical compact legislation.

Section 5. "Compact notice recipients" means the archivist of the United States, the president of the United States, the president of the United States senate, the office of the secretary of the United States senate, the speaker of the United States house of representatives, the office of the clerk of the United States house of representatives, the chief executive officer of each state, and the presiding officer(s) of each house of the legislatures of the several states.

Section 6. Notice.  All notices required by this compact shall be by U.S. certified mail, return receipt requested, or an equivalent or superior form of notice, such as personal delivery documented by evidence of actual receipt.

Section 7. "Balanced budget amendment" means the following:

"Article __

Section 1. Total outlays of the government of the United States shall not exceed total receipts of the government of the United States at any point in time unless the excess of outlays over receipts is financed exclusively by debt issued in strict conformity with this article.

Section 2. Outstanding debt shall not exceed authorized debt, which initially shall be an amount equal to 105 percent of the outstanding debt on the effective date of this article.  Authorized debt shall not be increased above its aforesaid initial amount unless such increase is first approved by the legislatures of the several states as provided in

Section 3. From time to time, Congress may increase authorized debt to an amount in excess of its initial amount set by section 2 only if it first publicly refers to the legislatures of the several states an unconditional, single subject measure proposing the amount of such increase, in such form as provided by law, and the measure is thereafter publicly and unconditionally approved by a simple majority of the legislatures of the several states, in such form as provided respectively by state law; provided that no inducement requiring an expenditure or tax levy shall be demanded, offered or accepted as a quid pro quo for such approval.  If such approval is not obtained within sixty (60) calendar days after referral then the measure shall be deemed disapproved and the authorized debt shall thereby remain unchanged.

Section 4. Whenever the outstanding debt exceeds 98 percent of the debt limit set by section 2, the president shall enforce said limit by publicly designating specific expenditures for impoundment in an amount sufficient to ensure outstanding debt shall not exceed the authorized debt. Said impoundment shall become effective thirty (30) days thereafter, unless Congress first designates an alternate impoundment of the same or greater amount by concurrent resolution, which shall become immediately effective.  The failure of the President to designate or enforce the required impoundment is an impeachable misdemeanor.  Any purported issuance or incurrence of any debt in excess of the debt limit set by section 2 is void.

Section 5. No bill that provides for a new or increased general revenue tax shall become law unless approved by a two-thirds roll call vote of the whole number of each house of Congress.  However, this requirement shall not apply to any bill that provides for a new end user sales tax which would completely replace every existing income tax levied by the government of the United States; or for the reduction or elimination of an exemption, deduction, or credit allowed under an existing general revenue tax.

Section 6. For purposes of this article, "debt" means any obligation backed by the full faith and credit of the government of the United States; "outstanding debt" means all debt held in any account and by any entity at a given point in time; "authorized debt" means the maximum total amount of debt that may be lawfully issued and outstanding at any single point in time under this article; "total outlays of the government of the United States" means all expenditures of the government of the United States from any source; "total receipts of the government of the United States" means all tax receipts and other income of the government of the United States, excluding proceeds from its issuance or incurrence of debt or any type of liability; "impoundment" means a proposal not to spend all or part of a sum of money appropriated by Congress; and "general revenue tax" means any income tax, sales tax, or value-added tax levied by the government of the United States excluding imposts and duties.

Section 7. This article is immediately operative upon ratification, self-enforcing, and Congress may enact conforming legislation to facilitate enforcement."

ARTICLE III

(b) Notice of such state's member state status is or has been seasonably received by the compact administrator, if any, or otherwise by the chief executive officer of each other member state.

Section 3.

(b) Any difference in section 5 of article IV with specific regard to the respectively enacting state's own obligation to fund the commission;

(c) Any difference in sections 1 and 2 of article VI with specific regard to the number and identity of each delegate respectively appointed on behalf of the enacting state, provided that no more than three delegates may attend and participate in the convention on behalf of any state; or

However, whenever any member state enacts appropriate legislation, as determined by the laws of the respective state, withdrawing from this compact, the compact administrator shall immediately send certified conforming copies of the chaptered version of such withdrawal legislation as maintained in the statutes of each such withdrawing member state, solely to each chief executive officer of each remaining member state, giving notice of such withdrawal.

The limits may be adjusted pursuant to rules adopted by the department of administration.  Insurance and state self-insurance as prescribed in this section do not apply to providers who are contractually required to indemnify this state or a state department or agency for some or all of the liability of this state or a department or agency of this state. The insurance provided under this subsection does not include medical or workers' compensation coverage for providers.

The director of the department of administration may impose on the state department of corrections a deductible for each loss that arises out of a professional liability claim pursuant to this subsection.  Any changes in deductible amounts established by the director shall be subject to review by the joint legislative budget committee.

E. The department of administration may obtain property, liability, disability or workers' compensation insurance, self-insure or develop risk retention pools to provide for payment of property loss or casualty claims or disability insurance claims against contractors of this state with the approval of the joint legislative budget committee. With respect to insurance, self-insurance or risk retention pools for contractors licensed and contracted to do work for this state, the coverage afforded applies with respect to the conduct of the business entity of that contractor. The pool is available to all contractors regardless of the amount that the state-contracted work bears in relation to the amount of nonstate contracted work. The contractor shall be terminated from the pool if the contractor ceases to be a state contractor.

F. The department of administration may determine, in the best interests of this state, that state self-insurance is necessary or desirable and, if that decision is made, shall provide for state self-insurance for losses arising out of state property, liability or workers' compensation claims or for losses arising out of actual or suspected data breaches, security system breaches or security incidents prescribed by subsections A, C, D and E of this section.  If the department of administration provides state self-insurance as prescribed in this section, such coverage shall be excess over any other valid and collectible insurance, notwithstanding any other insurance clause provided in the policy of the other valid and collectible insurance. If state self-insurance and any other valid and collectible insurance are determined to be primary insurance, the department of administration and other insurers shall contribute equal amounts until the applicable limit of insurance has been paid or none of the loss remains, whichever occurs sooner. The director of the department of administration may impose on state departments, agencies, boards and commissions a deductible for each loss that arises out of a property, liability or workers' compensation claim, actual or suspected data breach, security system breach or security incident pursuant to this subsection. Any changes in deductible amounts established by the director shall be subject to review by the joint legislative budget committee.

H. A successful bidder for risk management services pursuant to this section is not entitled to receive directly or indirectly any sales commission, contingent commission, excess profit commission, or other commissions, or anything of value, as payment for the risk management services except those amounts received directly from this state as payment for the risk management services.

A state officer, agent or employee acting in good faith, without wanton disregard of statutory duties and under the authority of an enactment that is subsequently declared to be unconstitutional, invalid or inapplicable, is not personally liable for an injury or damage caused thereby except to the extent that the officer, agent or employee would have been personally liable had the enactment been constitutional, valid and applicable.

K. A state officer, agent or employee, except as otherwise provided by statute, is not personally liable for an injury or damage resulting from an act or omission in a public official capacity where the act or omission was the result of the exercise of the discretion vested in the officer, agent or employee and if the exercise of the discretion was done in good faith without wanton disregard of statutory duties.

L. This state and its departments, agencies, boards and commissions are immune from liability for losses arising out of a judgment for wilful and wanton conduct resulting in punitive or exemplary damages.

M. The following exclusions shall apply to subsections A, B and F of this section:

If it is in the best interest of this state, the joint legislative budget committee may establish higher settlement limits. Any settlements involving amounts in excess of $250,000 or such higher limit as may be established by the joint legislative budget committee shall be approved by the department of administration, the attorney general and the joint legislative budget committee pursuant to the authority granted.  The settlement of liability claims shall be solely the authority of the department of administration, the attorney general and the joint legislative budget committee.  No state department, agency, board or commission or any officer, agent or employee of this state may voluntarily make any payment, assume any obligation, incur any expense or maintain the individual right of consent for liability claims made pursuant to this chapter except as provided by this section.

The department may include in its annual budget request, pursuant to section 41-622, subsection D, the cost of the insurance purchased or provided.  In connection with the construction of public works projects, the department of administration may also use an owner-controlled or wrap-up insurance program if all of the following conditions are met:

B. The risk management revolving fund in the department of administration shall exclude any property loss arising from damage due to mechanical or electrical breakdown, ordinary wear and tear or obsolescence, nonserviceability, mysterious disappearance or inventory shortage.  Mysterious disappearance does not include a loss if there is a reasonable presumption of theft. The department of administration, subject to chapter 23 of this title, may advance or disburse monies to contractors who rebuild state property as a result of self-insured losses or to persons who supply goods or services in replacing self-insured losses. The department of administration shall pay for claims processing costs, including adjusting costs, legal defense costs and attorney fees, for any portion of claims falling within state self-insurance coverage pursuant to this chapter.

C. To qualify for payment for loss by theft or burglary of state-owned personal property, an agency, department, board or commission must show evidence of forcible entry or that threat of violence was used in the taking of the property or there must be a reasonable presumption of theft.

D.

The budget request shall be broken down to reflect the amount of monies to be charged to each of the state departments, agencies, boards and commissions and any others insured under this chapter. Any state department, agency, board or commission that has an amount for insurance included in its appropriation, whether specifically stated or not, and any state department, agency, board or commission or others insured under this chapter that receive funds other than those appropriated shall be billed for the proportionate share of the charges for insurance or self-insurance by the department of administration. In collecting the agency billings for risk management charges, the director of the department of administration may transfer the entire amount of the billing for appropriated insurance from the agency account into the fund designated in subsection A of this section at the start of the fiscal year or in periodic payments during the fiscal year if necessitated by cash flow restrictions. Those entities or persons insured under this chapter that are not state agencies, departments, boards, commissions or employees or that do not receive funding from state sources shall pay annually the amount required by risk management to the risk management revolving fund or construction insurance fund before the coverage continues for existing claims or begins for new claims made.

E. All monies recovered by the state pursuant to litigation, recovery, salvage value of damaged property, proportionate share monies from any other existing state funds, or otherwise, for damages relating to either a liability, property or workers' compensation loss for which monies from the risk management revolving fund or construction insurance fund have been or will be paid shall be deposited in the respective fund.

If the appeal is lost by this state, the judgment amount plus interest at the rate prescribed in this subsection shall be paid.

G. All monies deposited in the risk management revolving fund and the cyber risk insurance fund are subject to annual legislative appropriation to the department of administration for use pursuant to this section. Monies in the construction insurance fund are continuously appropriated for the fund purposes. The funds established by subsection A of this section are exempt from the provisions of section 35-190 relating to lapsing of appropriations.

H. A $10,000 death benefit shall be paid from the risk management revolving fund to the estate of a deceased volunteer, who is registered as a volunteer by the agency, board or commission, or to an employee who is not subject to section 38-651.02, on proof of death while in the course and scope of duties as prescribed in section 41-621, subsection Q for any state agency, board or commission.

B. An agency may also include as part of the report the text of a proposed expedited rule pursuant to section 41-1027.

C. The council shall schedule the periodic review of each agency's rules and shall approve or return, in whole or in part, the agency's report on its review.  The council may grant an agency an extension from filing an agency's report.  If the council returns an agency's report, in whole or in part, the council shall inform the agency of the manner in which its report is inadequate and, in consultation with the agency, shall schedule submission of a revised report.

D. The council may review rules outside of the five-year review process if requested by at least four council members.

E.

1. Identifies the reason for the extension request.

2. Demonstrates good cause for the extension.

G. The agency shall notify the council of an amendment or repeal of a rule for which the council has set an expiration date under subsection E of this section.  If the agency does not amend or repeal the rule by the date specified by the council under subsection E of this section or the extended date under subsection F of this section, the rule automatically expires.  The council shall file a notice of rule expiration with the secretary of state and notify the agency of the expiration of the rule.

The timely filing for an extension permits the agency to submit its report on or before the date prescribed by the council.

B. If an agency determines that an application for a license is not administratively complete, the agency shall include a comprehensive list of the specific deficiencies in the written notice provided pursuant to subsection A of this section.

C.

D.

The agency and applicant may mutually agree in writing to allow the agency to submit supplemental requests for additional information.

B. By mutual written agreement, an agency and an applicant for a license may extend the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame. An extension of the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame may not exceed twenty-five per cent of the overall time frame.

#### Section 41-1076. Compliance with overall time frame

Unless an agency and an applicant for a license mutually agree to extend the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame pursuant to section 41-1075, an agency shall issue a written notice granting or denying a license within the overall time frame to an applicant. If an agency denies an application for a license, the agency shall include in the written notice at least the following information:

1. Justification for the denial with references to the statutes or rules on which the denial is based.

2. An explanation of the applicant's right to appeal the denial. The explanation shall include the number of days in which the applicant must file a protest challenging the denial and the name and telephone number of an agency contact person who can answer questions regarding the appeals process.

The agency shall not require an applicant to submit an application for a refund pursuant to this subsection. The refund shall be made within thirty days after the expiration of the overall time frame or the time frame extension.  The agency shall continue to process the application subject to subsection B of this section.  Notwithstanding any other statute, the agency shall make the refund from the fund in which the application fees were originally deposited.  This section applies only to license applications that were subject to substantive review.

B. Except for license applications that were not subject to substantive review, the agency shall pay a penalty to the state general fund for each month after the expiration of the overall time frame or the time frame extension until the agency issues written notice to the applicant granting or denying the license.  The agency shall pay the penalty from the agency fund in which the application fees were originally deposited. The penalty shall be two and one-half per cent of the total fees received by the agency for reviewing and acting on the application for each license that the agency has not granted or denied on the last day of each month after the expiration of the overall time frame or time frame extension for that license.

If an informal settlement conference is requested, the agency shall notify the office of the request and the outcome of the conference, except as provided in section 41-1092.01, subsection F.

The administrative law judge may administer oaths and affirmations to witnesses.

D. All parties shall have the opportunity to respond and present evidence and argument on all relevant issues. All relevant evidence is admissible, but the administrative law judge may exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, by confusion of the issues or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. The administrative law judge shall exercise reasonable control over the manner and order of cross-examining witnesses and presenting evidence to make the cross-examination and presentation effective for ascertaining the truth, avoiding needless consumption of time and protecting witnesses from harassment or undue embarrassment.

E. All hearings shall be recorded. The administrative law judge shall secure either a court reporter or an electronic means of producing a clear and accurate record of the proceeding at the agency's expense. Any party that requests a transcript of the proceeding shall pay the costs of the transcript to the court reporter or other transcriber.

F. Unless otherwise provided by law, the following apply:

1. A hearing may be conducted in an informal manner and without adherence to the rules of evidence required in judicial proceedings.  Neither the manner of conducting the hearing nor the failure to adhere to the rules of evidence required in judicial proceedings is grounds for reversing any administrative decision or order if the evidence supporting the decision or order is substantial, reliable and probative.

2. Copies of documentary evidence may be received in the discretion of the administrative law judge. On request, the parties shall be given an opportunity to compare the copy with the original.

3. Notice may be taken of judicially cognizable facts. In addition, notice may be taken of generally recognized technical or scientific facts within the agency's specialized knowledge. The parties shall be notified either before or during the hearing or by reference in preliminary reports or otherwise of the material noticed including any staff memoranda or data and they shall be afforded an opportunity to contest the material so noticed. The agency's experience, technical competence and specialized knowledge may be used in the evaluation of the evidence.  An agency-issued license that substantially complied with the applicable licensing requirements establishes a prima facie demonstration that the license meets all state and federal legal and technical requirements and the license would protect public health, welfare and the environment. An adversely affected party may rebut a prima facie demonstration by presenting clear and convincing evidence demonstrating that one or more provisions in the license violate a specifically applicable state or federal requirement. If an adversely affected party rebuts a prima facie demonstration, the applicant or licensee and the agency director may present additional evidence to support issuing the license.

4. On application of a party or the agency and for use as evidence, the administrative law judge may permit a deposition to be taken, in the manner and on the terms designated by the administrative law judge, of a witness who cannot be subpoenaed or who is unable to attend the hearing.  The administrative law judge may order subpoenas for the production of documents if the party seeking the discovery demonstrates that the party has reasonable need of the materials being sought. All provisions of law compelling a person under subpoena to testify are applicable. Fees for attendance as a witness shall be the same as for a witness in court, unless otherwise provided by law or agency rule. Notwithstanding section 12-2212, subpoenas, depositions or other discovery shall not be permitted except as provided by this paragraph or subsection C of this section.

5. Informal disposition may be made by stipulation, agreed settlement, consent order or default.

6. Findings of fact shall be based exclusively on the evidence and on matters officially noticed.

7. A final administrative decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated. Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings. Conclusions of law shall specifically address the agency's authority to make the decision consistent with section 41-1030.

G. Except as otherwise provided by law:

1. At a hearing on an agency's denial of a license or permit or a denial of an application or request for modification of a license or permit, the applicant has the burden of persuasion.

2. At a hearing on an agency action to suspend, revoke, terminate or modify on its own initiative material conditions of a license or permit, the agency has the burden of persuasion.

3. At a hearing on an agency's imposition of fees or penalties or any agency compliance order, the agency has the burden of persuasion.

4. At a hearing held pursuant to chapter 23 or 24 of this title, the appellant or claimant has the burden of persuasion.

H. Subsection G of this section does not affect the law governing burden of persuasion in an agency denial of, or refusal to issue, a license renewal.

2. The decision of the agency head is subject to review pursuant to subsection C of this section.

3. The licensee accepts the administrative law judge's decision concerning the appeal of a licensing decision as final pursuant to subsection I of this section.

G. If a board or commission whose members are appointed by the governor makes the final administrative decision as an administrative law judge or on review of the decision of the agency head, the decision is not subject to review by the head of the agency.

The court shall determine the matter under the standards applicable for granting preliminary injunctions.

I. Except for a licensing decision concerning the administrative completeness of an application submitted by a licensee or a licensing decision where the agency, executive director, board or commission has determined that the licensee poses a threat of grave harm or danger to the public or has acted with complete disregard for the well-being of the public in engaging or in being allowed to engage in the licensee's regulated business activity, for any appealable agency action or contested case involving a licensing decision, the licensee may accept the decision not more than ten days after receiving the administrative law judge's written decision.

A. A person may not refuse to attend and testify or produce evidence sought by an agency in an action, proceeding or investigation instituted by or before the agency on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise, required of the person may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture unless it constitutes the compelled testimony or the private papers of the person that would be privileged evidence either pursuant to the fifth amendment of the Constitution of the United States or article II, section 10, Constitution of Arizona, and the person claims the privilege before the production of the testimony or papers.

B. If a person asserts the privilege against self-incrimination and the agency seeks to compel production of the testimony or documents sought, the office or agency as provided in section 41-1092.01, subsection F may issue, with the prior written approval of the attorney general, a written order compelling the testimony or production of documents in proceedings and investigations before the office or agency as provided in section 41-1092.01, subsection F or apply to the appropriate court for such an order in other actions or proceedings.

D. Notwithstanding any other law or rule, the agency may determine that the person's criminal record disqualifies the person from obtaining a license, permit, certificate or other state recognition only if the agency concludes that the state has an important interest in protecting public safety that is superior to the person's right and either of the following applies:

1. The person was convicted of any of the following, the conviction occurred within seven years before the date of the petition, excluding any period of time that the person was imprisoned in the custody of the state department of corrections, and the conviction has not been set aside:

1. The specific offense that the person was convicted of substantially relates to the state's interest and specifically and directly relates to the duties and responsibilities of the occupation, except offenses involving moral turpitude.

2. The person, based on the nature of the specific offense that the person was convicted of and the person's current circumstances, including the passage of time since the person committed the crime and any evidence of rehabilitation or treatment, is more likely to reoffend by virtue of having the license, permit, certificate or other state recognition than if the person did not have the license, permit, certificate or other state recognition.

1. Is not authorized by statute.

2. Is inconsistent with other statutes, rules or agency enforcement policies and the inconsistency results in a significant burden on the regulated public.

B. If, upon investigation, the division determines that no unlawful discriminatory practice or act has occurred, the division shall notify the charging party and the respondent in writing of this fact and the charging party may within thirty days thereafter file a complaint with the superior court in the county where the alleged discriminatory practice or act occurred.

E. If the division concludes at any time after the filing of a charge that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of article 2 or 3 of this chapter, the division may file a civil action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the charge.  Any temporary restraining order or other order granting preliminary or temporary relief shall be issued in accordance with the supreme court rules of civil procedure.

### Article 6 - Enforcement Procedures for Discrimination in Employment

#### Section 41-1481. Filing charges; investigation; findings; conciliation; compliance proceedings; appeals; attorney fees; violation; classification

A. A charge under this section shall be filed within one hundred eighty days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred. A charge is deemed filed on receipt by the division from or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved or, if filed by a member of the division, when executed by the member on oath or affirmation. A charge is deemed filed by or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved if received from the United States equal employment opportunity commission. A charge shall be in writing on oath or affirmation and shall contain the information, including the date, place and circumstances of the alleged unlawful employment practice, and be in the form as the division requires. The division shall not make charges public.

B. Whenever a charge is filed by or on behalf of a person claiming to be aggrieved or by a member of the division, referred to as the charging party, alleging that an employer, employment agency, labor organization or joint labor-management committee controlling apprenticeship or other training or retraining programs, including on-the-job training programs, has engaged in an unlawful employment practice, the division shall serve notice of and a copy of the charge on the employer, employment agency, labor organization or joint labor-management committee, referred to as the respondent, within ten days and shall investigate the charge. If the division determines after the investigation that there is not reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, the division shall enter an order determining the same and dismissing the charge and shall notify the charging party and the respondent of its action. If the division determines after the investigation that there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true, the division shall enter an order containing its findings of fact and shall endeavor to eliminate the alleged unlawful employment practice by informal methods of conference, conciliation and persuasion. Any party to the informal proceeding may be represented by counsel. Counsel need not be a member of the state bar if counsel is licensed to practice law in any other state or territory of the United States. Nothing said or done during and as a part of the informal endeavors may be made public by the division or its officers or employees or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding without the written consent of the persons concerned. If a civil action resulting from a charge is commenced in any federal or state court, evidence collected by or submitted to the division during the investigation of the charge and the source of the evidence shall be subject to discovery by the parties to the civil action. Any person who makes public information in violation of this subsection is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor. The division shall make its determination on reasonable cause as promptly as possible and as far as practicable not later than sixty days from the filing of the charge. If more than two years have elapsed after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred, and if the charging party has received a notice of right to sue, the division may cease investigation of a charge without reaching a determination.

C. All conciliation agreements shall provide that the charging party waives, releases and covenants not to sue the respondent or claim against the respondent in any forum with respect to the matters which were alleged as charges filed with the division, subject to performance by the respondent of the promises and representations contained in the conciliation agreement.  The charging party or the respondent may prepare a conciliation agreement that the division shall submit to the other party and that, if accepted by the other party, shall be accepted by the division.

D. If within thirty days after the division has made a determination that reasonable cause exists to believe that the charge is true the division has not accepted a conciliation agreement to which the charging party and the respondent are parties, the division may bring a civil action against the respondent, other than the state, named in the charge. The charging party shall have the right to intervene in a civil action brought by the division. If a charge filed with the division pursuant to subsection A of this section is dismissed by the division or if within ninety days from the filing of such charge the division has not filed a civil action under this section or has not entered into a conciliation agreement with the charging party, the division shall so notify the charging party. After providing the notice a civil action may be brought against the respondent named in the charge by the charging party or, if that charge was filed by a member of the division, by any person whom the charge alleges was aggrieved by the alleged unlawful employment practice. In no event shall any action be brought pursuant to this article more than one year after the charge to which the action relates has been filed. On application by the complainant and in the circumstances as the court may deem just, the court may appoint an attorney for such complainant and may authorize the commencement of the action without the payment of fees, costs or security. On timely application, the court may in its discretion allow the division to intervene in civil actions in which the state is not a defendant on certification that the case is of general public importance. Upon request the court may stay further proceedings for not more than sixty days pending the further efforts of the parties or the division to obtain voluntary compliance.

E. Whenever a charge is filed with the division and the division concludes on the basis of a preliminary investigation that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this article or article 4 of this chapter, the division may bring an action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the charge. Any temporary restraining order or other order granting preliminary or temporary relief shall be issued in accordance with the Arizona rules of civil procedure. The court having jurisdiction over the proceedings shall assign such action for hearing at the earliest practicable date and cause the action to be expedited in every way.

F. The court shall assign any action brought under this article for hearing at the earliest practicable date and cause the action to be in every way expedited. If the action has not been scheduled for trial within one hundred twenty days after issue has been joined, the judge may appoint a master pursuant to rule 53 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure.

G. If the court finds that the defendant has intentionally engaged in or is intentionally engaging in an unlawful employment practice alleged in the complaint, the court may enjoin the defendant from engaging in the unlawful employment practice and order the affirmative action as may be appropriate. Affirmative action may include, but is not limited to, reinstatement or hiring of employees with or without back pay payable by the employer, employment agency or labor organization responsible for the unlawful employment practice or any other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate. Back pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years before the filing of the charge with the division. Interim earnings or amounts earnable with reasonable diligence by the person or persons discriminated against shall reduce the back pay otherwise allowable. An order of the court shall not require the admission or reinstatement of an individual as a member of a union or the hiring, reinstatement or promotion of an individual as an employee or the payment to the individual of any back pay if the individual was refused admission, suspended or expelled or was refused employment or advancement or was suspended or discharged for any reason other than discrimination on account of race, color, religion, sex, age, disability or national origin or a violation of section 41-1464.

H. In any case in which an employer, employment agency or labor organization fails to comply with an order of a court issued in a civil action brought under this section, a party to the action or the division on the written request of a person aggrieved by such failure may commence proceedings to compel compliance with the order.

I. Any civil action brought under this section and any proceedings brought under subsection H of this section are subject to appeal as provided in sections 12-120.21, 12-120.22 and 12-120.24.

J. In any action or proceeding under this section the court may allow the prevailing party, other than the division, a reasonable  attorney fee as part of the costs.

#### Section 41-1482. Recordkeeping; preservation of records; reports to division; furnishing information to other governmental agencies; information confidential; classification

A. Every employer, employment agency and labor organization subject to article 4 of this chapter shall make and keep such records relevant to the determination of whether unlawful employment practices have been or are being committed, preserve such records for such periods and make such reports therefrom as the division shall prescribe by regulation or order, after public hearing, as reasonable, necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of this article and article 4. Compliance with reporting and recordkeeping regulations issued by the United States equal employment opportunity commission shall be compliance with this subsection. Any employer, employment agency, labor organization or joint labor-management committee which believes that the application to it of any regulation or order issued under this section would result in undue hardship may apply to the division for an exemption. If an application for such exemption is denied, a civil action may be brought in the superior court for the county where such records are kept. If the division of the court, as the case may be, finds that the application of the regulation or order to the employer, employment agency or labor organization in question, or in general, would impose an undue hardship, the division or the court, as the case may be, may grant appropriate relief. If any person required to comply with the provisions of this subsection fails or refuses to do so, the superior court for the county in which such person is found, resides or transacts business shall upon application of the division issue to such person an order requiring him to comply.

B. In prescribing requirements pursuant to subsection A, the division shall consult with other interested governmental agencies and shall coordinate its requirements with those adopted by such agencies. Upon request the division may furnish to any such governmental agency charged with the administration of a fair employment practices law information obtained pursuant to subsection A from any employer, employment agency, labor organization or joint labor-management committee subject to the jurisdiction of such agency. Such information shall be furnished on condition that it not be made public by the recipient agency prior to the institution of a proceeding under applicable law involving such information. If this condition is violated by a recipient agency, the division may decline to honor subsequent requests of such agency.

C. It is unlawful for any officer or employee of the division or the board to make public in any manner whatever any information obtained by the division pursuant to its authority under this section prior to the institution of any proceeding involving such information under this article. Any officer, employee or agent of the division or the board who shall make public in any manner whatever any information in violation of this subsection is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.

#### Section 41-1483. Notices to be posted; violation; classification

A. Every employer, employment agency and labor organization shall post and keep posted in conspicuous places upon its premises where notices to employees, applicants for employment and members are customarily posted a notice to be prepared or approved by the division setting forth excerpts from or summaries of the pertinent provisions of this article and article 4 and information pertinent to the filing of a complaint.

B. Intentional failure to post such notices after having been furnished such notices by the division is a petty offense.

#### Section 41-1484. Rules and regulations; good faith compliance as defense in agency and court proceedings

In any action or proceeding based on an alleged unlawful employment practice, no person shall be subject to liability or punishment for or on account of the commission by such person of an unlawful employment practice if he pleads and proves that the act or omission complained of was in good faith, in conformity with and in reasonable reliance on any interpretation or opinion of the division or the failure of such person to publish or file any information required by any provision of this article if he pleads and proves that he failed to publish or file such information in good faith, in conformity with and in reasonable reliance on any instructions of the division regarding the publishing or filing of such information. Either defense, if established, shall be a bar to the action or proceeding, notwithstanding that after such act or omission, such interpretation or opinion is modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority to be invalid or of no legal effect or after failing to publish or file pursuant to the instructions of the division such instructions are determined by judicial authority not to be in conformity with the requirements of this article.

1. The applicant makes new capital investment in this state after June 30, 2012 in a qualified facility that is completed in a taxable year beginning from and after December 31, 2012.

2. At least fifty-one percent of the net new full-time employment positions with job duties associated with the qualified facility pay a wage that equals or exceeds one hundred twenty-five percent, or one hundred percent in the case of a qualified facility in a rural location, of the median annual wage for production occupations in this state, as determined by the most recent annual Arizona commerce authority occupational wage and employment estimates issued before the preapproval is issued pursuant to subsection I of this section.

3. All net new full-time employment positions include health insurance coverage for the employees for which the applicant pays at least sixty-five percent of the premium or membership cost.

2. The availability of income tax credit capacity under the dollar limit prescribed by subsection J of this section.

I. Within thirty days after receiving a complete and correct application, the authority shall review the application to determine whether the applicant satisfies all of the criteria prescribed by this section and either preapprove the project as qualifying for the purposes of an income tax credit or provide reasons for its denial.  The authority shall send copies of each preapproval to the department of revenue.

J. The authority shall not preapprove income tax credits under this section that combined would exceed $125,000,000 in any calendar year, except as provided by this subsection and subsection K of this section. A preapproved amount applies against the dollar limit for the year in which the application was submitted regardless of whether the initial preapproval period extends into the following year or years.  The authority shall not preapprove income tax credits under this section for any taxpayer in excess of $30,000,000 in any calendar year.

K. The authority shall reallocate the amount of income tax credits that are voluntarily relinquished under subsection L of this section, that lapse under subsection M of this section or that lapse under subsection P of this section. The reallocation shall be to other businesses that applied under this section in the original credit year based on priority placement. Once reallocated, the amount of the credit applies against the dollar limit of the original credit year regardless of the year in which the reallocation occurs.

L. A taxpayer may voluntarily relinquish unused credit amounts in writing to the authority.

M. Preapproval under this section lapses, the application is void and the amount of the preapproved income tax credits does not apply against the dollar limit prescribed by subsection J of this section if, within twelve months after preapproval, the business fails to provide to the authority documentation of its expenditure of $250,000 in qualifying investment or, if the period over which the qualifying investment will be made exceeds twelve months, documentation of additional expenditures as required in this subsection for each twelve-month period.

N. After October 31 of each year, if the authority has preapproved the maximum calendar year income tax credit amount pursuant to subsection J of this section, the authority may accept initial applications for the next calendar year, but the preapproval of any application pursuant to this subsection shall not be effective before the first business day of the following calendar year.

O. Before an applicant applies for postapproval under subsection P of this section, the applicant must enter into a written managed review agreement with the chief executive officer of the authority that establishes the requirements of a managed review to be conducted under this subsection at the applicant's expense. The managed review must be conducted by a certified public accountant who is selected by the applicant, who is licensed in this state or who has a limited reciprocity privilege pursuant to section 32-725 and who is approved by the chief executive officer. The certified public accountant and the firm the certified public accountant is affiliated with shall not regularly perform services for the applicant or its affiliates. The managed review shall include an analysis of the applicant's invoices, checks, accounting records and other documents and information to verify its base investment and other requirements prescribed by section 43-1083.03 or 43-1164.04 to confirm the amount of credit. The certified public accountant shall furnish written findings of the managed review to the chief executive officer. The chief executive officer shall review the findings and may examine records and perform other reviews that the chief executive officer considers necessary to verify that the managed review substantially conforms to the terms of the managed review agreement. The chief executive officer shall accept or reject the findings of the managed review. If the chief executive officer rejects all or part of the managed review, the chief executive officer shall provide written reasons for the rejection.

P. When the qualified facility begins operations, a business that was preapproved for income tax credits under this section shall apply to the authority in writing for postapproval of the credits and submit documentation certifying the total amount and dates of the qualifying investments and identifying the fixed capital assets associated with the qualified facility incurred after June 30, 2012 through the date of application for postapproval. For taxable years beginning from and after December 31, 2012, the authority shall provide postapproval to a business that has met the eligibility requirements of this section and shall notify the department of revenue that the business may claim an income tax credit pursuant to section 43-1083.03 or 43-1164.04. If the amount of qualifying investment actually spent is less than the amount preapproved for income tax credits, the preapproved amount not incurred lapses and does not apply against the dollar limit prescribed by subsection J of this section for that year. The department of revenue shall not allow an income tax credit under section 43-1083.03 or 43-1164.04 that exceeds the amount of the postapproval for the project under this subsection. For the purposes of this subsection, "begins operations" means the qualified facility opens for public business.

Q. The authority may rescind an applicant's postapproval if the business no longer meets the terms and conditions required for qualifying for the credit. The authority may give special consideration, or allow temporary exemption from recapture of the credit, in the case of extraordinary hardship due to factors beyond the control of the qualifying business.

R. If the authority rescinds an applicant's preapproval or postapproval under subsection Q of this section, the authority shall notify the department of revenue of the action and the conditions of noncompliance. If the department of revenue obtains information indicating a possible failure to qualify and comply, the department shall provide that information to the authority. The department of revenue may require the business to file appropriate amended tax returns reflecting any recapture of the credit under section 43-1083.03 or 43-1164.04.

S. Preapproval and postapproval of an applicant for the purposes of income tax credits under this section do not constitute or imply compliance with any other provision of law or any regulatory rule, order, procedure, permit or other measure required by law. To maintain qualification for a credit under this section, a business must separately comply with all environmental, employment and other regulatory measures.

T. For five years after postapproval of an income tax credit under this section, in any action involving the liquidation of the business assets or relocation out of state, this state claims the position of a secured creditor of the business in the amount of the credit the business received pursuant to section 43-1083.03 or 43-1164.04. The transfer of part or all of a company's assets that are then leased back by the company is not considered a liquidation under this section.

U. Any information gathered from a business for the purposes of this section is considered to be confidential taxpayer information and shall be disclosed only as provided in section 42-2003, subsection B, paragraph 12, except that the authority shall publish the following information in its annual report:

1. The name of each business and the amount of income tax credits preapproved for each qualifying investment.

2. The amount of income tax credits postapproved with respect to each qualifying investment.

V. The authority shall:

1. Keep annual records of the information provided on applications for qualified facilities. These records shall reflect a percentage comparison of the annual amount of monies credited to qualified facilities to the estimated amount of monies spent in this state in the form of qualifying investments.

2. Maintain annual data on growth in this state of qualified facilities and related employment and wages.

3. Not later than April 30 following each calendar year, prepare and publish a report summarizing the information collected pursuant to this subsection.  The authority shall make copies of the annual report available to the public on request.

W. The authority shall adopt rules and prescribe forms and procedures as necessary for the purposes of this section.

If a qualified small business fails to maintain the qualifications, the business shall notify the authority within five business days after failing to meet the qualifications. The authority shall revoke the certification of the business and may assess a penalty against the business entity equal to the amount of the tax credits authorized after the business failed to meet the qualifications. The penalty shall be deposited in the state general fund. If the certification is revoked or expires, subsequent investments in the business do not qualify for a tax credit pursuant to this section and section 43-1074.02. All tax credits that are issued before any expiration or revocation of the certification shall remain valid.  Any application for a tax credit shall not be denied on the basis of the expiration or revocation of the certification if the investment was made before the date of the expiration or revocation.

If the computer data center is to qualify under subsection E, paragraph 2 of this section, an affirmation, signed by an authorized executive representing the owner or operator, that the computer data center has satisfied the certification requirements prescribed in subsection E, paragraph 2 of this section, whether the computer data center qualifies as a sustainable redevelopment project and that the computer data center will not violate subsection M of this section.

C. Within sixty days after receiving a complete and correct application, the authority shall review the application and either issue a written certification that the computer data center qualifies for the tax relief or provide written reasons for its denial.  Failure to approve or deny the application within sixty days after the date the owner or operator submits the application to the authority constitutes approval of the computer data center, and the authority shall issue written certification to the owner or operator within fourteen days. The effective date of the certification is either the date on which the application was submitted to the authority or a prospective date stated in the application that does not exceed five years after the date on which the application was submitted. The authority shall send a copy of the certification, including its effective date, to the department of revenue. The authority shall not certify any new computer data center that submits an application to the authority after December 31, 2033.

D. An owner or operator may separate a facility into one or more computer data centers, which may each receive a separate certification if each computer data center individually meets the requirements prescribed in subsection E of this section.  A portion of a facility or an article of computer data center equipment shall not be deemed to be a part of more than one computer data center.  The owner or operator may aggregate one or more of the parcels, buildings, condominiums or modular data centers in a facility into a single computer data center if, in the aggregate, the parcels, buildings, condominiums and modular data centers meet the requirements of subsection E of this section.

2. During the seventy-two months immediately before September 1, 2013, the computer data center created an investment of at least $250,000,000, including costs of land, buildings, improvements, modular data centers and computer data center equipment, whether owned or leased or paid for pursuant to a right to use agreement.

F. On or before the fifth anniversary of the certification of a new computer data center, the owner or operator shall notify the authority in writing that the computer data center for which the certification is requested has or has not satisfied the requirements prescribed in subsection E, paragraph 1 of this section. Until a new computer data center satisfies the requirements prescribed in subsection E, paragraph 1 of this section, the owner or operator shall keep detailed records of all investment created by the new computer data center, including costs of land, buildings, improvements, modular data centers and computer data center equipment, and all tax relief directly received by the owner or operator. This subsection does not apply to an existing computer data center.

G. If the authority determines that:

1. A new computer data center that is certified under subsection E, paragraph 1 of this section has not complied with the requirements and time periods prescribed by subsection E, paragraph 1 of this section, the authority shall revoke the computer data center's certification. If the certification is revoked, the qualification period of any owner, operator or qualified colocation tenant of the computer data center automatically terminates, and the department of revenue may recapture all or part of the tax relief provided directly to the owners and operators.  A qualified colocation tenant is not subject to recapture of any part of tax relief received pursuant to this section, except that a contributing qualified colocation tenant may be subject to recapture if it is located in a computer data center that is certified from and after August 31, 2016.  An owner or operator may appeal any revocation under this paragraph pursuant to chapter 6, article 10 of this title.

2. There has been a violation of subsection M of this section with respect to a computer data center:

(a) The authority shall revoke the computer data center's certification and, if revoked, the qualification period of any owner, operator or qualified colocation tenant of the computer data center automatically terminates.

(b) The department of revenue may not recapture any tax relief provided directly to the owner, operator or qualified colocation tenant before the date of revocation.

(c) An owner or operator may appeal any revocation under this paragraph pursuant to chapter 6, article 10 of this title.

H. The authority and the department of revenue shall adopt rules and prescribe forms and procedures as necessary for the purposes of this section. The authority and the department shall collaborate in adopting rules as necessary to avoid duplication and inconsistencies while accomplishing the purposes of this section.  The authority has exclusive authority over issues related to certification, including determinations as to whether a computer data center has satisfied the requirements of subsection E of this section, constitutes a qualified sustainable redevelopment project or has committed a violation of this section.  The department of revenue has exclusive authority over the administration of tax relief.

I. Proprietary business information contained in the application described in subsection B of this section, the written notice described in subsection F of this section and the list described in subsection J of this section are confidential and shall not be disclosed to the public except that the information shall be transmitted to the department of revenue. The authority or the department may disclose the name of a computer data center that has been certified pursuant to this section.

J. The owner or operator shall provide the authority and the department of revenue with a list of qualified colocation tenants, including the commencement and expiration dates of each qualified colocation tenant's agreement to use or occupy all or part of the computer data center, and shall notify the authority and the department of any changes within thirty days. The failure of an owner or operator to provide the list or notify the authority and department of revenue of changes within the required time is not grounds for termination of the computer data center's certification, but may preclude unlisted colocation tenants from receiving tax relief until the list is provided or updated.

K. Except as provided in subsection G of this section, if a computer data center has been certified, the certification remains in effect, even in the event of a future transfer, sale or disposition, directly or indirectly, of the computer data center.

L. For the purposes of qualifying and continuing as a sustainable redevelopment project:

1. After receiving certification, an owner may substantially demolish all or part of an existing building to the extent reasonably necessary to accommodate future computer data center use, and the demolition is not cause for loss of certification as a sustainable redevelopment project. An existing building that has been substantially demolished before certification is not eligible to qualify as a sustainable redevelopment project.

2. An owner or operator may expand the boundaries of a certified computer data center by increasing the size of an existing building within a sustainable redevelopment project or by building additional improvements in an unlimited manner to the extent the expansion is constructed on the same parcel of land on which the original sustainable redevelopment project is located or on a contiguous parcel, regardless of whether the contiguous parcel was within the original description of the boundaries of the certified computer data center.  Expansion activities do not prevent a facility from maintaining its classification as a sustainable redevelopment project.

3. All construction activities and investments related to demolition and expansion activities described in this subsection are considered to be a part of the sustainable redevelopment project.

M. This section does not allow a computer data center to do either of the following:

1. The owner's or operator's name, address and telephone number.

2. The address of the site where the facility is or will be located, including, if applicable, information sufficient to identify the specific portion or portions of the facility comprising the international operations center.

3. An estimate of the total investment the owner or operator or an affiliated entity, including investments made by a third-party entity on behalf of and for the benefit of the owner, operator or affiliated entity, will make, over a three-year period beginning on the date the application is received, in new renewable energy facilities in this state that produce energy for self-consumption by the international operations center using renewable energy resources.

4. The expected location of each of the renewable energy facilities that comprise the total investment estimated in paragraph 3 of this subsection and the earliest date that each facility is expected to be operational.

5. A statement that a portion of the power generated by each renewable energy facility, as required by subsection D, paragraph 4 of this section, is for self-consumption and will be used for international operations center use.

C. Within sixty days after receiving a complete and correct application, the authority shall review the application and either issue a written certification that the international operations center qualifies for the utility relief or provide written reasons for its denial. A failure to approve or deny the application within sixty days after the date of submittal constitutes certification of the international operations center, and the authority shall issue written certification to the owner or operator within fourteen days. The authority shall send a copy of the certification to the department of revenue.

D. The owner or operator of the international operations center must achieve all of the following requirements after taking into account the combined investments made by the owner or operator:

1. A minimum annual investment of $100,000,000 in new capital assets, including costs of land, buildings and international operations center equipment in each of ten consecutive taxable years of the owner or operator. Investments greater than $100,000,000 in any taxable year may be carried forward as a credit toward the investment requirement in future years.

2. On or before the tenth anniversary of certification, a minimum investment of at least $1,250,000,000 in new capital assets, including costs of land, buildings and international operations center equipment.

3. An investment by the owner or operator or an affiliated entity, or a third-party entity on behalf of or for the direct benefit of the owner, operator or affiliated entity, of at least $100,000,000 in one or more new renewable energy facilities in this state that produce energy for self-consumption using renewable energy resources.

Until the requirements prescribed in subsection D of this section are met, the owner or operator shall keep detailed records of all capital investment in the international operations center, including costs of land, buildings and international operations center equipment, and all utility relief directly received by the owner or operator.

F. If the authority determines that the requirements of this section have not been satisfied, the authority may revoke the certification of the international operations center and notify the department of revenue in writing. The owner or operator may appeal the revocation. The authority may give special consideration or allow a temporary exception if there is extraordinary hardship due to factors beyond the owner's or operator's control. If certification is revoked, the department of revenue shall order the owner or operator to forfeit further entitlement to utility relief. If the owner or operator fails to make a minimum capital investment of $100,000,000 in a taxable year, taking into account any excess investment amounts carried forward from previous years, the owner or operator may avoid revocation of its certification by paying to the department of revenue within sixty days after the end of the taxable year the amount of the utility relief provided pursuant to this section in that year.

G. Each year after initial certification, on or before the anniversary date of the application specified in subsection B of this section, the owner, operator or affiliated entity must submit to the authority:

1. Documentation of the owner's, operator's or affiliated entity's progress toward the investment required by subsection D, paragraph 3 of this section. This documentation is not required after the authority receives a report stating that the required investment threshold has been reached.

2. Documentation for each renewable energy facility that demonstrates that the required portion of the power generated by each facility is for self-consumption as required by subsection D, paragraph 4 of this section.

H. The authority and the department of revenue shall prescribe forms and procedures as necessary for the purposes of this section.

I. Proprietary business information contained in the application form described in subsection B of this section and the written notice described in subsection F of this section are confidential and may not be disclosed to the public, except that the information shall be transmitted to the department of revenue.

#### Section 41-1604.06. Earned release credit eligibility certification; classifications; appeal

A. The director shall develop and maintain an earned release credit eligibility classification system. Within such system, the director shall establish one class of earned release credit eligibility to be given effect as provided for in this section and as many other classes of noneligibility as he deems necessary or desirable. Each person committed to the state department of corrections shall be classified pursuant to the earned release credit eligibility system established by the director.

B. The director shall establish rules pursuant to chapter 6 of this title for the classification and certification of prisoners for purposes of earned release credit. An inmate who is placed in a parole eligible classification is also eligible for certification for absolute discharge from imprisonment. Upon commitment to the state department of corrections each person shall be initially placed in the earned release credit noneligible class. Reclassification and certification shall be based on factors related to a prisoner's record while in the custody of the department, including work performance, compliance with all rules of the department, progress in any appropriate education, training or treatment programs and the performance of any assignments of confidence or trust. The director shall also establish rules governing the procedures and performance standards by which prisoners, classified to noneligibility classifications, may earn eligibility classification. Prisoners may be reclassified only pursuant to the rules of the department. The director shall distribute a copy of all such rules to each person committed to the department.

C. Every prisoner shall be entitled to a hearing prior to reclassification of such prisoner to a noneligible earned release credit class. The hearing shall be before a person or persons designated by the director to hold such hearings. Reasonable notice and a written statement of the alleged violation of the rules shall be distributed to the prisoner at least five days prior to the hearing. A prisoner may request a review of a decision to reclassify the prisoner by delivering a written request to the director.

#### Section 41-1604.07. Earned release credits; forfeiture; restoration; released prisoner health care; annual report

A. Pursuant to rules adopted by the director, each prisoner who is in the eligible earned release credit class shall be allowed an earned release credit as set forth in subsection B of this section, including time served in county jails, except for those prisoners who are sentenced to serve the full term of imprisonment imposed by the court.

B. The earned release credit is:

1. Three days for every seven days served if the prisoner:

(a) Was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for the possession or use of marijuana pursuant to section 13-3405, subsection A, paragraph 1, the possession or use of a dangerous drug pursuant to section 13-3407, subsection A, paragraph 1, the possession or use of a narcotic drug pursuant to section 13-3408, subsection A, paragraph 1 or the possession of drug paraphernalia pursuant to section 13-3415.

(b) Has successfully completed a drug treatment program or other major self-improvement program provided by the department during the prisoner's term of imprisonment.

(c) Has not previously been convicted of a violent or aggravated felony as defined in section 13-706.

2. One day for every six days served if the prisoner was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for an offense not listed in paragraph 1 of this subsection.

C. Release credits earned by a prisoner pursuant to subsections A and B of this section shall not reduce the term of imprisonment imposed by the court on the prisoner.

D. On reclassification of a prisoner resulting from the prisoner's failure to adhere to the rules of the department or failure to demonstrate a continual willingness to volunteer for or successfully participate in a work, educational, treatment or training program, the director may declare all release credits earned by the prisoner forfeited.  In the discretion of the director, forfeited release credits may subsequently be restored. The director shall maintain an account of release credits earned by each prisoner.

E. A prisoner who has reached the prisoner's earned release date or sentence expiration date shall be released to begin the prisoner's term of community supervision imposed by the court or term of probation if the court waived community supervision pursuant to section 13-603, except that the director may deny or delay the prisoner's release to community supervision or probation if the director believes the prisoner may be a sexually violent person as defined in section 36-3701 until the screening process is complete and the director determines that the prisoner will not be referred to the county attorney pursuant to section 36-3702. If the term of community supervision is waived, the state department of corrections shall provide reasonable notice to the probation department of the scheduled release of the prisoner from confinement by the department. If the court waives community supervision, the director shall issue the prisoner an absolute discharge on the prisoner's earned release credit date. A prisoner who is released on the earned release credit date to serve a term of probation is not under the control of the state department of corrections when community supervision has been waived and the state department of corrections is not required to provide parole services.

F. Notwithstanding subsection E of this section, a prisoner who fails to achieve functional literacy at an eighth grade literacy level shall not be released to begin the prisoner's term of community supervision until either the prisoner achieves an eighth grade functional literacy level as measured by standardized assessment testing, the prisoner is released to enter the transition program established by section 31-281 and is enrolled in a program that prepares the prisoner to achieve functional literacy or the prisoner serves the full term of imprisonment imposed by the court, whichever first occurs. This subsection does not apply to inmates who either:

1. Are unable to meet the functional literacy standard required by section 31-229.02, subsection A due to a medical, developmental or learning disability as described in section 31-229, subsection C.

2. Are classified as level five offenders.

3. Are foreign nationals.

4. Have less than six months of incarceration to serve on commitment to the department.

5. Are released pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section.

G. The department shall establish conditions of community supervision it deems appropriate in order to ensure that the best interests of the prisoner and the citizens of this state are served.  As a condition of community supervision, the director:

1. May order a released prisoner to participate in an appropriate drug treatment or education program that is administered by a qualified agency, organization or individual approved by the department of health services and that provides treatment or education to persons who abuse controlled substances.  Each person who is enrolled in a drug treatment or education program shall pay for the cost of participation in the program to the extent of the person's financial ability.

2. May order additional conditions, including participation in a rehabilitation program or counseling and performance of community restitution work.

3. Unless the prisoner is released pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section, may order a prisoner to apply for health care benefits through the Arizona health care cost containment system before being released.  The state department of corrections shall enter into an enrollment suspense agreement with the Arizona health care cost containment system to reinstate benefits for prisoners who were sentenced to twelve months or less and who were previously enrolled in the Arizona health care cost containment system immediately before incarceration. For all other prisoners, the state department of corrections shall submit a prerelease application to the Arizona health care cost containment system at least thirty days before the prisoner's release date. The state department of corrections may coordinate with community-based organizations or the department of economic security to assist prisoners in applying for enrollment in the Arizona health care cost containment system.

4. Shall impose, if the prisoner was convicted of a violation of sexual conduct with a minor under fifteen years of age or molestation of a child under fifteen years of age, a prohibition on residing within four hundred forty feet of a school or its accompanying grounds. For the purposes of this paragraph, "school" means any public, charter or private school where children attend classes.

H. The director may exchange a prisoner's health care information with the regional behavioral health authority or Arizona health care cost containment system justice system contact to facilitate the transition to care for released prisoners to access the full array of behavioral and physical health care services, including medication, counseling, case management, substance abuse treatment, and parenting skills and family reunification training. The director shall adopt policies and procedures that establish a care team to convene and discuss the services and resources, including housing and employment supports, that may be needed for the released prisoner to safely transition into the community. The care team shall be managed by the regional behavioral health authority or Arizona health care cost containment system contractor and may include the health care provider that is identified by and has a contract with the regional behavioral health authority or Arizona health care cost containment system contractor. The care team may also include representatives of nonprofit organizations that specialize in assisting prisoners who are transitioning back into the community and other organizations that link prisoners to additional services, including housing and employment.

I. If a prisoner who reaches the prisoner's earned release credit date refuses to sign and agree to abide by the conditions of supervision before release on community supervision, the prisoner shall not be released. When the prisoner reaches the sentence expiration date, the prisoner shall be released to begin the term of community supervision. If the prisoner refuses to sign and agree to abide by the conditions of release, the prisoner shall not be released on the sentence expiration date and shall serve the term of community supervision in prison.  The department is required to supervise any prisoner on community supervision until the period of community supervision expires. The department may bring a prisoner who is in violation of the prisoner's terms and conditions before the board of executive clemency.

J. The director, pursuant to rules adopted by the department, shall authorize the release of any prisoner on the prisoner's earned release credit date to serve any consecutive term imposed on the prisoner. The release shall be for the sentence completed only. The prisoner shall remain under the custody and control of the department.  The director may authorize the rescission of the release to any consecutive term if the prisoner fails to adhere to the rules of the department.

K. If a prisoner absconds from community supervision, any time spent before the prisoner is returned to custody is excluded in calculating the remaining period of community supervision.

L. A prisoner shall forfeit five days of the prisoner's earned release credits:

1. If the court finds or a disciplinary hearing held after a review by and recommendations from the attorney general's office determines that the prisoner does any of the following:

(a) Brings a claim without substantial justification.

(b) Unreasonably expands or delays a proceeding.

(c) Testifies falsely or otherwise presents false information or material to the court.

(d) Submits a claim that is intended solely to harass the party it is filed against.

2. For each time the prisoner tests positive for any prohibited drugs during the period of time the prisoner is incarcerated.

M. If the prisoner does not have five days of earned release credits, the prisoner shall forfeit the prisoner's existing earned release credits and shall be ineligible from accruing earned release credits until the number of earned release credits the prisoner would have otherwise accrued equals the difference between five days and the number of existing earned release credit days the prisoner forfeits pursuant to this section.

N. The director may authorize temporary release on inmate status of eligible inmates pursuant to rules adopted by the director within ninety days of any other authorized release date.  The release authorization applies to any inmate who has been convicted of a drug offense, who has been determined to be eligible for participation in the transition program pursuant to section 31-281 and who has agreed to participate in the transition program.

O. On admission, the department shall provide notice to any prisoner who is potentially eligible for earned release credit pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section. The notice must include all of the eligibility requirements under this section.

P. The department shall do all of the following:

1. Annually report the recidivism rate of prisoners released pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section for a minimum of three years after release.

A. The director shall develop and maintain a parole eligibility classification system. Within the system, the director shall establish two classes of parole eligibility, class one and class two, to be given effect as provided for in this section, one class of parole noneligibility for dangerous psychiatric offenders and as many other classes of noneligibility as the director deems necessary or desirable. Each person committed to the state department of corrections shall be classified pursuant to the parole eligibility system established by the director.

B. The director shall establish rules pursuant to chapter 6 of this title for the classification and certification of prisoners for purposes of parole. Reclassification and certification shall be based on factors related to a prisoner's record while in the custody of the department, including work performance, compliance with all rules of the department, progress in any appropriate training or treatment programs and the performance of any assignments of confidence or trust. The director shall also establish rules governing the procedures and performance standards by which prisoners, reclassified to noneligibility classifications, may earn eligibility classification.  Prisoners may be reclassified only pursuant to the rules of the department. The director shall distribute a copy of all the rules to each person committed to the department.

C. The director shall maintain two classes for parole eligibility, class one and class two. Inclusion of an inmate in class one shall be determined by adherence to the rules of the department and continual willingness to volunteer for or successful participation in a work, educational, treatment or training program established by the department, except that a person sentenced pursuant to a statute that requires that a person serve a mandatory minimum term shall not be placed in class one until one-quarter of the mandatory minimum portion of the term is served and shall not be released until the mandatory minimum portion of the term is served. Inclusion of an inmate in class two shall be determined by adherence to the rules of the department.

D. The director shall certify as eligible for parole any prisoner classified within an eligible classification five months immediately before the prisoner's earliest parole eligibility. The inmate shall be required to remain in a parole eligible classification from the date of certification until the date of release on parole. If the inmate does not remain in a parole eligible classification until the date of release on parole, the entire parole process shall be rescinded. For the purposes of this subsection, the prisoner's earliest parole eligibility occurs when the prisoner has served one-half of the sentence imposed unless the prisoner is sentenced according to any provisions of law that prohibit the release on any basis until serving not less than two-thirds of the sentence imposed by the court, the sentence imposed by the court or any other mandatory minimum term, in which case the prisoner must have served the sentence required by law.

E. Every prisoner shall be entitled to a hearing before reclassification of the prisoner to a lower class. The hearing shall be before a person or persons designated by the director to hold the hearings. Reasonable notice and a written statement of the alleged violation of the rules shall be distributed to the prisoner at least five days before the hearing. A prisoner may request a review of a decision to reclassify the prisoner by delivering a written request to the director.

F. Notwithstanding subsection D of this section, placement of a prisoner in a noneligible parole class except placement in the noneligible parole class for dangerous psychiatric offenders shall result in an increase in the period of time the prisoner must serve before reaching the prisoner's earliest parole eligibility date. The increase shall equal the number of days occurring after placement in a noneligible parole class and before the prisoner is reclassified to a parole eligible class.

G. The classification of each prisoner shall be reviewed by the director not less than once every six months. Any prisoner who was certified as eligible for parole and denied parole and remains eligible for parole pursuant to subsection D of this section shall be recertified by the director not less than one nor more than four months after the hearing at which the prisoner was denied parole, except that the board of executive clemency in denying parole may prescribe that the prisoner shall not be recertified for a period of up to one year after the hearing. The board of executive clemency may adopt rules for the recertification process and may apply specific rules for the recertification process that applies to a prisoner who is serving a sentence for any of the following:

1. Death in violation of section 13-1104 or 13-1105.

2. Serious physical injury if the person was sentenced pursuant to section 13-704.

3. A dangerous crime against children as defined in section 13-705.

4. A felony offense in violation of title 13, chapter 14 or 35.1.

H. Immediately after the adoption of the rules required pursuant to this section, the director shall forward a certified copy of the rules to the legislature. The legislature may review and, by concurrent resolution, approve, disapprove or modify the rules, except that they shall be given full force and effect pending legislative review. If no concurrent resolution is passed by the legislature with respect to the rules within one year following receipt of a certified copy of the rules, they shall be deemed to have been approved by the legislature. If the legislature disapproves the rules or a section of them, the director shall immediately discontinue the use of any procedure, action or proceeding authorized or required by the rules or section of the rules.

I. This section applies to either of the following:

1. A person who commits a felony offense before January 1, 1994.

2. A person who is sentenced to life imprisonment and who is eligible for parole pursuant to section 13-716 or 13-718.

J. Pursuant to rules adopted by the director, on commitment to the department, each prisoner shall be placed in parole class one beginning on the prisoner's sentence begin date.

K. For the purposes of this section, "dangerous psychiatric offender" means an inmate who has been placed in a psychiatric unit for psychiatric evaluation and treatment and who has been determined to present a high risk of potential violence.

#### Section 41-1604.10. Earned release credits; forfeiture; restoration; applicability

A. Each prisoner classified as parole eligible, class one, pursuant to section 41-1604.09, shall be allowed the following release credits:

1. If sentenced on a first conviction other than pursuant to section 13-751 or other than for a felony involving a dangerous offense as defined in section 13-105, every two days served within class one shall be counted as an earned release credit of one day.

2. If sentenced pursuant to section 13-703, subsection B or on first conviction of a class 4, 5 or 6 felony involving a dangerous offense as defined in section 13-105 or any other provisions of law that prohibits release on any basis until serving not less than one-half the sentence imposed by the court, every two days served within class one shall be counted as an earned release credit of one day.

3. If sentenced pursuant to any other provision of section 13-703, section 13-704, subsection A, B, C, D or E, section 13-706, subsection A or section 13-708, subsection D or any other provision of law that prohibits release on any basis until serving not less than two-thirds the sentence imposed by the court, every three days served within class one shall be counted as an earned release credit of one day.

B. Release credits earned by a prisoner pursuant to subsection A of this section shall not reduce the term of imprisonment imposed by the court on such prisoner, nor reduce the sentence imposed on the prisoner for the purpose of determining such prisoner's parole eligibility.

C. On reclassification of a prisoner resulting from the prisoner's failure to adhere to the rules of the department or failure to demonstrate a continual willingness to volunteer for or successfully participate in a work, educational, treatment or training program, the director may declare any and all release credits earned by the prisoner forfeited. In the discretion of the director the release credits may subsequently be restored.  The director shall maintain an account of release credits earned by each prisoner.

D. The director, according to rules adopted by the department, may authorize the release of any prisoner who has earned release credits that, when added to the time served by the prisoner, equal the sentence imposed by the court which shall be the prisoner's earned release credit date. A prisoner on earned release credit release is not under the control of the department and the department is not required to provide parole services or otherwise supervise any prisoner released, except that the department may revoke the release of the prisoner until the final expiration of the prisoner's sentence if the department has reason to believe that the released prisoner has engaged in criminal conduct during the term of release. If a prisoner has a term of probation to be completed or served, the probation department shall begin supervision of the prisoner when the prisoner is released on the earned release credit date. If the prisoner's term of probation equals or exceeds the prisoner's final expiration date, the director of the state department of corrections shall issue the prisoner an absolute discharge on the prisoner's earned release credit date. The prisoner is not under the control of the department and the department is not required to provide parole services or otherwise supervise the prisoner. If the prisoner's term of probation is less than the prisoner's final expiration date, the prisoner is not under the control of the department and the department is not required to provide parole services or otherwise supervise the prisoner, except that the department may revoke the release at any time between the earned release credit date and the final expiration date if the department has reason to believe that the released prisoner has engaged in criminal conduct during the term of release. The director may issue the prisoner an absolute discharge from the sentence of imprisonment if it appears that the prisoner will live and remain at liberty without violating the law and it is in the best interest of the state. The state department of corrections shall provide reasonable notice to the probation department of the scheduled release of the prisoner from confinement by the state department of corrections.

E. A prisoner shall forfeit five days of the prisoner's earned release credits if the court finds or a disciplinary hearing held after a review by and recommendations from the attorney general's office determines that the prisoner does any of the following:

1. Brings a claim without substantial justification.

2. Unreasonably expands or delays a proceeding.

3. Testifies falsely or otherwise presents false information or material to the court.

4. Submits a claim that is intended solely to harass the party it is filed against.

F. If the prisoner does not have five days of earned release credits, the prisoner shall forfeit the prisoner's existing earned release credits and be ineligible from accruing earned release credits until the number of earned release credits the prisoner would have otherwise accrued equals the difference between five days and the number of existing earned release credit days the prisoner forfeits pursuant to this section.

G. This section applies only to persons who commit felonies before January 1, 1994.

 

#### Section 41-1604.11. Order for removal; purposes; duration; work furlough; notice; failure to return; classification; applicability; definition

A. The director of the state department of corrections may authorize the temporary removal under custody from prison or any other institution for the detention of adults under the jurisdiction of the state department of corrections of any inmate for the purpose of employing that inmate in any work directly connected with the administration, management or maintenance of the prison or institution in which the inmate is confined, for purposes of cooperating voluntarily in medical research that cannot be performed at the prison or institution, or for participating in community action activities directed toward delinquency prevention and community betterment programs. The removal shall not be for a period longer than one day.

B.

C. The board of executive clemency, under specific rules established for the selection of inmates, if it appears to the board, in its sole discretion, that there is a substantial probability that the inmate will remain at liberty without violating the law and that the release is in the best interests of the state, may authorize the release of an inmate on work furlough if the inmate has served not less than six months of the sentence imposed by the court, is within twelve months of the inmate's parole eligibility date and has not been convicted of a sexual offense. The director shall provide information as the board requests concerning any inmate eligible for release on work furlough.  The inmate shall not be released on work furlough unless the release is approved by the board.

E. Before holding a hearing on the work furlough under consideration, the board, on request, shall notify and afford an opportunity to be heard to the presiding judge of the superior court in the county in which the inmate requesting a work furlough was sentenced, the prosecuting attorney, the director of the arresting law enforcement agency and the victim of the offense for which the inmate is incarcerated.  The notice shall state the name of the inmate requesting the work furlough, the offense for which the inmate was sentenced, the length of the sentence and the date of admission to the custody of the state department of corrections.  The notice to the victim shall also inform the victim of the victim's right to be present and submit a written report to the board expressing the victim's opinion concerning the inmate's release.  A hearing concerning work furlough shall not be held until fifteen days after the date of giving the notice.  On mailing the notice, the board shall file a hard copy of the notice as evidence that notification was sent.

F. The board shall require that every inmate released on work furlough comply with the terms and conditions of release as the board may impose, including that the inmate be gainfully employed while on work furlough and that the inmate make restitution to the victim of the offense for which the inmate was incarcerated.

G. If the board finds that an inmate has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of release or that the best interests of this state would be served by revocation of an inmate's work furlough, the board may issue a warrant for retaking the inmate before the expiration of the inmate's maximum sentence. After return of the inmate, the board may revoke the inmate's work furlough after the inmate has been given an opportunity to be heard.

H. If the board denies the release of an inmate on work furlough or home arrest, the board may prescribe that the inmate not be recommended again for release on work furlough or home arrest for a period of up to one year.

I. The director shall transmit a monthly report containing the name, date of birth, offense for which the inmate was sentenced, length of the sentence and date of admission to the state department of corrections of each inmate on work furlough or home arrest to the chairperson of the house of representatives judiciary committee or its successor committee and the chairperson of the senate judiciary committee or its successor committee. The director shall also submit a report containing this information for any inmate released on work furlough or home arrest within a jurisdiction to the county attorney, sheriff and chief of police for the jurisdiction in which the inmate is released on work furlough or home arrest.

J. Any inmate who knowingly fails to return from furlough, home arrest, work furlough or temporary removal or temporary release granted under this section is guilty of a class 5 felony.

K. At any given time if the director declares there is a shortage of beds available for inmates within the state department of corrections, the parole eligibility as set forth in sections 31-411 and 41-1604.09 may be suspended for any inmate who has served not less than six months of the sentence imposed by the court, who has not been previously convicted of a felony and who has been sentenced for a class 4, 5 or 6 felony, not involving a sexual offense, the use or exhibition of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument or the infliction of serious physical injury pursuant to section 13-704, and the inmate shall be continuously eligible for parole, home arrest or work furlough.

When the contract is fifty per cent completed, one-half of the amount retained or securities substituted pursuant to this section shall be paid to the contractor upon the contractor's request provided the contractor is making satisfactory progress on the contract and there is no specific cause or claim requiring a greater amount to be retained. After the contract is fifty per cent completed, no more than five per cent of the amount of any subsequent progress payments made under the contract shall be retained providing the contractor is making satisfactory progress on the project, except that if at any time the state determines satisfactory progress is not being made ten per cent retention shall be reinstated for all progress payments made under the contract subsequent to the determination.

C. Any retention shall be paid or substitute security shall be returned to the contractor within sixty days after final completion and acceptance of work under the contract.  Retention of payments by a purchasing agency longer than sixty days after final completion and acceptance requires a specific written finding by the purchasing agency of the reasons justifying the delay in payment.  No purchasing agency may retain any monies after sixty days which are in excess of the amount necessary to pay the expenses the purchasing agency reasonably expects to incur in order to pay or discharge the expenses determined by the finding justifying the retention of monies.

D. This state shall not accept any substitute security unless accompanied by a signed and acknowledged waiver of any right or power of the obligor to set off any claim against either the state governmental unit or the contractor in relationship to the security assigned.  In any instance in which this state accepts substitute security as provided in this section, any subcontractor undertaking to perform any part of the contract is entitled to provide such security to the contractor.

E. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section or in any other law:

1. There shall be no retention for job-order-contracting construction services contracts and the purchasing agency may elect to have no retention for construction-manager-at-risk and design-build construction services contracts.

2. This section applies only to amounts payable in a construction services contract for construction and does not apply to amounts payable in a construction services contract for design services, preconstruction services, finance services, maintenance services, operations services or any other related services included in the contract.

 

#### Section 41-2577. Progress payments; changed or additional work; attorney fees; definitions

A. Progress payments may be made by this state to the contractor on the basis of a duly certified and approved estimate of the work performed during a preceding period of time as set by rule, except that a percentage of all estimates shall be retained as provided in section 41-2576. The progress payments shall be paid on or before fourteen days after the estimate of the work is certified and approved. The estimate of the work shall be deemed received by the owner on submission to any person designated by the owner for the submission, review or approval of the estimate of the work. An estimate of the work submitted under this section shall be deemed approved and certified seven days after the date of submission unless before that time the owner or owner's agent prepares and issues a specific written finding detailing those items in the estimate of the work that are not approved and certified under the contract or design professional service contract. The owner may withhold an amount from the progress payment sufficient to pay the expenses the owner reasonably expects to incur in correcting the deficiency set forth in the written finding. On completion and acceptance of separate divisions of the contract or design professional service contract on which the price is stated separately in the contract or design professional service contract, payment may be made in full including retained percentages, less deductions, unless a substitute security has been provided pursuant to section 41-2576. A contract for construction or design professional services may not materially alter the rights of any contractor, subcontractor, design professional or material supplier to receive prompt and timely payment as provided under this section.

B. The contractor shall pay to the contractor's subcontractors, design professionals or material suppliers and each subcontractor shall pay to the subcontractor's subcontractor, design professional or material supplier, within seven days after receipt of each progress payment, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, the respective amounts allowed the contractor, subcontractor or design professional on account of the work performed by the contractor's or subcontractor's subcontractors or design professionals, to the extent of each such subcontractor's or design professional's interest therein, except that a contract for construction may not materially alter the rights of any contractor, subcontractor, design professional or material supplier to receive prompt and timely payment as provided under this section. These payments to subcontractors, design professionals or material suppliers shall be based on payments received pursuant to this section. Any diversion by the contractor, subcontractor or design professional of payments received for work performed on a contract, or failure to reasonably account for the application or use of such payments, constitutes grounds for disciplinary action by the registrar of contractors. The subcontractor, design professional or material supplier shall notify the registrar of contractors and the purchasing agency in writing of any payment less than the amount or percentage approved for the class or item of work or design professional services as set forth in this section.

C. A subcontractor or design professional may notify the purchasing agency in writing requesting that the subcontractor or design professional be notified by the purchasing agency in writing within five days after payment of each progress payment that is made to the contractor. The subcontractor's or design professional's request remains in effect for the duration of the subcontractor's or design professional's work on the project.

D. This chapter does not prevent the contractor or subcontractor, at the time of application and certification to the owner or contractor, from withholding such application and certification to the owner or contractor for payment to the subcontractor, design professional or material supplier for unsatisfactory job progress, defective construction work or design professional services or materials not remedied, disputed work or materials, third-party claims filed or reasonable evidence that a claim will be filed, failure of a subcontractor or design professional to make timely payments for labor, equipment and materials or design professional services, damage to the contractor or another subcontractor or design professional, reasonable evidence that the subcontract or design professional service contract cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract or design professional service contract sum or a reasonable amount for retention that does not exceed the actual percentage retained by the owner.

E. If any payment to a contractor is delayed after the date due, interest shall be paid at the rate of one percent per month or a fraction of the month on such unpaid balance as may be due.

F. If any periodic or final payment to a subcontractor or design professional is delayed by more than seven days after receipt of periodic or final payment by the contractor or subcontractor, the contractor or subcontractor shall pay the contractor's or subcontractor's subcontractor, design professional or material supplier interest, beginning on the eighth day, at the rate of one percent per calendar month or a fraction of a calendar month on such unpaid balance as may be due.

G. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, this section applies only to amounts payable in a construction services contract for construction and in a contract for design services and does not apply to amounts payable in a contract for preconstruction services, finance services, maintenance services, operations services or any other related services included in the contract.

H. If the owner directs the contractor in writing to perform changed or additional work in accordance with the construction contract and the contractor submits to the owner a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract, pending a final determination of the total amount to be paid for the changed or additional work, the contractor may request payment for changed or additional work that the contractor completed during the preceding calendar month in monthly pay estimates based on the costs the contractor incurred to perform that work.  The person designated in the construction contract to certify and approve the monthly payment estimate shall make an interim determination for purposes of approval for payment of those costs and certify for payment the amount that person determines to be reasonably justified.  Either party may disagree with the interim determination and may assert a claim in accordance with the terms of the construction contract.

I. If the owner directs the contractor in writing to perform changed or additional work in accordance with the construction contract and the contractor submits to the owner a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract and if the contractor directs the subcontractor to perform the changed or additional work in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the contractor and subcontractor and the subcontractor submits to the contractor a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract, pending a final determination of the total amount to be paid for the changed or additional work, the subcontractor may request payment from the contractor for the changed or additional work that the subcontractor completed during the preceding calendar month in monthly pay estimates based on the costs the subcontractor incurred to perform that work. Either party may disagree with the interim determination and may assert a claim in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the contractor and subcontractor.

J. In any action or arbitration brought pursuant to this section, the successful party shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs.

K. For the purposes of this section:

1. Contractor does not include an agricultural improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 17, an electric cooperative formed pursuant to title 10, chapter 19, article 2 or 4 or a domestic water improvement district or a domestic wastewater improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 6, article 4.

2. "Costs" means the aggregate cost of all labor, materials, equipment and services.

3. Subcontractor does not include an agricultural improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 17, an electric cooperative formed pursuant to title 10, chapter 19, article 2 or 4 or a domestic water improvement district or a domestic wastewater improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 6, article 4.

4. "Work" means the labor, materials, equipment and services to be provided by a contractor or subcontractor under a construction contract.

 

#### Section 41-2578. Procurement of specified professional and construction services; definition

A. Except as authorized by sections 41-2535, 41-2536, 41-2537 and 41-2581, a single contract for architect services, assayer services, construction-manager-at-risk construction services, design-build construction services, engineer services, job-order-contracting construction services, geologist services, landscape architect services and land surveying services shall be procured as provided in this section.

B. This state shall provide notice, in accordance with rules, of each procurement of a single contract for professional services or construction services specified in this section and shall award the single contract on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services or construction services pursuant to procedures prescribed in this section.

C. In the procurement of a single contract for professional services or construction services pursuant to this section:

1. The following requirements apply:

(a) The purchasing agency and the selection committee shall not request or consider fees, price, man-hours or any other cost information at any point in the selection process under this subsection or under subsection D of this section, including the selection of persons or firms to be interviewed, the selection of persons or firms to be on the final list, in determining the order of preference of persons or firms on the final list or for any other purpose in the selection process.

(b) In determining the persons or firms to participate in any interviews and in determining the persons and firms to be on the final list and their order on the final list, the selection committee shall use and shall consider only the criteria and weighting of criteria specified by the purchasing agency for that purpose as provided in this subsection.  No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation, determinations and other actions.

(c) A purchasing agency is limited to one contract in each procurement under this section.  Alternatively:

(i) For construction-manager-at-risk construction services, a purchasing agency may elect separate contracts for preconstruction services during the design phase, for construction during the construction phase and for any other construction services.

(ii) For design-build construction services, a purchasing agency may elect separate contracts for preconstruction services and design services during the design phase, for construction and design services during the construction phase and for any other construction services.

(iii) For professional services, a purchasing agency may enter into multiple contracts for different phases of a single project.

(d) All construction-manager-at-risk construction services or design-build construction services included in a procurement under this section shall be limited to construction services to be performed at a single location, a common location or, if the construction services are all for a similar purpose, multiple locations.  For construction-manager-at-risk construction services and design-build construction services to be performed at multiple locations:

(i) At the time the request for qualifications is issued, the purchasing agency must intend to commence all construction at each location within thirty months after execution of the first contract for preconstruction services or other construction services at any of the locations.

(ii) The request for qualifications must include the information described in paragraph 2, subdivision (g) of this subsection.

(e) If the purchasing agency enters into the first contract for preconstruction services, construction services or professional services as the result of the procurement, the procurement under this section ends.  After execution of that first contract the purchasing agency may not use the procurement or the existing final list in the procurement as the basis for entering into a contract with any other person or firm that participated in the procurement.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section specifying the number of persons or firms to be interviewed, the number of persons or firms to be on a final list or any other numerical specification in this section:

(i) If a smaller number of persons or firms respond to the request for qualifications or if one or more persons or firms drop out of the procurement so that there is a smaller number of persons or firms participating in the procurement, the purchasing agency, as the purchasing agency determines necessary or appropriate, may elect to proceed with the procurement with the participating persons or firms if there are at least two participating responsive and responsible persons or firms. Alternatively, the purchasing agency may elect to terminate the procurement.

(ii) As to a request for qualifications for professional services or construction services to be negotiated pursuant to subsection E of this section only, if only one responsive and responsible person or firm responds to the request for qualifications or if one or more persons or firms drop out of the procurement so that only one responsive and responsible person or firm remains in the procurement, the director may elect to proceed with the procurement with only one person or firm if the director determines in writing that the fee negotiated pursuant to subsection E of this section is fair and reasonable and that either other prospective persons or firms had reasonable opportunity to respond or there is not adequate time for a resolicitation.

(iii) If a person or firm on the final list withdraws or is removed from the procurement and the selection committee determines that it is in the best interest of the state, the selection committee may replace that person or firm on the final list with another person or firm that submitted qualifications in the procurement and that is selected by the selection committee as the next most qualified.

2. The purchasing agency shall issue a request for qualifications for each procurement and give adequate public notice of the request for qualifications in the same manner as provided in section 41-2533. The request for qualifications shall:

(a) State that one contract may or will be awarded, describe the services to be performed under the contract and state that one person or firm may or will be awarded the contract.

(b) In a procurement of a contract to be negotiated under subsection E of this section, state that there will be a single final list of at least three and not more than five persons or firms. In a procurement in which the contract will be awarded under subsection F of this section, state that there will be a single final list and that the number of persons or firms on the final list will be three.

(c) As prescribed below, state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used by the selection committee, except that for construction services one of the criteria shall be the person's or firm's subcontractor selection plan or procedures to implement the purchasing agency's subcontractor selection plan.  All selection criteria under this subsection shall be factors that demonstrate competence and qualifications for the type of professional services or construction services included in the procurement.  If:

(i) Interviews will be held, the request for qualifications shall state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms to be interviewed and the request for qualifications may state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms on the final list and in determining their order on the final list. The final list selection criteria and relative weights may be different than the selection criteria and relative weights used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed. The request for qualifications also shall state whether the purchasing agency will select the persons or firms on the final list and their order on the final list solely through the results of the interview process or through the combined results of both the interview process and the evaluation of statements of qualifications and performance data submitted in response to the purchasing agency's request for qualifications.

(ii) Interviews will not be held, the request for qualifications shall state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms on the final list and in determining their order on the final list.

(d) If the purchasing agency will hold interviews as part of the selection process, state that interviews will be held and that the interviews will be with at least three and no more than five persons or firms.

(e) For procurements of construction services, include either:

(i) A requirement that each person or firm submit a proposed subcontractor selection plan and a requirement that the proposed subcontractor selection plan must select subcontractors based on qualifications alone or on a combination of qualifications and price and shall not select subcontractors based on price alone.

(ii) A subcontractor selection plan adopted by the purchasing agency that applies to the person or firm that is selected to perform the construction services and that requires subcontractors to be selected based on qualifications alone or on a combination of qualifications and price and not based on price alone and a requirement that each person or firm must submit a description of the procedures it proposes to use to implement the purchasing agency's subcontractor selection plan.

(f) Include a description of the publicly available location of the purchasing agency's protest policy and procedures or, if the purchasing agency does not have a protest policy and procedures, a statement that the protest policy and procedures referred to in subsection J of this section apply to any protests in connection with the procurement.

(g) In a procurement of construction-manager-at-risk construction services or design-build construction services to be performed at multiple locations, include:

(i) A brief description of the construction services to be performed at each location.

(ii) The estimated budget for the construction services to be performed at each location.

(iii) A schedule for the construction services to be performed at each location that shows the purchasing agency's intent to commence all construction at each location within thirty months after execution of the first contract for preconstruction services or other construction services at any of the locations.

3. The director or head of a purchasing agency shall initiate an appropriately qualified selection committee for each request for qualifications in accordance with rules adopted by the director. The director or head of a purchasing agency shall ensure that the selection committee members are competent to serve on the selection committee.  Each selection committee must include one employee of the purchasing agency or a purchasing agency representative appointed by the purchasing agency. If procuring professional services, the purchasing agency shall determine the number and qualifications of the selection committee members. A selection committee for the procurement of construction services shall not have more than seven members and shall include at least one person who is a senior management employee of a licensed contractor and one person who is an architect or an engineer who is registered pursuant to section 32-121.  These members may be employees of the purchasing agency or outside consultants.  Outside contractors, architects and engineers serving on a selection committee shall not receive compensation from the purchasing agency for performing this service, but the purchasing agency may elect to reimburse outside contractors, architects and engineers for travel, lodging and other expenses incurred in connection with service on a selection committee. A person who is a member of a selection committee shall not be a contractor under a contract awarded under the procurement or provide any professional services, construction, construction services, materials or other services under the contract.  The selection committee and the purchasing agency shall do the following:

(a) If interviews are specified in the request for qualifications:

(i) The selection committee shall determine the person or firms to be interviewed by evaluating the statements of qualifications and performance data that are submitted in response to the purchasing agency's request for qualifications based only on the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria stated in the request for qualifications to be used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.

(ii) If the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used by the selection committee to select the persons or firms on the final list and to determine their order on the final list are not included in the request for qualifications, before the interviews are held the purchasing agency shall distribute to the persons or firms to be interviewed the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used to select the persons or firms on the final list and to determine their order on the final list. These selection criteria and relative weight may be different than the selection criteria and relative weight used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.

(iii) The selection committee shall conduct interviews with at least three but not more than five persons or firms as specified in the request for qualifications regarding the professional services or construction services and the relative methods of approach for furnishing the required professional services or construction services.

(b) Based only on the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria specified as provided in this subsection for selection of the persons or firms on the final list and their order on the final list, the selection committee shall select the persons or firms for the final list and, in the case of a final list for a contract that will be negotiated under subsection E of this section, rank the three persons or firms on the final list in order of preference.

(c) If the contract will be negotiated under subsection E of this section, before or at the same time as the purchasing agency notifies the highest ranking person or firm on the final list that it is the highest ranking person or firm, the purchasing agency shall send actual notice to each of the following that it is not the highest person or firm on the final list or that another person or firm is the highest ranking person or firm on the final list:

(i) If interviews were held, the other persons and firms interviewed.

(ii) If interviews were not held, the other persons and firms that made submittals.

(d) If the contract will be awarded under subsection F of this section, before or at the same time as the purchasing agency notifies the persons or firms on the final list that they are on the final list, the purchasing agency shall send actual notice to each of the following persons or firms that they are not on the final list or that other persons or firms are on the final list:

(i) If interviews were held, the other persons or firms interviewed.

(ii) If interviews were not held, the other persons or firms that made submittals.

D. The director shall award the single contract under the procurement as provided in subsection E or F of this section.

E. The procurement officer shall conduct negotiations with persons or firms on the final list as follows:

1. The procurement is for a single contract for construction services or professional services, and there is one final list.

2. The negotiations shall include consideration of compensation and other contract terms that the procurement officer determines to be fair and reasonable to the procurement officer. In making this decision, the procurement officer shall take into account the estimated value, the scope, the complexity and the nature of the professional services or construction services to be rendered.

3. The procurement officer shall enter into negotiations with the highest qualified person or firm on the final list.

4. If the procurement officer is not able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the highest qualified person or firm on the final list, at compensation and on other contract terms the procurement officer determines to be fair and reasonable to this state, the procurement officer shall formally terminate negotiations with that person or firm. The procurement officer shall then undertake negotiations with the next most qualified person or firm on the final list in sequence until an agreement is reached or a determination is made to reject all persons or firms on the final list.

5. If, in a procurement under this section, the procurement officer terminates negotiations with a person or firm on the final list and commences negotiations with another person or firm on the final list, the procurement officer shall not in that procurement recommence negotiations or enter into a contract for the construction services or professional services covered by the final list with any person or firm on the final list with whom the procurement officer has terminated negotiations.

F. As an alternative to subsection E of this section, the procurement officer may award a single contract for design-build construction services or job-order-contracting construction services as follows:

1. The procurement officer shall use the selection committee appointed for the request for qualifications pursuant to subsection C of this section.

2. The procurement officer shall issue a request for proposals to the persons or firms on the final list developed pursuant to subsection C of this section.

3. The request for proposals shall include:

(a) The purchasing agency's project schedule and project final budget for design and construction or life cycle budget for a procurement that includes maintenance services or operations services.

(b) A statement that the contract will be awarded to the person or firm whose proposal receives the highest number of points under a scoring method.

(c) A description of the scoring method, including a list of the factors in the scoring method and the number of points allocated to each factor.  The factors in the scoring method may include:

(i) For design-build construction services only, demonstrated compliance with the design requirements.

(ii) Offeror qualifications.

(iii) Offeror financial capacity.

(iv) Compliance with the purchasing agency's project schedule.

(v) For design-build construction services only, if the request for proposals specifies that the purchasing agency will spend its project budget and not more than its project budget and is seeking the best proposal for the project budget, compliance of the offeror's price or life cycle price for procurements that include maintenance services, operations services or finance services with the purchasing agency's budget as prescribed in the request for proposals.

(vi) For design-build construction services if the request for proposals does not contain the specifications prescribed in item (v) and for job-order-contracting construction services, the price or life cycle price for procurements that include maintenance services, operations services or finance services.

(vii) An offeror quality management plan.

(viii) Other evaluation factors that demonstrate competence and qualifications for the type of construction services in the request for proposals as determined by the purchasing agency, if any.

(d) For design-build construction services only, the design requirements.

(e) A requirement that each offeror submit separately a technical proposal and a price proposal and that the offeror's entire proposal be responsive to the requirements in the request for proposals. For design-build construction services, the price in the price proposal shall be a fixed price or a guaranteed maximum price.

(f) A statement that in applying the scoring method the selection committee will separately evaluate the technical proposal and the price proposal and will evaluate and score the technical proposal before opening the price proposal.

(g) If the purchasing agency conducts discussions pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection, a statement that discussions will be held and a requirement that each offeror submit a preliminary technical proposal before the discussions are held.

4. If the purchasing agency determines to conduct discussions pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection, each offeror shall submit a preliminary technical proposal to the purchasing agency before those discussions are held.

5. If determined by the purchasing agency and included by the purchasing agency in the request for proposals, the selection committee shall conduct discussions with all offerors that submit preliminary technical proposals.  Discussions shall be for the purpose of clarification to ensure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and for clarification by the owner.  Revision of preliminary technical proposals shall be permitted after submission of preliminary technical proposals and before award for the purpose of obtaining best and final proposals. In conducting any discussions, information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors shall not be disclosed to other competing offerors.

6. After completion of any discussions pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection or if no discussions are held, each offeror shall submit separately its final technical proposal and its price proposal.

7. Before opening any price proposal, the selection committee shall open the final technical proposals, evaluate the final technical proposals and score the final technical proposals using the scoring method in the request for proposals.  No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation and scoring.

8. After completion of the evaluation and scoring of all final technical proposals, the selection committee shall open the price proposals, evaluate the price proposals, score the price proposals and complete the scoring of the entire proposals using the scoring method in the request for proposals.  No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation and scoring.

9. The procurement officer shall award the contract or contracts to the responsive and responsible offeror whose proposal receives the highest score under the method of scoring in the request for proposals.  No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation.  Before or at the same time as the purchasing agency notifies the winning offeror that it has won, the purchasing agency shall send actual notice to each other offeror either that the offeror has not won or that another offeror has won.

10. The contract or contracts file shall contain the basis on which the award is made, including at a minimum the information and documents required under subsection G of this section.

11. For design-build construction services only, the procurement officer shall award a stipulated fee equal to a percentage, as prescribed in the request for proposals, of the purchasing agency's project final budget for design and construction, as prescribed in the request for proposals, but not less than two-tenths of one per cent of the project final budget for design and construction to each final list offeror who provides a responsive, but unsuccessful, proposal. If the procurement officer does not award a contract, all responsive final list offerors shall receive the stipulated fee based on the purchasing agency's project final budget for design and construction as included in the request for proposals.  The procurement officer shall pay the stipulated fee to each offeror within ninety days after the award of the initial contract or the decision not to award a contract. In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the procurement officer may use any ideas or information contained in the proposals in connection with any contract awarded for the project, or in connection with a subsequent procurement, without any obligation to pay any additional compensation to the offerors.  Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, an offeror may elect to waive the stipulated fee.  If an offeror elects to waive the stipulated fee, the purchasing agency may not use ideas and information contained in the offeror's proposal, except that this restriction does not prevent the purchasing agency from using any idea or information if the idea or information is also included in a proposal of an offeror that accepts the stipulated fee.

G. At a minimum, the purchasing agency shall retain the following for each procurement under this section:

#### Section 41-2579. Procurement of multiple contacts for certain job-order-contracting construction services and certain professional services; definition

A. Except as authorized in this section and in sections 41-2535, 41-2536, 41-2537 and 41-2581, a purchasing agency shall not procure in a single procurement multiple contracts for construction services or professional services. In a procurement under this section, there is a single procurement process for all of the multiple contracts included in the procurement.  A purchasing agency may procure under this section:

1. Multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms.

2. Multiple contracts for professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms or to be awarded to a single person or firm as specified in the request for qualifications.

B. A purchasing agency shall provide notice of each procurement under this section and shall award contracts on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications for the type of professional services or construction services pursuant to the procedures prescribed in this section.

C. In a procurement pursuant to this section:

1. The following requirements apply:

(a) The purchasing agency and the selection committee shall not request or consider fees, price, man-hours or any other cost information at any point in the selection process under this subsection or under subsection D of this section, including the selection of persons or firms to be interviewed, the selection of persons or firms to be on a final list, in determining the order of preference of persons or firms on a final list or for any other purpose in the selection process.

(b) In determining the persons or firms to participate in any interviews and in determining the persons and firms to be on a final list and their order on a final list, the selection committee shall use and shall consider only the criteria and weighting of criteria specified by the purchasing agency for that purpose as provided in this subsection.  No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation, determinations and other actions.

(c) If the purchasing agency enters into the number of multiple contracts being procured for job-order-contracting construction services or professional services, a procurement under this section ends.  After that time the purchasing agency may not use the procurement or any existing final list in the procurement as the basis for entering into a replacement contract with any other person or firm that participated in the procurement.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section specifying the number of persons or firms to be interviewed, the number of persons or firms to be on a final list or any other numerical specification in this section:

(i) If a smaller number of persons or firms respond to the request for qualifications or if one or more persons or firms drop out of the procurement so that there is a smaller number of persons or firms participating in the procurement, the purchasing agency, as the purchasing agency determines necessary or appropriate, may elect to proceed with the procurement with the participating persons or firms if there are at least two participating responsive and responsible persons or firms. Alternatively, the purchasing agency may elect to terminate the procurement.

(ii) As to a request for qualifications for professional services or job-order-contracting construction services to be negotiated pursuant to subsection E of this section only, if only one responsive and responsible person or firm responds to the request for qualifications or if one or more persons or firms drop out of the procurement so that only one responsive and responsible person or firm remains in the procurement, the director may elect to proceed with the procurement with only one person or firm if the director determines in writing that the fee negotiated pursuant to subsection E of this section is fair and reasonable and that either other prospective persons or firms had reasonable opportunity to respond or there is not adequate time for a resolicitation.

(iii) If a person or firm on a final list withdraws or is removed from the procurement and the selection committee determines that it is in the best interest of this state, the selection committee may replace that person or firm on the final list with another person or firm that submitted qualifications in the procurement and that is selected by the selection committee as the next most qualified.

2. The purchasing agency shall issue a request for qualifications for each procurement and give adequate public notice of the request for qualifications in the same manner as provided in section 41-2533. The publication shall include the fact that multiple contracts may or will be awarded, shall state the number of contracts that may or will be awarded and shall describe the professional services or job-order-contracting construction services to be performed under each contract.  The request for qualifications shall:

(a) State the following information about the contracts that may or will be awarded:

(i) If the request for qualifications is for multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, that multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services may or will be awarded, the number of contracts that may or will be awarded, the services to be performed under each of the multiple contracts and that each of the multiple contracts will be awarded to a separate person or firm.

(ii) If the request for qualifications is for multiple contracts for professional services, that multiple contracts for professional services may or will be awarded, the number of contracts that may or will be awarded, the services to be performed under each of the multiple contracts and either that each of the multiple contracts will be awarded to a separate person or firm or that all of the multiple contracts will be awarded to the same person or firm.

(b) State as to final lists:

(i) In a procurement of multiple contracts for professional services to be awarded to a single person or firm, that there will be a single final list of not more than ten persons or firms.

(ii) In a procurement for multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms or in a procurement for multiple contracts for similar professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, that there will be a single final list and the number of persons or firms on the final list, which shall be the sum of the number of contracts that may or will be awarded and a number that is determined by the purchasing agency and that is not more than ten.

(iii) In a procurement for multiple contracts for different professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, that there will be a separate final list for each type of professional services and that the number of persons or firms on each final list will be the number of contracts that may or will be awarded for each type of professional services and a number that is determined by the purchasing agency and that is not more than ten.

(c) As prescribed below, state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used by the selection committee, except that in a procurement for multiple contracts for job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms one of the criteria shall be the person's or firm's subcontractor selection plan or procedures to implement the purchasing agency's subcontractor selection plan.  All selection criteria under this subsection shall be factors that demonstrate competence and qualifications for the type of professional services or job-order-contracting construction services included in the procurement.  If:

(i) Interviews will be held, the request for qualifications shall state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms to be interviewed and the request for qualifications may state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms on each final list and in determining their order on each final list.  The final list selection criteria and relative weights may be different than the selection criteria and relative weights used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.  The request for qualifications also shall state whether the purchasing agency will select the persons or firms on the final list and their order on the final list solely through the results of the interview process or through the combined results of both the interview process and the evaluation of statements of qualifications and performance data submitted in response to the purchasing agency's request for qualifications.

(ii) Interviews will not be held, the request for qualifications shall state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms on each final list and in determining their order on each final list.

(d) If the purchasing agency will hold interviews as part of the selection process:

(i) In a procurement of multiple contracts for professional services to be awarded to the same person or firm, state that interviews will be held and that the interviews will be with not more than ten persons or firms.

(ii) In a procurement of multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms or in a procurement of multiple contracts for similar professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, state that interviews will be held and that the interviews will be with a specified number of persons or firms.  The specified number shall be stated in the request for qualifications, shall be determined by the purchasing agency and shall be not more than ten persons or firms.

(iii) In a procurement of multiple contracts for different professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, state that interviews will be held and that the interviews will be with a specified number of persons or firms. The specified number shall be stated in the request for qualifications, shall be determined by the purchasing agency and shall be not more than ten persons or firms.

(e) For procurements of multiple contracts for job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, include either:

(i) A requirement that each person or firm submit a proposed subcontractor selection plan and a requirement that the proposed subcontractor selection plan must select subcontractors based on qualifications alone or on a combination of qualifications and price and shall not select subcontractors based on price alone.

(ii) A subcontractor selection plan adopted by the purchasing agency that applies to the person or firm that is selected to perform the job-order-contracting construction services and that requires subcontractors to be selected based on qualifications alone or on a combination of qualifications and price and not based on price alone and a requirement that each person or firm must submit a description of the procedures it proposes to use to implement the purchasing agency's subcontractor selection plan.

(f) Include a description of the publicly available location of the purchasing agency's protest policy and procedures or, if the purchasing agency does not have a protest policy and procedures, a statement that the protest policy and procedures referred to in subsection J of this section apply to any protests in connection with the procurement.

3. The director or head of the purchasing agency shall initiate an appropriately qualified selection committee for each request for qualifications.  The director or head of the purchasing agency shall ensure that the selection committee members are competent to serve on the selection committee. Each selection committee must include one employee of the purchasing agency or a purchasing agency representative appointed by the purchasing agency.  The same selection committee shall function as to all of the multiple contracts included in the procurement.  If the purchasing agency is procuring multiple contracts for professional services, the purchasing agency shall determine the number and qualifications of the selection committee members. A selection committee for the procurement of multiple contracts for job-order-contracting construction services shall have not more than seven members and shall include at least one person who is a senior management employee of a licensed contractor and one person who is an architect or engineer registered pursuant to section 32-121.  These members may be employees of the purchasing agency or outside consultants.  Outside contractors, architects and engineers serving on a selection committee are not entitled to receive compensation from the purchasing agency for performing this service, but the purchasing agency may elect to reimburse outside contractors, architects and engineers for travel, lodging and other expenses incurred in connection with service on a selection committee.  A person who is a member of a selection committee shall not be a contractor under a contract awarded under the procurement or provide any professional services, construction, construction services, materials or other services under the contract.  The selection committee and the purchasing agency shall do the following:

(a) If interviews are specified in the request for qualifications:

(i) The selection committee shall determine the persons or firms to be interviewed by evaluating the statements of qualifications and performance data that are submitted in response to the purchasing agency's request for qualifications based only on the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria stated in the request for qualifications to be used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.

(ii) If the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used by the selection committee to select the persons or firms on a final list and to determine their order on a final list are not included in the request for qualifications, before the interviews are held the purchasing agency shall distribute to the persons or firms to be interviewed the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used to select the persons or firms on each final list and to determine their order on each final list.  These selection criteria and relative weight may be different than the selection criteria and relative weight used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.

(iii) The selection committee shall conduct interviews with the number of persons or firms to be interviewed as stated in the request for qualifications regarding the professional services or job-order-contracting construction services and the relative methods of approach for furnishing the required professional services or job-order-contracting construction services.

(b) Based only on the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria specified as provided in this subsection for selection of the persons or firms on each final list and their order on each final list, the selection committee shall select the persons or firms for each final list and in the case of a final list or final lists for multiple contracts that will be negotiated under subsection E of this section, rank the persons or firms on each final list in order of preference.  If the procurement is for multiple contracts for different professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, there is a separate final list for each type of professional services, and if a person or firm submitted qualifications for more than one type of professional services, the person or firm may be on more than one final list.

(c) If the contract will be awarded under subsection E of this section, before or at the same time as the purchasing agency notifies the persons or firms on each final list that they are on that final list, the purchasing agency shall send actual notice to the following persons or firms that they are not on that final list:

(i) If interviews were held, the other persons and firms interviewed for that final list.

(ii) If interviews were not held, the other persons and firms that made submittals for that final list.

(d) If the contract will be awarded under subsection F of this section, before or at the same time as the purchasing agency notifies the persons or firms on the final list that they are on the final list, the purchasing agency shall send actual notice to each of the following persons or firms that they are not on the final list or that other persons or firms are on the final list:

(i) If interviews were held, the other persons or firms interviewed.

(ii) If interviews were not held, the other persons or firms that made submittals.

D. The purchasing agency shall award multiple contracts specified in the request for qualifications as provided in subsection E or F of this section.

E. The procurement officer shall conduct negotiations with persons or firms on the final list or final lists. The negotiations shall include consideration of compensation and other contract terms that the procurement officer determines to be fair and reasonable to this state.  In making this decision, the procurement officer shall take into account the estimated value, the scope, the complexity and the nature of the professional services or job-order-contracting construction services to be rendered. If in a procurement under this section the procurement officer terminates negotiations with a person or firm on a final list and commences negotiations with another person or firm on that final list, the procurement officer shall not in that procurement recommence negotiations or enter into a contract for the job-order-contracting construction services or professional services covered by that final list with any person or firm on that final list with whom the procurement officer has terminated negotiations.  If the procurement is for:

1. Multiple contracts for professional services to be awarded to a single person or firm, there is one final list and the procurement officer shall enter into negotiations with the highest qualified person or firm on the final list. If the procurement officer is not able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the highest qualified person or firm on the final list, at compensation and on other contract terms the procurement officer determines to be fair and reasonable, the procurement officer shall then undertake negotiations with the next most qualified person or firm on the final list in sequence until an agreement is reached or a determination is made to reject all persons or firms on the final list.

2. Multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms or for multiple contracts for similar professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, there is one final list and the procurement officer shall enter into separate negotiations for contracts with the number of the highest qualified persons or firms on the final list equal to the number of contracts to be awarded.  If the procurement officer is not able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with a person or firm with whom the procurement officer has commenced negotiations, the procurement officer shall formally terminate negotiations with that person or firm. The procurement officer shall then undertake negotiations for a contract with the next most qualified person or firm on the final list with whom the procurement officer is not then negotiating and with whom the procurement officer has not previously negotiated in sequence until an agreement is reached for some or all of the multiple contracts included in the request for qualifications or a determination is made to reject all persons or firms on the final list.

3. Multiple contracts for different professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, there is a separate final list for each type of professional services and the procurement officer shall enter into separate negotiations for contracts with the number of the highest qualified persons or firms on the final list equal to the number of contracts to be awarded.  If the procurement officer is not able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with a person or firm with whom the procurement officer has commenced negotiations, the procurement officer shall formally terminate negotiations with that person or firm.  The procurement officer shall then undertake negotiations for a contract with the next most qualified person or firm on the final list with whom the procurement officer is not then negotiating and with whom the procurement officer has not previously negotiated in sequence until an agreement is reached for some or all of the multiple contracts included in the request for qualifications or a determination is made to reject all persons or firms on the final list.

F. As an alternative to subsection E of this section, the purchasing agency may award multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms as follows:

1. The purchasing agency shall use the selection committee appointed for the request for qualifications pursuant to subsection C of this section.

(e) A statement that in applying the scoring method the selection committee will separately evaluate the technical proposal and the price proposal and will evaluate and score the technical proposal before opening the price proposal.

(f) If the purchasing agency conducts discussions pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection, a statement that discussions will be held and a requirement that each offeror submit a preliminary technical proposal before the discussions are held.

4. If the purchasing agency determines to conduct discussions pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection, each offeror shall submit a preliminary technical proposal to the purchasing agency before those discussions are held.

5. If determined by the purchasing agency and included by the purchasing agency in the request for proposals, the selection committee shall conduct discussions with all offerors that submit preliminary technical proposals.  Discussions shall be for the purpose of clarification to ensure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and for clarification by the purchasing agency. Revision of preliminary technical proposals shall be allowed after submission of preliminary technical proposals and before award for the purpose of obtaining best and final proposals.  In conducting any discussions, information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors shall not be disclosed to other competing offerors.

9. The purchasing agency shall award the multiple contracts to the responsive and responsible offerors whose proposals receive the highest scores under the method of scoring in the request for proposals. No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation.  Before or at the same time as the purchasing agency notifies the winning offerors that they have won, the purchasing agency shall give actual notice to each other offeror either that the offeror has not won or that other offerors have won.

10. The contracts file shall contain the basis on which the award is made, including at a minimum the information and documents required under subsection G of this section.

After each final list is selected pursuant to subsection B, the procurement officer shall enter into negotiations with the highest qualified person or firm on each final list or, in the case of a single final list for multiple contracts for the same professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, the purchasing agency shall enter into negotiations with a number of the highest qualified persons or firms on the final list equal to the number of contracts that may or will be awarded.  The negotiations shall include consideration of compensation and other contract terms that the procurement officer determines to be fair and reasonable to this state.  In making this determination, the procurement officer shall take into account the estimated value, the scope, the complexity and the nature of the professional services to be rendered. If the procurement officer is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with a person or firm with which the purchasing agency is negotiating at a price and on other contract terms the procurement officer determines to be fair and reasonable to this state, the procurement officer shall formally terminate negotiations with that person or firm.  The procurement officer may undertake negotiations with the next most qualified person or firm on the final list in sequence until an agreement is reached or a determination is made to reject all persons or firms on the final list.  If the procurement officer terminates negotiations with a person or firm on a final list and commences negotiations with another person or firm on the final list, the procurement officer shall not in that procurement recommence negotiations or enter into the single contract or multiple contracts for the professional services covered by that final list with any person or firm on that final list with whom the procurement officer has terminated negotiations.

D. If the purchasing agency does not have a procurement protest policy and procedures that have been formally adopted and published by the purchasing agency, for protests relating to procurements under this section the purchasing agency shall follow the procurement protest policy and procedures of the department.

## Chapter 27 - LEGISLATIVE REVIEW OF AGENCIES AND EXPIRATION OF NEW PROGRAMS

### Article 1 - Legislative Review of Agencies

#### Section 41-2951. Purpose

A. The Arizona legislature finds that state government actions have caused an increase in the number of agencies, departments, boards, commissions, institutions and programs of this state and that the process has developed without sufficient legislative oversight. Furthermore, the legislature finds that state government should be continually reviewed and revised in response to the developing needs of the public. In addition, the legislature finds that programs are perpetuated without periodic and systematic reappraisal of their achievements as compared to their original objectives. The legislature concludes that by establishing a system for the termination, study, review, continuation or reestablishment of such agencies, it will be in a better position to evaluate the need for the continued existence of current and future agencies, departments, boards, commissions, institutions and programs of this state.

B. It is the intention of the legislature:

1. To establish an orderly schedule for the termination of existing state agencies, departments, boards, commissions, institutions and programs and to make provisions for legislative review to enable the legislature to have the benefit of recommendations for the continuation of those state agencies, departments, boards, commissions, institutions and programs which are deemed to be essential for the necessary and efficient operation of government.

2. That the sunset review of an existing state agency, department, program, board or advisory council or committee means the sunset review of the powers and duties exercised by such state agency, department, program, board or advisory council or committee.

3. That any amendment of the enabling authority for an agency, department, program, board or advisory council or committee subject to sunset review be in accordance with this chapter.

#### Section 41-2952. Definitions

In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Agency" means any department, office, agency, commission, board or other instrumentality of this state specified in article 2 of this chapter regardless of whether monies are appropriated to such board.

2. "Committee" means the joint legislative audit committee.

3. "Committee of reference" means the appropriate standing committee of the house of representatives or senate that is appointed for the purpose of evaluating agencies subject to termination pursuant to this chapter.

4. "Special performance audit" means a performance audit of limited scope.

5. "Sunset review" means a systematic evaluation by the committee of reference under the supervision of the joint legislative audit committee, with the assistance of the appropriate agency, joint legislative budget committee, committees of reference, auditor general and support staff, to determine if the merits of the program justify its continuation rather than termination, or its continuation at a level less than or greater than the existing level. Such review shall be undertaken in the scope and detail the committee of reference deems appropriate and shall include, without limitation, whether there is a need for the program in state government and, if so, an assessment of the degree to which the original objectives of the program have been achieved expressed in terms of the performance, impact or accomplishments of the program and of the situation it was intended to address. Such review shall be coordinated with the performance audit procedures of the auditor general as set forth in chapter 7, article 10.1 of this title or of the committees of reference, whichever is appropriate.

6. "Terminate" or "termination" means the date provided for termination of legislative authority for the existence of a particular agency pursuant to article 2 of this chapter.

#### Section 41-2953. Joint legislative audit committee sunset powers and duties; report by auditor general and committees of reference; sunset review reports; performance audits

A. The joint legislative audit committee shall designate the chairman of each committee of reference and shall assign agencies to the respective committees of reference according to subject matter for performance review.

B. The auditor general shall provide to the committee a list of agencies scheduled for termination in the next sunset termination schedule, plus an estimate of the audit hours necessary to conduct a sunset review of each agency, not less than twenty months prior to the termination date for such agencies. Not less than nineteen months prior to such termination date, the committee shall meet to review the information submitted by the auditor general, shall select which agencies are subject to sunset review by the auditor general and which agencies are subject to sunset review by the committees of reference and shall determine the priority of review by the auditor general or the committees of reference. If the auditor general or the committees of reference are unable to complete the sunset review of a selected agency, the committee shall oversee the preparation of proposed legislation to place such agency in the following sunset termination schedule and is responsible for the introduction of such legislation. Those agencies not selected for sunset review by the committee shall terminate pursuant to article 2 of this chapter unless otherwise continued by the legislature.

C. The committee shall initiate the sunset review not less than seventeen months prior to the termination date for each agency which is selected pursuant to subsection B of this section and scheduled for termination pursuant to article 2 of this chapter. The draft sunset review report shall be completed not less than eleven months prior to the date established by article 2 of this chapter for termination. Before such report is submitted, the state agency affected shall be given an opportunity to review the draft report and submit written comments or rebuttal which shall be included in the preliminary sunset review report. The agency shall have not more than forty calendar days to review the draft report for comment or rebuttal. The preliminary sunset review report shall be submitted to the governor, to each member of the committee, to the committee of reference and to the affected agency by October 1 of the year prior to the scheduled termination date of the agency.

D. The committee may direct the auditor general or the committees of reference to conduct a performance audit, as defined in chapter 7, article 10.1 of this title, or a special performance audit of any agency as defined in section 41-2952.

E. If an agency is continued, the joint legislative audit committee may direct the auditor general or the committees of reference to conduct a follow-up review of the agency to determine how the agency has performed its statutory functions or corrected deficiencies of prior sunset review, or both.

The agency involved shall prepare a presentation for the first public meeting that addresses the elements of the written statement required by subsection G of this section.

C. Each committee of reference shall hold public hearings for the following purposes:

1. To determine the actual need of the agency to regulate or direct the particular activity.

5. The extent to which the agency has encouraged input from the public before adopting its rules and the extent to which it has informed the public as to its actions and the expected impact on the public.

13. The extent to which the agency potentially creates unexpected negative consequences that might require additional review by the committee of reference, including increasing the price of goods, affecting the availability of services, limiting the abilities of individuals and businesses to operate efficiently and increasing the cost of government.

E. Each committee of reference that reviews an agency that administers an occupational regulation as defined in section 41-3501 shall consider but not be limited to the following factors in determining the need for continuation or termination of each agency:

2. A statement, to the extent practicable, in quantitative and qualitative terms, of the objectives of such agency and its anticipated accomplishments.

3. An identification of any other agencies having similar, conflicting or duplicate objectives, and an explanation of the manner in which the agency avoids duplication or conflict with other such agencies.

G. An application for a new qualifying party shall include the completion of the prescribed forms, fingerprints and testing, if applicable, in accordance with sections 41-4025 and 41-4026.

In the absence of any disciplinary proceeding or disciplinary suspension and on payment of reasonable fees determined by the board the director may issue an inactive license certificate to the licensee if the licensee has turned in his license. The inactive license certificate may consist of an endorsement on the licensee's license stating that the license is inactive. The director may not refund any of the license renewal fee which a licensee paid before requesting inactive status. A licensee's license that is not suspended or revoked and is inactive shall be reactivated as an active license on payment of the current year's renewal fee and thirty days' written notice to the director.  An examination may not be required to reactivate an inactive license. If the license is not reactivated within two years, a new application for licensing must be made and the new license issued pursuant to this chapter.  A licensee may not inactivate the license more than once. The holder of an inactive license shall not work as a licensee until the licensee's license is reactivated as an active license. The inactive status of a licensee's license does not bar any disciplinary action by the director against a licensee for any of the grounds stated in this chapter.

1. Any consumer of a unit regulated by this chapter who enters into an agreement with any licensee, except a salesperson or broker of manufactured homes or mobile homes, and who is damaged by the failure of the principal to perform a sales or installation agreement or to perform repairs under a warranty.

2. The director, if the principal fails to pay any of the fees or costs that the principal owes the department.

E. Any person claiming against the bond or deposit, except the department, may maintain an action against the principal and the surety.  The principal's bond or deposit may be sued on in successive actions until the full amount is exhausted.  A suit may not be commenced on the bond or deposit after the expiration of two years after the date of sale or installation of the unit, whichever is later, on which the suit is based, except that the time for purposes of the claim for fraud shall be measured pursuant to section 12-543.

F. The surety bond or deposit shall be continuous in form and shall contain the condition that the total aggregate liability of the surety or depository for all claims shall be limited to the face amount of the bond or depository irrespective of the number of years the bond or depository is in force.  If the corporate surety desires to make payment without awaiting court action, the amount of the bond filed shall be reduced to the extent of any payment or payments made by the corporate surety in good faith. Any such payments shall be based on priority of written claims received by the corporate surety before court action.  The surety bond or depository shall be continuous as long as the corporate surety or the depositor maintains the face amount of the bond or deposit.  Failure to maintain the face amount of the bond or deposit constitutes a suspension of the license until the face amount of the bond or deposit is restored.

G. The corporate surety shall notify the director of the intent of the principal to cancel the bond and of any monies paid from the bond.  On receipt by the director of notice to cancel a bond by any corporate surety, the director shall immediately notify the licensee who is the principal on the bond of the effective date of cancellation of the bond and that the licensee shall furnish a like bond or make cash deposit on or before the effective date of cancellation or the license shall be suspended. Notice to the licensee shall be by certified mail postage fully prepaid, addressed to the licensee's last address of record with the department. The license shall be suspended on the date the bond is canceled unless a replacement bond or cash deposit in lieu of a bond is on file with the director.

H. The director shall have no personal liability for the performance of duties relating to the bond and cash deposit requirements of this section if such duties are performed in good faith.

### Article 5 - New School Facilities

#### Section 41-5741. New school facilities fund; capital plan; reporting requirements

A. The new school facilities fund is established consisting of monies appropriated by the legislature and monies credited to the new school facilities fund pursuant to section 37-221. The division shall administer the new school facilities fund and, at the direction of the school facilities oversight board, shall distribute monies, as a continuing appropriation, to school districts for the purpose of constructing new school facilities and for contracted expenses pursuant to section 41-5702, subsection B, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4.

B. The school facilities oversight board shall prescribe a uniform format for use by the school district governing board in developing and annually updating a capital plan that consists of each of the following:

1. Enrollment projections for the next five years for elementary schools and eight years for middle and high schools, including a description of the methods used to make the projections.

2. A description of new schools or additions to existing schools needed to meet the building adequacy standards prescribed in section  41-5711. The description shall include:

(a) The grade levels and the total number of pupils that the school or addition is intended to serve.

(b) The year in which it is necessary for the school or addition to begin operations.

(c) A timeline that shows the planning and construction process for the school or addition.

3. Long-term projections of the need for land for new schools.

4. Any other necessary information required by the school facilities oversight board to evaluate a school district's capital plan.

5. If a school district pays tuition for all or a portion of the school district's high school pupils to another school district, the capital plan shall indicate the number of pupils for which the district pays tuition to another district. If a school district accepts pupils from another school district pursuant to section 15-824, subsection A, the school district shall indicate the projections for this population separately. This paragraph does not apply to a small isolated school district as defined in section 15-901.

C. If the capital plan indicates a need for a new school or an addition to an existing school within the next four years or a need for land within the next ten years, the school district shall submit its plan to the school facilities oversight board on or before September 1 and shall request monies from the new school facilities fund for the new construction or land. The board may require a school district to sell land that was previously purchased entirely with monies provided by the board if the board determines that the property is no longer needed within the ten-year period specified in this subsection for a new school or no longer needed within that ten-year period for an addition to an existing school. Monies provided for land are in addition to any monies provided pursuant to subsection D of this section.

D. At the direction of the board, the division shall distribute monies from the new school facilities fund for additional square footage as follows:

1. The board shall review and evaluate the enrollment projections. On or before December 15 of each year, following the submission of the enrollment projections, the board shall either approve the projections as submitted or revise the projections. In approving or revising the enrollment projections, the board shall use the average daily membership data available during the current school year. On request from the board, the department of education shall make available the most recent average daily membership data for use in revising the enrollment projections. In determining new construction requirements, the board shall determine the net new growth of pupils that will require additional square footage that exceeds the building adequacy standards prescribed in section 41-5711. If the projected growth and the existing number of pupils exceed three hundred fifty pupils who are served in a school district other than the pupil's resident school district, the board, the receiving school district and the resident school district shall develop a capital facilities plan on how to best serve those pupils. A small isolated school district as defined in section 15-901 is not required to develop a capital facilities plan pursuant to this paragraph.

2. If the average daily membership projections indicate that additional space will not be needed within the next two school years in order to meet the building adequacy standards prescribed in section 41-5711, the request shall be held for consideration by the board for possible future funding and the school district shall annually submit an updated plan until the additional space is needed.

3. If the average daily membership projections indicate that additional space will be needed within the next two school years in order to meet the building adequacy standards prescribed in section 41-5711, the board shall provide an amount as follows:

(a) Determine the number of pupils requiring additional square footage to meet building adequacy standards. This amount for elementary schools shall not be less than the number of new pupils for whom space will be needed in the next year and shall not exceed the number of new pupils for whom space will be needed in the next five years. This amount for middle and high schools shall not be less than the number of new pupils for whom space will be needed in the next four years and shall not exceed the number of new pupils for whom space will be needed in the next eight years.

(b) Multiply the number of pupils determined in subdivision (a) of this paragraph by the square footage per pupil. The square footage per pupil is ninety square feet per pupil for preschool children with disabilities, kindergarten programs and grades one through six, one hundred square feet for grades seven and eight, one hundred thirty-four square feet for a school district that provides instruction in grades nine through twelve for fewer than one thousand eight hundred pupils and one hundred twenty-five square feet for a school district that provides instruction in grades nine through twelve for at least one thousand eight hundred pupils. The total number of pupils in grades nine through twelve in the district shall determine the square footage factor to use for net new pupils. The board may modify the square footage requirements prescribed in this subdivision for particular schools based on any of the following factors:

(i) The number of pupils served or projected to be served by the school district.

(ii) Geographic factors.

(iii) Grade configurations other than those prescribed in this subdivision.

(iv) Compliance with minimum school facility adequacy requirements established pursuant to section 41-5711.

(c) Multiply the product obtained in subdivision (b) of this paragraph by the cost per square foot. The cost per square foot is $270.24 for preschool children with disabilities, kindergarten programs and grades one through six, $285.30 for grades seven and eight and $330.30 for grades nine through twelve. The cost per square foot shall be adjusted annually for construction market considerations based on an index identified or developed by the joint legislative budget committee as necessary but not less than once each year. Each annual construction market adjustment applies to all projects approved by the school facilities board under this subsection during that year. The board shall multiply the cost per square foot by 1.05 for any school district located in a rural area. The board may only modify the base cost per square foot prescribed in this subdivision for particular schools based on geographic conditions or site conditions. Any extra monies received as a result of a modification based on geographic conditions or site conditions may be used to address unforeseen costs at any stage of a project under this section. For the purposes of this subdivision, "rural area" means an area outside a thirty-five-mile radius of a boundary of a municipality with a population of more than fifty thousand persons.

(d) Once the school district governing board obtains approval from the board for new facility construction monies, additional portable or modular square footage created for the express purpose of providing temporary space for pupils until the completion of the new facility and any additional space funded by the school district shall not be included by the board for the purpose of new construction funding calculations. On completion of the new facility construction project, any additional space funded by the school district shall be included as prescribed by this chapter and, if the portable or modular facilities continue in use, the portable or modular facilities shall be included as prescribed by this chapter, unless the board approves their continued use for the purpose of providing temporary space for pupils until the completion of the next new facility that has been approved for funding from the new school facilities fund.

4.

When the school district qualifies for a distribution of monies from the new school facilities fund according to this section, the board shall direct the division to distribute monies to the school district from the new school facilities fund for the square footage constructed under section 15-342, paragraph 33 at the same cost per square foot established by this section that was in effect at the time of the beginning of the construction of the school facility. Before the board directs the division to distribute any monies pursuant to this subsection, the school district shall demonstrate to the board that the facilities to be funded pursuant to this section meet the minimum adequacy standards prescribed in section 41-5711.
