The bond amount may be increased or decreased as necessary based on any reason listed in subsection D of this section or a change in the applicant's previous filing period, filing compliance record or payment history. If the bond amount is increased above the amount computed under this subsection, the applicant may request a hearing pursuant to subsection C of this section to show why the order increasing the bond amount is in error.

The determination is final unless within fifteen days after the giving of notice of the determination the person appeals the determination to the state board of tax appeals. The board shall decide on the appeal within fifteen days of its receipt. The bond, at any time without notice, may be applied to any tax, penalties or interest due, and for that purpose the securities may be sold at public or private sale without notice to the depositor.

1. After investigation of financial status, the department determines that an applicant for a new license would be unable to timely remit amounts due.

2. An applicant for a new license held a license for a prior business, and the remittance record for the prior business falls within one of the conditions in paragraph 5 of this subsection.

On issuing an injunction, the court may also order the sheriff to seal the taxpayer's business premises and may allow the taxpayer access to the premises only on the approval of the court.

C. On application for an injunction against a person other than a delinquent taxpayer, the court may issue an order temporarily restraining the person from engaging or continuing in business. The court shall hear the matter within three days and on a showing that the person has been given notice of the hearing as required by law, that demand has been made on the taxpayer to furnish security, that the taxpayer has not furnished security and that the director considers the collection from the primarily responsible person of the total amount of tax due or reasonably expected to become due to be in jeopardy, the court may forthwith enjoin the person from engaging or continuing in business until the person complies in full with the demand of the director for furnishing security.

D. The court shall not issue a temporary restraining order or injunction under this section against any person who has furnished security pursuant to section 42-1102, 42-5006 or 42-5007.

B. The department may impose a civil penalty of one thousand dollars against a return preparer who wilfully made an understatement of liability on a return or claim for refund.

C. A return preparer is required to only pay eighty-five per cent of the imposed penalty if the payment is made within thirty days from the date of the receipt of notification that the penalty was imposed.  A return preparer may not appeal to the department pursuant to section 42-1251 if the return preparer fails to file the appeal within thirty days from the date of the receipt of notification that the penalty was imposed.

A determination made by the tax court under this subsection is final except as provided in section 12-170, subsection C.

C. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section and subsection B, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section, a taxpayer who has a duty to collect use tax shall not be assessed tax pursuant to chapter 5, article 4 of this title for any retail sales to purchasers who were licensed pursuant to section 42-5005 or registered pursuant to section 42-5154 and who filed use tax returns for the reporting period in which the sale was made, if the reporting period in which the sale was made is more than four years from the notice of proposed deficiency. If, before this time limitation expires, the taxpayer consents in writing to an assessment after that time for the transactions, a subsequent assessment may include any transaction within the agreed extended period. The period agreed to may be extended by subsequent written agreements made before the period previously agreed to expires.

#### Section 42-1105. Taxpayer identification, verification and records; retention

A. The federal taxpayer identification number, assigned pursuant to section 6109 of the internal revenue code, is the taxpayer identifier for purposes of the taxes administered pursuant to this article. Each person who is required to make a return, statement or other document shall include the identifier in order to secure the person's proper identification. If the return, statement or other document is made, electronically or otherwise, by another person on behalf of the taxpayer, the taxpayer shall furnish the identifier to the other person, and the person shall furnish both the taxpayer's identifier and the person's own identifier with the return, statement or document.

B. The department may prescribe by administrative rule alternative methods for signing, subscribing or verifying a return, statement or other document required or authorized to be filed with the department that have the same validity and consequence as the actual signature or written declaration of the taxpayer or other person required to sign, subscribe or verify the return, statement or other document.  While the department is adopting a rule prescribing alternative methods for signing, subscribing or verifying a return, statement or other document, the director, by tax ruling, may waive the requirement of a signature for a particular type or class of return, statement or other document required to be filed with the department. This subsection does not apply if the alternative method for signing a return, statement or other document is an electronic signature. The department shall accept or require electronic signatures in the manner prescribed in section 42-1131. For purposes of this subsection, "tax ruling" has the same meaning prescribed in section 42-2052.

C. A person who is a return preparer or an electronic return preparer shall furnish a completed copy of the return, statement or other document to the taxpayer no later than the time the return, statement or other document is presented for the taxpayer's signature.

D. Except as provided in section 42-3010, every person who is subject to the taxes administered pursuant to this article shall keep and preserve copies of filed tax returns, including any attachments to the tax return, any signature documents used for the tax return, suitable records and other books and accounts necessary to determine the tax for which the person is liable for the period prescribed in section 42-1104.  The books, records and accounts shall be open for inspection at any reasonable time by the department or its authorized agent.

E. Except as provided in section 42-3010, a return preparer or electronic return preparer shall keep copies of the return, statement or other document for six years for transaction privilege and use tax returns and four years for all other returns, statements and other documents following the date on which the return, statement or other document was due to be filed or was presented to the taxpayer for signature, whichever is later.

F. Except as provided in section 42-3010, the department may require by administrative rule electronic return preparers to keep for each prepared return, statement or other document the following documents for six years for transaction privilege and use tax returns and four years for all other returns, statements and other documents following the later of either the date on which the return, statement or other document was due to be filed with the department or was presented to the taxpayer for signature:

1. The signature document or tax return form bearing the taxpayer's original signature in a manner prescribed by the department by administrative rule or tax ruling.

2. Any attachments to the return, statement or other document required to be submitted to the department if the return, statement or other document had not been electronically transmitted to the department.

G. The operator of a swap meet, flea market, fair, carnival, festival, circus or other transient selling event shall maintain a current list of vendors conducting business on the premises as sellers.  The list shall include each vendor name, business name and business address.  On written notice, the department may require an operator to submit a copy of the list at any time to the department.

H. For at least the period of time prescribed by section 42-1104, the department shall retain any return, statement or other document as a record pursuant to sections 41-151.14, 41-151.15, 41-151.16, 41-151.17 and 41-151.19. Anything submitted with the return, statement or other document that is not required, authorized or requested by the department is not part of the record and may be destroyed, unless it is, at the department's reasonable discretion, of more than de minimis value.  Copies of original documents of which the department reasonably expects the taxpayer has retained any originals are presumed to be of de minimis value for purposes of this section. If the department determines that any document that is not required, authorized or requested by the department pursuant to this subsection is of more than de minimis value, within ten days after receipt the department shall notify the taxpayer in writing or by electronic means of its intent to destroy the document. If the taxpayer requests the return of any document included in the notice, the department shall immediately comply, although the director may require the taxpayer to pay any shipping costs to return the document. If the taxpayer does not request the return of the documents within thirty days after the date on the notice or the taxpayer consents to the destruction of the documents, whichever occurs first, the department may destroy the documents included in the notice.

#### Section 42-1105.01. Signatures; return preparers and electronic return preparers; definition

Any person who is a return preparer or an electronic return preparer shall sign the prepared return, statement or other document according to the department’s administrative rules or tax rulings.  For the purposes of this section, "tax ruling" has the same meaning prescribed in section 42-2052.

#### Section 42-1105.02. Date of filing by electronic means; definitions

A. Any return, statement or other document that is electronically filed pursuant to an electronic filing program established by the department shall be deemed filed and received by the department on the date of the electronic postmark.  If the taxpayer and the electronic return preparer or the electronic return transmitter are in different time zones, it is the taxpayer's time zone, as determined by the taxpayer’s address, that controls the timeliness of the electronically filed return, statement or other document.  When a return, statement or other document has been electronically received on the host system of more than one electronic return preparer or electronic return transmitter during its ultimate transmission to the department, the return, statement or other document shall be deemed filed and received by the department on the date of the earliest electronic postmark.

B. Any return, statement or other document that is filed under subsection A of this section and that is not received by the department shall be deemed filed and received on the date of the electronic filing, as evidenced by the electronic postmark if the sender:

1. Establishes the date of the electronic filing.

2. Files a duplicate filing with the department within ten days after the department notifies the sender in writing of the nonreceipt of the filing.

C. If the due date of any return, statement or other document filed under subsection A of this section falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the filing shall be considered timely if it is performed on the next business day.

D. In this section, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Electronic filing program" means any program established by the department that authorizes the electronic filing of a return, statement or other document.

2. "Electronic postmark" means a record of the date and time in a particular time zone that the return, statement or other document is electronically received on the host system of the electronic return preparer or electronic return transmitter that participates in the transmission of the electronic return, statement or other document to the department.

#### Section 42-1105.03. Unauthorized disclosure; violation; classification

A return preparer, electronic return preparer or electronic return transmitter is guilty of a class 3 misdemeanor if the preparer or transmitter knowingly or recklessly discloses information related to a return, statement or other document to another person who is not authorized to receive that information under this title or title 43.

#### Section 42-1106. Time limitations for credit and refund claims

A. The period within which a claim for credit or refund may be filed, or credit or refund may be allowed or made if no claim is filed, is the period within which the department may make an assessment under section 42-1104.

B. If the total amount withheld under section 43-401 exceeds the amount of the tax on the employee's entire taxable income as computed under title 43, no refund, credit or offset may be made to the employee unless the employee files a return, in respect of which the tax withheld might be credited, within four years from the due date of the original return.

C. If a refund or credit of any overpayment of tax resulting from the amendments made to section 121(d)(9) of the internal revenue code by the military family tax relief act of 2003 (P.L. 108-121) is prevented by the operation of any law or rule of law, including res judicata, at any time before the close of the one year period beginning on November 11, 2003, the refund or credit may nevertheless be made or allowed if the claim is filed before the close of this period.

D. The failure to begin an action for refund or credit within the time specified in this section is a bar against the recovery of taxes by the taxpayer.

#### Section 42-1107. Extension of time for filing returns

A. The department, pursuant to administrative rule, may grant an automatic extension of time for filing an income tax return under title 43 if at least ninety percent of the tax liability disclosed by the taxpayer's return for the reporting period is paid and if the request for extension is received or mailed on or before the date the return is otherwise due to be filed.  If at least ninety percent of the tax liability disclosed by the taxpayer's return for the reporting period has not been paid at the time of filing for the extension, the taxpayer is subject to a penalty of one-half of one percent of the tax not paid for each thirty-day period or fraction of a thirty-day period elapsing between the date the return is otherwise due to be filed and the date the tax is paid, not to exceed a total of twenty-five percent. If a taxpayer is subject to both of the penalties prescribed under this section and section 42-1125, the maximum combined penalty that may be imposed on the taxpayer under both sections shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the tax found to be remaining due. A taxpayer is not subject to the penalties prescribed under section 42-1125, subsection D if the taxpayer is subject to the penalties prescribed under this section. If in its judgment good cause exists, the department may grant a further extension or extensions of time for filing the return pursuant to administrative rule. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, an extension or extensions granted under this subsection may not aggregate more than six months after the due date provided for the filing of returns.

B. If the taxpayer has been granted an extension or extensions of time within which to file a federal income tax return for any taxable year, the taxpayer is deemed to have been granted the same extension of time for filing the Arizona income tax return if the taxpayer has paid at least ninety percent of the tax liability disclosed by the taxpayer's return for the reporting period. If at the time the taxpayer has been granted a federal extension or extensions the taxpayer is required to pay at least ninety percent under this section, the payment shall be in a manner prescribed by the department.

C. The department, for good cause, may extend the time for making any other return required by chapter 5, articles 1, 4 and 5 of this title, and may grant such reasonable additional time in which to make the return as it deems proper, but the time for filing the return shall not be extended beyond the first day of the third month next succeeding the regular due date of the return.

D. The due date for an income tax return for a taxpayer filing a corporate or exempt organization return that has been granted an extension or extensions pursuant to subsection A or B of this section is seven months after the initial due date provided for filing returns. This subsection does not include small business corporation returns filed under section 43-1126.

#### Section 42-1108. Audit; deficiency assessments; nonaudit adjustments; electronic filing

A. If a taxpayer fails to file a return required by this title or title 43, or if the department is not satisfied with the return or payment of the amount of tax required to be paid under either title, the department may examine any return, including any books, papers, records or memoranda relating to the return, to determine the correct amount of tax.  This examination must occur within the time periods prescribed by section 42-1104 and may be accomplished through a detailed review of transactions or records or by a statistically valid sampling method.

B. The department shall give the taxpayer notice of its determination of a deficiency by mail or as prescribed by subsection C of this section, and the deficiency, plus penalties and interest, is final forty-five days after the date of receipt of the notice to the taxpayer unless an appeal is taken to the department. For individual income tax, the period is ninety days after the date of mailing.  In the case of a joint income tax return, the notice may be a single joint notice mailed to the last known address, but if either spouse notifies the department that separate residences have been established, the department shall mail duplicate originals of the joint notice to each spouse.

C. The department may issue notice of its determination of a deficiency under subsection B of this section by using an electronic portal in lieu of mail, if all of the requirements of this subsection are met, after December 31, 2018 or when the department establishes the electronic portal, whichever is later.  The use of the electronic portal in lieu of mail is subject to the following requirements and conditions:

1. The taxpayer agrees in writing to allow the department to use the electronic portal to issue notice of the department's determination of deficiency for specified tax periods. The agreement shall include an email address that the department may use to notify the taxpayer as required by paragraph 2 of this subsection.  A taxpayer that provides an email address is certifying that the taxpayer regularly monitors that email address. If the taxpayer's email address changes, the taxpayer shall notify the department of a new email address.

2. The department shall notify the taxpayer, using the taxpayer's e-mail address, on the same day the notice of its determination of a deficiency is posted to the electronic portal.

3. The date of receipt for a notice provided by electronic portal is the later of the date the notice is posted to the electronic portal or the date the notification is received by the taxpayer. A notification sent by e-mail is considered to be received by the taxpayer on the day it is sent by the department.

D. If a deficiency is determined and the assessment becomes final, the department shall mail notice and demand to the taxpayer for the payment of the deficiency. Notwithstanding section 42-1125, subsection E, the deficiency assessed is due and payable at the expiration of ten days after the date of the notice and demand.

E. A certificate by the department of the mailing or e-mailing of the notices specified in this section is prima facie evidence of the assessment of the deficiency and the giving of the notices.

F. Any amount of tax in excess of that disclosed by the return due to a nonaudit adjustment, as listed in subsection G or H of this section, notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, is not a deficiency assessment within the meaning of this section. The taxpayer may not protest or appeal as in the case of a deficiency assessment, based on such a notice, and the assessment or collection of the amount of tax erroneously omitted in the return is not prohibited by this article.

G. An adjustment due to any of the following is considered a nonaudit adjustment:

1. An addition, subtraction, multiplication, division or other mathematical error shown on any return.

2. The failure of the taxpayer to properly compute the tax liability based on the taxable income reported on the return.

3. An incorrect usage or selection of information for a filed return from tax tables, schedules or similar documents provided by the department if the incorrect usage is apparent from the existence of other information on the return.

4. An entry on a return that is inconsistent with an entry on a schedule, form, statement, list or other document filed with the return.

5. An omission of information required on the return to substantiate an entry.

6. An entry on a return of a deduction or credit in an amount that exceeds a statutory limit if the limit is a monetary figure, a percentage, a ratio or a fraction and the items entered into the application of this limit appear on the return, including claiming a deduction or credit that is not authorized by statute for the taxable period.

7. Missing or incorrect taxpayer identification numbers for the purposes of claiming exemptions or credits.

8. An entry of a credit or deduction that requires a preapproval if the credit or deduction has not been preapproved or if the entry is for more than the preapproved amount.

9. An entry of a credit or deduction amount carried forward from a prior year that is outside of the statutory period allowed for the carryforward or is for an amount that is inconsistent with the taxpayer's prior year returns.

H. If a taxpayer that files its return electronically is allowed to input the information from a document into the electronic filing program instead of providing the actual document with the return, the department may request a copy of the document from the taxpayer at any time.  If the taxpayer provides the document, the department may adjust the return to reflect the amounts on the document.  If the taxpayer does not provide the requested document within the period provided by the department, the department may deny any deduction, credit or withholding that the document is intended to substantiate. An adjustment made pursuant to this subsection is considered a nonaudit adjustment under subsection G, paragraph 4 of this section, even though the actual document is not included with the electronically filed return if the department requests the document within sixty days after the due date of the return or the date on which the return was filed, whichever is later.

 

#### Section 42-1109. Failure to file return; false or fraudulent return; limited scope review; mandamus; order to produce documents; electronic portal

A. If a person who is required to file a report or return fails to do so within fifteen days after written demand by the department, the department shall proceed to obtain facts and information on which to base the tax, and for that purpose the department or its agent may examine the books, records and papers of the person and may take evidence on oath of any person who the department believes has facts or information pertinent to the inquiry. The director or the director's agent may administer the oath. As soon as the department procures the information, it shall hold a hearing to determine the amount of tax payable by the person. The department shall give at least ten days' notice in writing of the time and place of holding the hearing, which shall be mailed to the person's last known address or served personally. The levy of the tax is final after the hearing as to any person who fails or refuses to file a return.

B. If a taxpayer files a false or fraudulent return or fails or neglects to file a return within fifteen calendar days after written or electronic demand by the department, the department, at any time, may require a return or a supplementary return or may estimate the taxable income from any available information and may propose to assess the amount of tax, interest and penalties due. The provisions of this article relating to delinquent taxes apply to the tax, interest and penalties computed pursuant to this subsection. A proceeding in court to collect the tax, interest and penalties provided for in this subsection may be begun without assessment at any time.  Notwithstanding section 42-1004, subsection C, the assessment of tax, interest or penalties under this subsection does not preclude subsequent deficiency assessments under section 42-1108.

C. The department may conduct a limited scope review of a filed individual income tax return if it discovers a discrepancy between amounts reported on the return and the information the department receives pursuant to section 43-412.  In a notice to the taxpayer, the department may request records from a taxpayer in support of the taxpayer's filed returns and propose a tentative amount of tax, interest and penalties due on the basis of this additional information.  The taxpayer shall have at least thirty calendar days to respond to this notice on a form prescribed by the department. A limited scope review under this subsection may be conducted only once per taxable year per taxpayer and shall not be considered an initial audit contact for purposes of section 42-2075 if any of the following applies:

1. The taxpayer provides documentation or an explanation that resolves the discrepancy between the originally filed return and the information received pursuant to section 43-412.

2. The taxpayer files an amended return that corrects the discrepancy.

3. The department, at the taxpayer's request, adjusts the return filed by the taxpayer based on an agreed amount.  An adjustment made at the taxpayer's request under this paragraph is not considered an audit and does not preclude a future audit of the same year under section 42-1108.

4. The department notifies the taxpayer requesting the taxpayer to resolve the discrepancy by filing an amended return in order to avoid a possible future audit and reduce possible future penalties and interest. Any future audit shall be conducted pursuant to section 42-1108.

D. If an assessment is proposed under this section, the taxpayer has the right to protest the assessment, to have an oral hearing on the protest if requested and to appeal to the state board of tax appeals from the department's action on the protest. The taxpayer shall proceed under this section in the manner and within the time prescribed by article 6 of this chapter.

E. In addition to the remedies provided by subsection B of this section, if a taxpayer fails to file a return within sixty days after the time prescribed by this chapter, the department may petition the tax court to issue a writ of mandamus requiring the person to file a return. The petition shall be returnable not later than ten days after filing the petition. The petition shall be heard and determined on the return day or on such day thereafter as the court shall fix, having regard to the speediest possible determination of the case, consistent with the rights of the parties. The court shall provide at least ten days' written notice of the hearing to the taxpayer, which shall be mailed to the taxpayer's last known address or served on the taxpayer personally. The judgment shall include costs in favor of the prevailing party.  Proceedings on such suits shall comply with the rules of procedure for special actions.

F. If a person wilfully refuses to make available any books, papers or records for examination by the department, or wilfully refuses to attend and testify, in connection with any proceedings instituted under subsection A of this section, the department may apply to the tax court for an order directing that person to produce the books, papers or records or to compel the person's attendance and testimony. If the books, papers or records required by the department are in the custody of a corporation, the order of the court may be directed to any principal officer of the corporation or its registered statutory agent. The failure to obey such an order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt.

G. The department may issue notice of its determination of deficiency under subsection B of this section by using an electronic portal in lieu of mail if all of the following requirements are met:

1. The taxpayer agrees in writing to allow the department to use the electronic portal to issue notice of the department's determination of deficiency for specified tax periods.  The agreement shall include an email address that the department may use to notify the taxpayer as required by paragraph 2 of this subsection.  A taxpayer that provides an email address is certifying that the taxpayer regularly monitors that email address. If the taxpayer's email address changes, the taxpayer shall notify the department of a new email address.

2. The department notifies the taxpayer via the email address when the notice of the department's determination of deficiency is posted to the electronic portal.

3. The email notification under paragraph 2 of this subsection is sent on the same day the notice of the department's determination of deficiency is posted to the electronic portal.

4. The date of receipt for a notice of the department's determination of deficiency is the later of the date the notice is posted to the electronic portal or the date the taxpayer receives the email notification required under paragraph 3 of this subsection. An email notification is deemed received by the taxpayer on the day it is sent by the department.

#### Section 42-1110. Successor liability for tax

A. The taxes administered pursuant to this article except estate and income taxes are a lien on the property of any person subject to this article who sells his business or stock of goods, or quits business, if the person fails to make a final return and payment of the tax within fifteen days after selling or quitting his business.

B. A person's successors or assigns shall withhold from the purchase money an amount sufficient to cover the taxes required to be collected and interest or penalties due and payable until the former owner produces a receipt from the department showing that the department has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due as then shown by the records of the department. The department shall respond to a request from the seller for a certificate within fifteen days by either providing the certificate or a written notice stating why the certificate cannot be issued. If a subsequent audit shows a deficiency arising before the sale of the business, the deficiency is an obligation of the seller and does not constitute a liability against the buyer who has received a certificate from the department. If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to withhold sufficient purchase money as provided by this subsection, he is personally liable for payment of the amount of taxes required to be collected or paid by the former owner on account of the business so purchased, with interest and penalties accrued and unpaid by the former owner or assignors.

#### Section 42-1111. Jeopardy assessments

A. If the department believes that the collection of any assessment or deficiency of any tax administered pursuant to this article will be jeopardized by delay, whether or not the time otherwise prescribed by law for making a return and paying the tax has expired and notwithstanding other provisions of law, the department shall immediately mail, send electronically or issue notice of its finding and the information on which the finding is based to the taxpayer and demand immediate payment of the tax or deficiency declared to be in jeopardy, including interest, penalties and additions.

B. Jeopardy assessments are immediately due and payable, and the department may immediately begin proceedings for collection. The taxpayer, however, may stay collection and prevent the jeopardy assessment from becoming final by filing, within ten days after the date of mailing or delivery of the notice of jeopardy assessment, or within such additional time as the department may allow, a bond or other security in such amounts as the department may deem necessary, not exceeding the amount of the assessment including interest and penalties as to which the stay is desired. The taxpayer may proceed to appeal the assessment as provided in article 6 of this chapter.

C. If a bond or other security is not filed within the period prescribed by subsection B of this section, the department may treat the assessment as final for purposes of any collection proceedings. The taxpayer shall be afforded the appeal rights provided in article 6 of this chapter. The filing of a petition by the taxpayer under section 42-1251 does not stay the department's rights to pursue any collection proceedings.

D. In any proceeding brought to enforce payment of taxes made due and payable by this section:

1. The belief of the department under subsection A of this section, whether or not made after notice to the taxpayer, is for all purposes presumptive evidence that the assessment or collection of the tax or the deficiency was in jeopardy.

2. A certificate of the department of the mailing, electronic sending or issuing of the notice specified in this section is presumptive evidence that the notice was mailed, sent or issued.

E. The taxpayer may request an expedited review of the department's action pursuant to section 42-2061.

#### Section 42-1112. Enforcement powers and duties

In performing its duties pursuant to this article the department may:

1. Examine any books, papers, records or memoranda bearing on the matters required to be included in the return of any taxpayer.

2. Require from a taxpayer's consolidated return, filed under sections 1501 and 1502 of the United States internal revenue code copies of:

(a) The first page.

(b) Schedule J.

(c) The company balance sheets.

(b) Require material proof for its information.

(c) Administer oaths.

4. Issue subpoenas and subpoenas duces tecum, signed by the director or his designee, to be served on any person for the purposes of this section.

#### Section 42-1113. Closing agreements

The department or any person authorized in writing by the department may enter into a written agreement with a taxpayer relating to the liability of the taxpayer, or relating to the liability of the person or estate for whom he acts, in respect of any tax administered pursuant to this article for any taxable period. If an agreement is approved by the department within the time stated in the agreement, or later agreed to, it is final and conclusive, except on a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a material fact. The case shall not be reopened as to the matters agreed on or the agreement modified by any officer, employee or agent of this state. In any suit, action or proceeding, the agreement, or any determination, assessment, collection, payment, abatement, refund or credit made pursuant to the agreement, shall not be annulled, modified, set aside or disregarded.

#### Section 42-1114. Suit to recover taxes

A. The department may bring an action in the name of this state to recover the amount of any taxes, penalties, interest or other amounts owed by the taxpayer to the department that are due and unpaid. The department of law shall prosecute the action. In the action a writ of attachment may be issued and no bond or affidavit previous to issuing the attachment is required. In the action a certificate by the department of revenue showing the delinquency is prima facie evidence of the levy of the tax, of the delinquency and of the compliance by the department of revenue with all the provisions of law relating to the computation and levy of the tax.

B. The department of revenue may bring an appropriate action in any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or any foreign country in the name of this state to recover the amount of any taxes, interest and penalties or any other amounts owed by the taxpayer to the department that are due. The department of law shall prosecute the action.

C. The action shall not commence more than ten years after the amount of taxes determined to be due becomes final unless the taxpayer and the department extend the ten year limitation or enforced collection has been stayed by operation of federal or state law. If enforced collection has been stayed, the period of limitations shall be extended by the period of time that the department was stayed from engaging in enforced collections.

 

#### Section 42-1115. Payment under protest

The department shall account for amounts paid under protest until any of the following occurs:

1. A final judgment is rendered and the time for appeal expires.

2. The action begun by the taxpayer is dismissed.

3. Thirty days have elapsed after the order of the department became final and during which time the taxpayer did not begin an action.

4. The department and the taxpayer agree in writing that the amount should no longer be considered to have been paid under protest.

5. The taxpayer has taken no action with respect to the protested amount for a period of sixty days.

#### Section 42-1116. Disposition of tax revenues

A. The department of revenue shall promptly deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, all monies it collects from the taxes administered pursuant to this article except the telecommunication services excise tax, separately accounting for each type of tax and each tax classification within each type of tax. At the same time the department of revenue shall also furnish copies of the transmittal schedules to the director of the department of administration.

2. Transfer fifty percent of the monies in the fund to the attorney general for prosecuting violations pursuant to section 42-1127, subsection B.

#### Section 42-1117. Tax refund account

A. A tax refund account is established in the state general fund. The director of the department of administration shall draw all amounts necessary to make refunds under this article from the tax refund account.

B. At any time during the fiscal year if it appears that the amount in the tax refund account exceeds the amount required for refunds, the director shall transfer the excess amount from the account to the state general fund. If the transfer reduces the amount in the tax refund account below the amount required for refunds, the director of the department of administration shall adjust the amount transferred for redeposit in the tax refund account to pay such refunds. Any amount remaining in the tax refund account on June 30 of each year exceeding five hundred thousand dollars shall be transferred from the account to the state general fund.

#### Section 42-1118. Refunds, credits, offsets and abatements

A. If the department determines that any amount of tax, penalty or interest has been paid in excess of the amount actually due, the department shall credit the excess amount against any tax administered pursuant to this article, including any penalty, interest or other amounts owed by the taxpayer to the department. If it is determined that the amount cannot be credited against a tax or installment of taxes due from the taxpayer, the department may:

1. Refund the entire amount of tax, interest and penalty, in a lump sum or in not more than five annual installments, to the taxpayer from whom it was collected.

2. Issue to the taxpayer a credit voucher for the entire amount of tax, interest and penalty collected, to be carried forward and applied against future tax liabilities until exhausted.

3. Refund part, and issue a credit voucher for the balance, of the tax, interest and penalties as provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection.

B. If the total amount withheld from income under section 43-401 exceeds the amount of the tax on the employee's entire taxable income as computed under title 43, the department shall refund the amount of the excess deducted without requiring a filing of a refund claim as provided in this section.  The failure of the department to make the refund does not limit the right of the taxpayer to file a claim for a refund pursuant to this section if the claim is not barred under section 42-1106. The department shall not refund amounts less than one dollar unless specifically requested by the taxpayer at the time the return or claim for refund is filed.

C. Any overpayment that may result from withholdings or estimates pursuant to section 43-401, 43-581 or 43-582 shall not be credited or refunded unless an Arizona income tax return has been filed for the tax year for which the withholdings or estimates were made.

D. The department shall give a vendor who has a duty to collect use tax pursuant to chapter 5, article 4 of this title and who has not collected that tax full credit or offset for any use tax, interest and penalty paid to the department by the purchaser when issuing a determination of a deficiency pursuant to section 42-1108. This credit or offset shall be computed from the date of the use tax payment by the purchaser. If the purchaser has been audited by the department for use tax for the period of the purchase, the purchaser is considered to have paid the use tax to the department. For other purchases, the vendor may submit an affirmation by a purchaser on a form prescribed by the department that use tax was paid on the purchase. A fully completed certificate, taken in good faith by the vendor, constitutes proof that the vendor is entitled to this credit or offset. The department may require a purchaser who has submitted the certificate to establish the accuracy and completeness of the information contained in the certificate.  If the purchaser cannot establish the accuracy and completeness of the information, the purchaser is liable for a penalty equal to the amount of tax and interest that would have been paid by the seller and for the additional penalties pursuant to section 42-1125. Payment of the penalty relieves the purchaser of any responsibility for paying the use tax. The department may require this proof and may assess the purchaser within the later of the period of limitations set forth in section 42-1104 or one year from the date the notice of proposed deficiency is issued to the vendor if the purchaser does not establish the accuracy of the information contained in the certificate.

E. Each claim for refund shall be filed with the department in writing and shall identify the claimant by name, address and tax identification number. Each claim shall provide the amount of refund requested, the specific tax period involved and the specific grounds on which the claim is founded. Refunds are subject to setoff for debts pursuant to section 42-1122.

F. A motor vehicle manufacturer that repurchases a vehicle pursuant to section 44-1263 or for reasons of consumer satisfaction may apply for a refund of the taxes paid under chapter 5 of this title if that manufacturer has refunded the amount of tax to the consumer.  A refund is allowed under this subsection only if the manufacturer provides satisfactory proof to the department that tax amounts attributed to the sale of the vehicle were collected from the consumer and that the manufacturer refunded an amount of tax to the consumer.  Any refund provided under this subsection is in lieu of any refund on the vehicle that the dealer may otherwise be entitled to receive.  A manufacturer must apply for a refund under this subsection within four years after repurchasing the vehicle.  For the purposes of this subsection:

1. "Consumer" has the same meaning prescribed in section 44-1261.

2. "Motor vehicle manufacturer" means a corporation engaged in the business of producing passenger cars, trucks and multipurpose passenger vehicles as described in 49 Code of Federal Regulations 3.

3. "Satisfactory proof" includes copies of checks and a purchase or lease agreement that lists the vehicle identification number and that itemizes the amount that was collected as tax from the consumer.

G. The department shall not imprint the full social security number or other taxpayer identifier used pursuant to section 42-1105 on any taxpayer refund check, voucher or other credit documentation issued to the taxpayer under this section.

H. If any amount has been erroneously determined to be due from any person but not yet collected, the department shall cancel the amount or amounts on its records.

I. If, with or after the filing of a protest or an appeal with the department, the state board of tax appeals or the court, a taxpayer pays the tax protested or appealed before the department, board or court acts upon the protest or the appeal, such body shall treat the protest or the appeal as a claim for refund or an appeal from the denial of a claim for refund filed under this section.

 

#### Section 42-1119. Denial of refund

A. If the department disallows any claim for refund, it shall notify the taxpayer accordingly. The department's action on the claim is final unless the taxpayer appeals to the department in writing within the time and in the manner prescribed by section 42-1251. If the department disallows interest on any claim for refund, it shall notify the taxpayer accordingly and thereafter the claim shall be treated as a claim for refund.

B. If the department fails to mail or electronically send notice of action on any claim for refund of tax or interest within six months after the claim is filed, the taxpayer, before the department's mailing or electronic notice of action on the refund claim, may consider the claim disallowed. The taxpayer may appeal to the department for a hearing pursuant to section 42-1251.

#### Section 42-1120. Overpayment and underpayment; spouses; trusts and estates

A. If an overpayment is made by a taxpayer for any taxable period and a deficiency is owing from the spouse of the taxpayer for the same period and both the taxpayer and the spouse notify the department in writing before the expiration of the time within which credit for the overpayment may be allowed that the overpayment may be credited against the deficiency, interest shall not be assessed on such portion of the deficiency as is extinguished by the credit or added to such portion of the overpayment as is applied against the deficiency for the period of time after the date the overpayment was made.

B. If the correction of an erroneous inclusion or deduction of an item or items in the computation of income of a trust, estate or individual for any year results in an overpayment of income tax for such year by the trust, estate or individual and also results in a deficiency for the same year for a grantor of such trust or beneficiary of such estate or trust or spouse or child of such individual or spouse of such child, the overpayment, if the period within which credit for the overpayment may be allowed has not expired, shall be credited on the deficiency if the period within which the deficiency may be proposed has not expired, and the balance, if any, shall be credited or refunded. Interest shall not be assessed on such portion of the deficiency as is extinguished by the credit for the period of time after the date the overpayment was made.

C. If the correction of an erroneous inclusion or deduction of an item or items in the computation of income of a grantor of a trust, beneficiary of an estate or trust, a child or spouse of a child, or a spouse for any year results in an overpayment of income taxes for such year by the grantor, beneficiary, child or spouse, and also results in a deficiency for the same year for the trust, estate or individual, the overpayment, if the period within which credit for the overpayment may be allowed has not expired, shall be credited on the deficiency, if the period within which the deficiency may be proposed has not expired, and the balance, if any, shall be credited or refunded. Interest shall not be assessed on the portion of the deficiency as is extinguished by the credit or added to such portion of the overpayment as is applied against the deficiency for the period of time after the date the overpayment was made.

D. This section is not intended, nor shall it be construed, as a limitation on the department's duty to offset or recoup barred assessments against overpayments.

#### Section 42-1121. Overpayment and underpayment in different tax years

A. If an overpayment is made by a taxpayer for any taxable period and a deficiency is owing from the same taxpayer for any other taxable period, the overpayment, if the period within which credit for the overpayment may be allowed has not expired, shall be credited on the deficiency if the period within which assessment of the deficiency may be proposed has not expired, and the balance, if any, shall be credited or refunded to the taxpayer. Interest shall not be assessed on the portion of the deficiency that is extinguished by the credit or added to such portion of the overpayment as is applied against the deficiency for the period of time after the date the overpayment was made. For the purposes of this section, the returns of a decedent and his estate shall be considered returns of the same taxpayer and the returns of the decedent and his estate filed for the year of death shall be considered returns for different taxable years.

B. If the correction of an erroneous inclusion or deduction of an item in the computation of income of any year results in an overpayment of income taxes for one year and a deficiency for another year, the overpayment, if the period within which credit for the overpayment may be allowed has not expired, shall be credited on the deficiency, if the period within which the deficiency may be proposed has not expired, and the balance, if any, shall be credited or refunded and in any case described by this section no interest may be assessed on the portion of the deficiency that is extinguished by the credit or added to such portion of the overpayment as is applied against the deficiency for the period of time after the date the overpayment was made.

C. This section is not intended, nor shall it be construed, as a limitation on the department's duty to offset or recoup barred assessments against overpayments.

#### Section 42-1122. Setoff for debts to state agencies, political subdivisions and courts; revolving fund; penalties; definitions

A. The department shall establish a liability setoff program by which refunds under section 42-1118 and title 43, chapters 10 and 11 may be used to satisfy debts that the taxpayer owes to this state, a political subdivision or a court. The program shall comply with the standards and requirements prescribed by this section.

B. If a taxpayer owes an agency, political subdivision or court a debt, the agency, political subdivision or court, by November 1 of each year, may notify the department, furnishing at least the state agency, court or program identifier, the taxpayer's first name, last name, middle initial or middle name and suffix and social security number and any other available identification that the agency, political subdivision or court deems appropriate of the debtor as shown on the records of the agency, political subdivision or court, and the amount of the debt.

C. The department shall match the information submitted by the agency, political subdivision or court by at least two items of identification of the taxpayer with taxpayers who qualify for refunds under section 42-1118 and shall:

1. Notify the agency, political subdivision or court of a potential match, the taxpayer's home address and any additional taxpayer identification numbers used by the taxpayer. Even if the taxpayer is not entitled to a refund, the department of revenue shall provide to:

(a) The court, the clerk of the court and the department of economic security, for child support and spousal maintenance purposes only, the home address of a taxpayer whose debt for overdue support is referred for setoff and any additional taxpayer identification numbers used by the taxpayer.

(b) The court the home address and any additional taxpayer identification numbers used by the taxpayer whose debt for a court obligation is referred for setoff and who is identified by the court as a probationer on absconder status.

2. Request final agency, political subdivision or court confirmation in writing or electronically as determined by the department within ten days after the match and of the continuation of the debt.  If the agency, political subdivision or court fails to provide confirmation within forty-five days after the request, the department shall release the refund to the taxpayer.

D. An agency, political subdivision or court may submit updated information, additions, deletions and other changes on a quarterly or more frequent basis, at the convenience of the agency, political subdivision or court.

E. On confirmation pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section, the agency or political subdivision shall notify the taxpayer, by mail to the most recent physical address or electronically to the most recent email address provided by the taxpayer to the department:

1. Of the intention to set off the debt against the refund due.

2. Of the taxpayer's right to appeal to the appropriate court or to request a review by the agency or political subdivision pursuant to agency or political subdivision rule, within thirty days after the physical or electronic mailing of the notice.

F. In addition, the taxpayer shall receive notice that if the refund is intercepted in error through no fault of the taxpayer, the taxpayer is entitled to the full refund plus interest and penalties from the agency, political subdivision or court as provided by subsection O of this section.

G. The basis for a request for review as provided by subsection E of this section shall not include the validity of the claim if its validity has been established at an agency hearing, by judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction in this or any other state or by final administrative decision and shall state with specificity why the taxpayer claims the obligation does not exist or why the amount of the obligation is incorrect.

H. If, within thirty days after the physical or electronic mailing of the notice, the taxpayer requests a review by the agency or political subdivision or provides the agency or political subdivision with proof that an appeal has been taken to the appropriate court, the agency or political subdivision shall immediately notify the department and the setoff procedure shall be stayed pending resolution of the review or appeal.

I. If the department does not receive notice of a timely appeal, it shall draw and deliver a warrant in the amount of the available refund up to the amount of the debt in favor of the agency or political subdivision and notify the taxpayer of the action by physical mail or email.

J. Subsections E, G, H and I of this section do not apply to a debt imposed by a court except that the taxpayer shall receive notice of the intent to set off the debt against the refund due and the right to appeal to the court that imposed the debt within thirty days after the physical or electronic mailing of the notice.  The basis for the request for review shall not include the validity of the claim and shall state with specificity why the taxpayer claims the obligation does not exist or why the obligation is incorrect.

K. If the setoff accounts for only a portion of the refund due, the remainder of the refund shall be sent to the taxpayer.  A court shall not use this section to satisfy a judgment or payment of a fine or civil penalty until the judgment has become final or until the time to appeal the imposition of a fine or civil penalty has expired.

L. A revolving fund is established to recover and pay the cost of operating the setoff program under this section.  Monies in the fund may also be used for the general operating expenses of the department. The department may prescribe a fee to be collected from each agency, political subdivision or court using the setoff procedure or from the taxpayer, and the amount shall be deposited in the fund. The amount of the fee shall reasonably reflect the actual cost of the service provided. Monies in the revolving fund are subject to legislative appropriation.

M. If agencies, political subdivisions or courts have two or more delinquent accounts for the same taxpayer, the refund may be apportioned among them pursuant to rules prescribed by the department of revenue, except that a setoff to the department of economic security for overdue support has priority over all other setoffs.

N. If the refund is insufficient to satisfy the entire debt, the remainder of the debt may be collected by the agency, political subdivision or court as provided by law or resubmitted for setoff against subsequent refunds.

O. In the case of a refund that is intercepted in error through no fault of the taxpayer under this section, the taxpayer shall be reimbursed by the agency, political subdivision or court with interest pursuant to section 42-1123.  In addition, if all or part of a refund is intercepted in error due to an agency, political subdivision or court incorrectly identifying a taxpayer as a debtor through no fault of the taxpayer, the agency, political subdivision or court shall also pay the taxpayer a penalty as follows:

1. If the agency, political subdivision or court reimburses the taxpayer sixteen through one hundred eighty days after the agency, political subdivision or court receives notification that the refund was erroneously intercepted and the refund was received by the agency, political subdivision or court, the penalty is equal to ten percent of the amount of the refund that was intercepted.

2. If the agency, political subdivision or court reimburses the taxpayer one hundred eighty-one through three hundred sixty-five days after the agency, political subdivision or court receives notification that the refund was erroneously intercepted and the refund was received by the agency, political subdivision or court, the penalty is equal to fifteen percent of the amount of the refund that was intercepted.

3. If the agency, political subdivision or court fails to reimburse the taxpayer within three hundred sixty-five days after the agency, political subdivision or court receives notification that the refund was erroneously intercepted and the refund was received by the agency, political subdivision or court, the penalty is equal to twenty percent of the amount of the refund that was intercepted.

P. The time periods set forth in subsection O of this section shall be stayed during a review of an agency decision pursuant to section 25-522.

Q. Except as is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purposes of this section, the department shall not disclose under this section any information in violation of chapter 2, article 1 of this title.

R. An agency, political subdivision or court shall not enter into an agreement with a debtor for:

1. The assignment of any prospective refund to the agency, political subdivision or court in satisfaction of the debt.

2. Payment of the debt if the debt has been confirmed to the department for setoff under subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section.

S. If a tax refund is based on a joint income tax return and the department of economic security receives a written claim from the nonobligated spouse within forty-five days after the notice of a setoff for overdue child support, the setoff only applies to that portion of the refund due to the obligor. The nonobligated spouse shall provide to the department of economic security copies of both the obligated and nonobligated spouse's federal W-2 forms and evidence of estimated tax payments supporting the proportionate share of each spouse's payment of tax. The department of economic security shall retain the amount of the setoff refund due to the obligated spouse determined by a proration based on the tax payments of each spouse by estimated tax payment or tax withheld from wages.

T. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Agency" means:

(a) A department, agency, board, commission or institution of this state.

(b) A corporation that is under contract with this state and that provides a service that would otherwise be provided by a department, agency, board, commission or institution of this state if the contract specifically authorizes participation in the liability setoff program and the attorney general's office has reviewed the contract and approves such authorization. The participation in the liability setoff program shall be limited to debt related to the services the corporation provides for or on behalf of this state.

2. "Court" means all courts of record, justice courts and municipal courts.

3. "Debt":

(a) Means an amount over $50 that is owed to an agency, political subdivision or court by a taxpayer and may include a judgment in favor of this state or a political subdivision of this state, interest, penalties, charges, costs, fees, fines, civil penalties, surcharges, assessments, administrative charges or any other amount.

(b) Includes monies that are owed by a taxpayer for overdue support and that are referred to the department of economic security or the clerk of the court for collection.

4. "Overdue support" means a delinquency in court ordered payments for spousal maintenance or support of a child or for spousal maintenance to the parent with whom the child is living if child support is also being enforced pursuant to an assignment or application filed under 42 United States Code section 654(6) or other applicable law.

5. "Political subdivision" means a county or an incorporated city or town in this state.

#### Section 42-1123. Interest

A. If it is provided by law that interest applies as determined pursuant to this section, the department shall apply interest, compounded annually, in the same manner and at the same times as prescribed by section 6621 of the United States internal revenue code, except that the rate of interest for both overpayments and underpayments for all taxpayers is the federal short-term rate, determined pursuant to section 6621(b) of the internal revenue code, plus three percentage points.

B. On January 1 of each year the department shall add any interest outstanding as of that date to the principal amount of the tax. For purposes of this section the amount added to the principal is thereafter considered a part of the principal amount of the tax and accrues interest pursuant to this section.

C. If the tax, whether determined by the department or the taxpayer, or any portion of the tax is not paid on or before the date prescribed for its payment the department shall collect, as a part of the tax, interest on the unpaid amount at the rate determined pursuant to this section from the date prescribed for its payment until it is paid.

D. Interest on the amount assessed as a deficiency shall be assessed and paid at the same time as the deficiency at the rate determined pursuant to this section from the date prescribed for the payment of the tax to the date the deficiency is assessed. If any portion of the deficiency is paid before the date it is assessed, interest shall accrue on that portion only to the date paid.

E. If the time for filing a return is extended, the department shall collect, as part of such tax, interest on any unpaid balance at the rate determined pursuant to this section from the date on which the payment should have been made if no extension had been granted until the date the tax is paid.

F. Except in the case of a jeopardy assessment, collection of which has been stayed by the posting of a bond, if a deficiency or any interest is not paid in full within ten days from the date of notice and demand from the department, the department shall collect as a part of the tax interest on the unpaid tax or interest at the rate determined pursuant to this section from the date of the notice and demand until it is paid.

G. If an original return filed with the department shows that the taxpayer is entitled to a refund, interest is not allowed on the amount to be refunded if the refund is paid within sixty days of the last day for filing the return or sixty days from the filing of the return, whichever is later. If the department does not pay the amount of the refund due within sixty days after the date established in this subsection, the department shall pay the interest on the amount at the rate prescribed in this section from the sixty-first day to the issued date of the refund warrant. The department's annual budget shall separately state the amount necessary to satisfy the requirements of this subsection.

H. In the case of an amended return, claim for refund or refund determined through audit, interest shall be allowed and paid, with respect to any tax, from the date prescribed for the payment of that tax to the issue date of the refund warrant, but in the case of an original return of tax which is filed after the last date prescribed for filing the return and paying such tax, determined with regard to extensions, no interest may be allowed or paid for any day before the date on which the return is filed or the tax paid, whichever is later. A payment not made incident to a bona fide and orderly discharge of an actual liability or one reasonably assumed to be imposed by law is not an overpayment for the purposes of this subsection and interest is not payable on the payment.

I. If a credit or refund of any part of an overpayment would be barred under section 42-1106, subsection A, except for the provisions of section 42-1104, subsection B, paragraph 4, interest shall not be allowed or paid with respect to such part of the overpayment for any period beginning after the expiration of the period of limitation provided in section 42-1106, subsection A for filing a claim for credit or refund of such part of the overpayment and ending at the expiration of six months after the date on which the claim was filed or, if no claim was filed and the overpayment was found by the department, ending at the time the appeal was filed with the board.

J. In any judgment of any court rendered for any overpayment, interest shall be allowed at the rate determined pursuant to this section on the amount of the overpayment from the date of the payment or collection to the date of allowance of credit on account of such judgment or to a date determined by the department preceding the date of the refund warrant by not more than thirty days.

#### Section 42-1124. Failure to affix stamps or pay or account for tax; forfeiture of commodity; sale of forfeited commodity; effect of seizure and sale; request for administrative hearing; definitions

A. If the department or its authorized agents or representatives discover any luxury subject to tax under chapter 3 of this title to which official stamps have not been affixed as required or on which the tax has not been paid or accounted for, the department or its agent or representative may seize and take possession of the luxury, and it is deemed forfeited to this state. Except as provided in subsection D or E of this section, the department, within a reasonable time thereafter, pursuant to a notice posted on the premises or by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the sale is to take place, not fewer than five days before the date of sale, shall offer for sale and sell the forfeited luxuries. The department shall pay the proceeds of the sale into the state general fund. The sale shall take place in the county that is most convenient and economical. The department need not offer any property for sale if, in its opinion, the probable cost of sale exceeds the value of the property.

B. The seizure and sale do not relieve any person from the penalties provided for violating this title.

C. The department of revenue may enter into an interagency agreement with the department of transportation for the purpose of carrying out tobacco enforcement under chapter 3 of this title at ports of entry.

D. All tobacco products that are seized for violations under this title shall be forfeited to this state.  All tobacco products that are forfeited to this state pursuant to section 13-3711, 36-798.06 or 42-3461 or section 44-7111, section 6(b) shall be destroyed. If a distributor defrauds this state by knowingly and intentionally failing to keep or make any record, return, report or inventory pertaining to tobacco products, by refusing to pay any luxury tax for tobacco products subject to tax under chapter 3 of this title or by attempting to evade or defeat any requirement of this title, the distributor shall forfeit to this state all fixtures, equipment and all other materials and personal property that are located on the premises of the distributor.  Alternatively, at the request of the department, the distributor may be enjoined by an action commenced by the attorney general or a county attorney in the name of the state from engaging or continuing in any business for which a tax is imposed by this chapter until the tax has been paid and until the person has complied with this title.

E. The department may sell or otherwise dispose of any tobacco products forfeited to this state on such conditions as it deems most advantageous and just under the circumstances, unless the tobacco products are forfeited pursuant to section 13-3711, 36-798.06 or 42-3461 or section 44-7111, section 6(b). The department shall deposit the proceeds of any sales made pursuant to this subsection in the state general fund.

F. The department shall give notice of the seizure and forfeiture of tobacco products described in this section by personal service or by certified mail to all persons known by the department to have any right, title or interest in the property. Notice shall include a description of the tobacco products seized, the reason for the seizure and the time and place of the seizure.  For seizures of cigarettes of more than sixty-one cartons of two hundred cigarettes each or the equivalent in cigarette count, the department shall post and maintain an online notice of seizure and forfeiture on its website for a period of at least six months, beginning not later than ten business days after the date of the personal service of the notice to a person or the date of the mailing of the notice.  The online notice shall display the date on which the department posts the notice to the website, which shall serve as the date of publication of the notice.

G. Any person whose legal rights, duties or privileges are determined by the notice of seizure and forfeiture may file a request for an administrative hearing with the department on a form prescribed by the department. The request for an administrative hearing shall contain a statement of the petitioner's interest in the tobacco products and an explanation of why the release or recovery of the tobacco products is warranted on the ground that the tobacco products were erroneously or illegally seized.

H. The seizure and forfeiture of tobacco products by the department is an appealable agency action as defined in section 41-1092 and is governed by title 41, chapter 6, article 10 and section 42-1251, except that:

1. A request for an administrative hearing that is filed under subsection G of this section is deemed to be timely filed if the request is filed with the department within ten days after the date of personal service on the petitioner or the date of mailing the notice to the petitioner. Any person not served personally or by mail shall file the request within ten days after the date of publication of the notice. The failure of a person to file a timely request constitutes a bar to that person's right to any interest in the tobacco products, except insofar as the rights of that person may be established in an action filed by the department under this chapter.

2. If a request for an administrative hearing is not filed with the department at the expiration of ten days after the notice has been personally served, mailed or published, the department's determination is final. If a timely request for an administrative hearing has been filed with the department, the department shall request a hearing by the office of administrative hearings and the department shall suspend action until the final order of the department has been issued. An order that is issued by the office of administrative hearings is the final order of the department thirty days after the petitioner receives the decision unless a decision by the director is issued pursuant to section 42-1251. If the director issues a decision, that decision is the final order of the department.

I. For the purposes of this section, "cigarette", "distributor" and "tobacco products" have the same meanings prescribed in section 42-3001.

#### Section 42-1125. Civil penalties; definition

A. If a taxpayer fails to make and file a return for a tax administered pursuant to this article on or before the due date of the return or the due date as extended by the department, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect, four and one-half percent of the tax required to be shown on the return shall be added to the tax for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due date of the return and the date on which it is filed. The total penalty shall not exceed twenty-five percent of the tax found to be remaining due. The penalty so added to the tax is due and payable on notice and demand from the department. For the purpose of computing the penalty imposed under this subsection, the amount required to be shown as tax on a return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax that is paid on or before the beginning of the month and by the amount of any credit against the tax that may be claimed on the return. If the amount required to be shown as tax on a return is less than the amount shown as tax on the return, the penalty described in this subsection shall be applied by substituting the lower amount.

B. If a taxpayer fails or refuses to file a return on notice and demand by the department, the taxpayer shall pay a penalty of twenty-five percent of the tax, which is due and payable on notice and demand by the department, in addition to any penalty prescribed by subsection A of this section, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect. This penalty is payable on notice and demand from the department.

C. If a taxpayer fails or refuses to furnish any information requested in writing by the department, the department may add a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of any deficiency tax assessed by the department concerning the assessment of which the information was required, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect.

D. If a person fails to pay the amount shown as tax on any return within the time prescribed, a penalty of one-half of one percent, not to exceed a total of ten percent, shall be added to the amount shown as tax for each month or fraction of a month during which the failure continues, unless it is shown that the failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect.  If the department determines that the person's failure to pay was due to reasonable cause and not due to wilful neglect and that a payment agreement pursuant to section 42-2057 is appropriate, the department shall not impose the penalty unless the taxpayer fails to comply with the payment agreement.  If the taxpayer is also subject to a penalty under subsection A of this section for the same tax period, the total penalties under subsection A of this section and this subsection shall not exceed twenty-five percent.

#### Section 42-1201. Levy and distraint; definition

A. If a person liable to pay any tax neglects or refuses to pay the tax, the department may collect the tax, interest, penalty, other amounts owed to the department and such other sums as are sufficient to cover the expenses of the levy, by levy upon:

1. All property and rights to property, except property exempt under section 42-1204, belonging to the person or on which there is a lien as provided in article 4 of this chapter or section 42-17153 for the payment of the tax.

2. The accrued salary or wages of any officer, employee or elected official of this state or its political subdivisions, or any agency or instrumentality of this state or its political subdivisions, by serving a notice of levy on:

(a) The department of administration in the case of state wages or salaries.

(b) The chief disbursing officer of a political subdivision of the state in the case of wages or salaries paid by the political subdivision.

The levy shall not be made more than ten years after the amount of tax determined to be due becomes final.  The taxpayer and the department may extend the ten year limitation prescribed by this subsection for any length of time by executing a written agreement before the expiration of the ten year limitation.  If enforced collection has been stayed by operation of federal or state law, the period of limitations shall be extended by the period of time that the department was stayed from engaging in enforced collections.

C. As used in this chapter, "levy" includes the power of distraint and seizure by any means.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection E or F of this section, a levy extends only to property possessed and obligations existing at the time of the levy or within twenty-one days after the date of the levy.  In any case in which the department may levy upon property or rights to property, it may seize and sell the property or rights to the property, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible.

D. If any property or right to property upon which a levy has been made under subsection A of this section is not sufficient to satisfy the claim of the department for which the levy is made, the department may as often as may be necessary proceed to levy in like manner upon any other property liable to levy of the person against whom such claim exists, until the amount due, together with all expenses, is fully paid.

E. The effect of a levy on salary or wages payable to or received by a taxpayer is continuous from the date the levy is first made until the liability out of which the levy arose is satisfied or becomes unenforceable.

F. With respect to a levy described in subsection E of this section, the department shall promptly release the levy when the liability out of which the levy arose is satisfied or becomes unenforceable and shall promptly notify the person upon whom the levy was made that the levy has been released.

 

#### Section 42-1202. Surrender of property subject to levy; definition

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection B of this section, any person in possession of, or obligated with respect to, property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made shall, upon demand of the department, surrender such property or rights to property or discharge such obligation to the department, except such part of the property or rights to property as is, at the time of such demand, subject to an attachment or execution under any judicial process.

B. A levy on an organization with respect to a life insurance or endowment contract issued by such organization, without necessity for the surrender of the contract document, constitutes a demand by the department for payment of the amount described in this subsection and the exercise of the right of the person against whom the tax is assessed to the advance of such amount. Such organization shall pay over the amount within ninety days after service of notice of levy. The notice shall include a certification by the department that a copy of the notice has been mailed to the person against whom the tax is assessed at the person's last known address. The levy is deemed to be satisfied if such organization pays over to the department the amount which the person against whom the tax is assessed could have received from the organization on the date prescribed in this subsection for the satisfaction of the levy, increased by the amount of any advance, including contractual interest, made to such person on or after the date the organization had actual notice or knowledge of the existence of the lien with respect to which the levy is made, other than an advance, including contractual interest, made automatically to maintain the contract in force under an agreement entered into before the organization has such notice or knowledge. The satisfaction of a levy under this subsection is without prejudice to any civil action for the enforcement of any lien imposed by this chapter with respect to the contract.

C. A person who fails or refuses to surrender any property or rights to property, subject to levy, upon demand by the department, is liable in person and estate to this state in a sum equal to the value of the property or rights to property not so surrendered, but not exceeding the amount of taxes for the collection of which such levy has been made, with costs and interest on such sum at the rate determined pursuant to section 42-1123 from the date of such levy, or, in the case of a levy described in section 42-1201, subsection E or F, from the date such person would otherwise have been obligated to pay such amounts to the taxpayer. Any amount, other than costs, recovered under this subsection shall be credited against the tax liability for the collection of which the levy was made.

D. A person in possession of or obligated with respect to property or rights to property subject to levy upon which a levy has been made who, upon demand by the department, surrenders the property or rights to property, or discharges the obligation, to the department or who pays a liability under subsection C of this section is discharged from any obligation or liability to the delinquent taxpayer with respect to such property or rights to property arising from the surrender or payment. In the case of a levy which is satisfied pursuant to subsection B of this section, the organization is also discharged from any obligation or liability to any beneficiary arising from such surrender or payment.

E. As used in this section, "person" includes an officer or employee of a corporation, an officer, employee or elected official of this state or its political subdivisions, or any agency or instrumentality of this state or its political subdivisions, or a member or employee of a partnership, who as such officer, employee, elected official or member is under a duty to surrender the property or rights to property, or to discharge the obligation.

3. The department shall publicly declare the nature of the possible misunderstanding or misapplication and the proposed definition of the class of affected taxpayers and shall conduct a public hearing to hear testimony regarding the extent of the misunderstanding or misapplication and the definition of the affected class.  Within sixty days after close of the public hearing, the department shall notify the attendees at the public hearing and publish a public notice on its website stating whether relief will be granted.

### Article 3 - Private Taxpayer Rulings

#### Section 42-2101. Private taxpayer rulings; request; revocation or modification; taxpayer information ruling; definitions

A. The department may issue private taxpayer rulings to taxpayers and potential taxpayers on request. Each request shall be in writing and shall:

1. State the name, address and, if applicable, taxpayer identifying number of the taxpayer or potential taxpayer who requests the ruling.

2. Describe all facts that are relevant to the requested ruling.

3. State whether, to the best knowledge of the taxpayer or potential taxpayer, the issue or related issues are being considered by the department in connection with an active audit, protest or appeal that involves the taxpayer or potential taxpayer and whether the same request has been or is being submitted to another taxing authority for a ruling.

4. Be signed by the taxpayer or potential taxpayer who makes the request or by an authorized representative of the taxpayer or potential taxpayer.

B. A taxpayer ruling request that complies with subsection A, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section and that is signed by a representative of a taxpayer or potential taxpayer shall be considered a request for a taxpayer information ruling instead of a private taxpayer ruling.

C. A private taxpayer ruling or taxpayer information ruling may be revoked or modified by either:

1. A change or clarification in the law that was applicable at the time the ruling was issued, including changes or clarifications caused by legislation, adopted administrative rules and court decisions.

2. Actual written notice by the department to the last known address of the taxpayer or potential taxpayer of the revocation or modification of the private taxpayer ruling or taxpayer information ruling if the taxpayer identifying information has been disclosed to the department pursuant to subsection E of this section. If taxpayer identifying information has not been disclosed, written notice by the department to the last known address of the taxpayer representative who requested the ruling constitutes notice to the taxpayer or potential taxpayer.

D. With respect to the taxpayer or prospective taxpayer to whom the private taxpayer ruling was issued, the revocation or modification of a private taxpayer ruling shall not be applied retroactively to tax periods or tax years before the effective date of the revocation or modification, and the department shall not assess any penalty or tax attributable to erroneous advice that it furnished to the taxpayer or potential taxpayer in the private taxpayer ruling if:

1. The taxpayer reasonably relied on the private taxpayer ruling.

2. The penalty or tax did not result either from a failure by the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate information or from a change in the information.

E. Subsection D of this section applies to a taxpayer information ruling if the taxpayer or potential taxpayer provides its name, address, identifying number, if applicable, and authorization pursuant to section 42-2003, subsection A, paragraph 1 for the representative of the taxpayer or potential taxpayer before the date the department publishes the ruling.  The department shall notify the representative of the taxpayer or potential taxpayer of the proposed publication date.  If the director has determined that the taxpayer information ruling should not be published pursuant to subsection M of this section, subsection D of this section applies if the taxpayer or potential taxpayer provides the identifying information before the date specified by the department on issuing the taxpayer information ruling to the representative. If the taxpayer or potential taxpayer does not provide the department with the identifying information and representative authorization before the proposed publication date, or for an unpublished ruling, the date specified by the department, the taxpayer information ruling is not binding on the department for the purpose of abating interest, penalty or tax.

F. A private taxpayer ruling or taxpayer information ruling may not be relied on, cited or introduced into evidence in any proceeding by a taxpayer other than the taxpayer who has received the private taxpayer ruling.

G. A taxpayer may apply for an administrative hearing to determine the propriety of a retroactive application of a revoked or modified private taxpayer ruling by filing a written petition with the department pursuant to section 42-1251 within forty-five days after receiving written notice of the department's intent to retroactively apply a revoked or modified private taxpayer ruling. This subsection applies to a taxpayer information ruling if the taxpayer has disclosed the taxpayer's identifying information pursuant to subsection E of this section.

H. A private taxpayer ruling or taxpayer information ruling constitutes the department's interpretation of the law or rules only as they apply to the taxpayer making, and the particular facts contained in, the request.

I. A private taxpayer ruling or taxpayer information ruling may be issued only if no tax has accrued with respect to the transactions, events or facts contained in the request. The department may issue a private taxpayer ruling or taxpayer information ruling addressing a taxpayer's ongoing business activities, except that the ruling applies only to transactions that occur or tax liabilities that accrue from and after the date the taxpayer receives the ruling.

J. Within thirty days after receiving a written request pursuant to subsection A of this section, the department shall meet with the requestor to discuss the facts and circumstances pertaining to the request, at a time and place designated by the department, unless the requestor waives this meeting. The department shall issue private taxpayer rulings or taxpayer information rulings within ninety days after receiving the written request, unless the department and the requestor agree to delay the ruling. If the ruling is expected to be delayed, the department shall notify the requestor of the basis for the proposed delay and the proposed date of issuance.  Pursuant to subsection A of this section, the department may decline to issue a ruling, and this subsection does not require the department to issue a ruling. If the department declines to issue a ruling, the department shall issue appropriate written assistance or advice that explains the reason the department is declining to issue a ruling and provide a general discussion of relevant tax principles or applications.

K. The department shall provide the requestor with a draft of the private taxpayer ruling or taxpayer information ruling at least thirty days before issuing the ruling pursuant to subsection J of this section. If requested by the requestor, the department shall meet with the requestor within fourteen days after providing the draft ruling, at a time and place designated by the department, to discuss the contents of the draft ruling.

L. The department shall maintain the private taxpayer ruling or taxpayer information ruling as a public record and make it available at a reasonable cost for public inspection and copying. The text of private taxpayer or taxpayer information rulings is open to public inspection subject to the confidentiality requirements prescribed by article 1 of this chapter.

M. At the time of making a private taxpayer ruling or taxpayer information ruling request, a taxpayer or potential taxpayer may submit a written request that the ruling not be published due to concerns about confidentiality or other disclosed reasons.  If the director determines that the ruling should not be published and the taxpayer requests that the ruling be kept confidential, the ruling shall be deemed confidential for the purpose of section 39-121.01, subsection D, paragraph 2. If the director determines that the ruling should be published and the taxpayer requests that the ruling be kept confidential, the taxpayer may withdraw the ruling request, and the department shall not proceed with a ruling if the request is withdrawn. Notwithstanding section 41-1092.02, the decision of the director to publish is not an appealable agency action as defined in section 41-1092 and is not subject to appeal by the taxpayer.

N. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Private taxpayer ruling" means a written determination by the department issued on or after September 21, 1991 that interprets and applies one or more statutes contained in this title or title 43 and any applicable administrative rules that the department has adopted to the specific prospective facts described in the request for a private taxpayer ruling.

2. The taxpayer making an election under this section establishes that in signing the return the taxpayer did not know, and had no reason to know, that there was an understatement.

B. If a taxpayer qualifies for relief under subsection A of this section, the relief extends to the amount of liability for tax, interest and penalties that is attributable to the understatement.

C. If a taxpayer would qualify for relief under subsection A of this section except that under subsection A, paragraph 2 the taxpayer establishes that in signing the return the taxpayer did not know, and had no reason to know, the extent of the understatement, the relief extends only to the extent the liability for tax, interest and penalties is attributable to the portion of the understatement of which the taxpayer did not know and had no reason to know.

D. The department shall make any determination under this section without regard to community property laws.

E. An election made by an individual under this section after the department has collected tax attributable to the erroneous items is considered to be a claim for refund pursuant to section 42-1118.

C. The department shall allocate a deficiency under this section as follows:

2. If all or part of a deficiency is attributable to the disallowance of a credit, and that credit is allocated to one individual under subsection D of this section, the deficiency or portion shall be allocated to that individual. That amount shall not be taken into account under paragraph 1 of this subsection.

D. For the purposes of this section, items giving rise to the deficiency shall be allocated as follows:

1. Any item giving rise to a deficiency on a joint return shall be allocated to the individuals filing the return in the same manner as it would have been allocated if the individuals had filed separate returns for the taxable year, without regard to community property laws.

2. An item otherwise allocable to an individual under paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be allocated to the other individual filing the joint return to the extent the item gave rise to a tax benefit on the joint return to the other individual.

3. The director may provide for allocation of any item in a different manner if the department establishes that the different allocation is appropriate due to fraud of one or both individuals.

E. If the tax liability of the taxpayer's child is included on the joint return:

1. The child's liability shall be disregarded in computing the liability of either spouse.

2. The child's liability shall be allocated appropriately between the spouses.

F. Any deficiency that is assessed with respect to the return shall not exceed the portion of the deficiency properly allocable to the individual.

G. Each electing individual under this section has the burden of proof with respect to establishing the portion of any deficiency allocable to that individual.

H. An election under this section is invalid if the department demonstrates that assets were transferred between individuals filing a joint return as part of a fraudulent scheme by those individuals.

I. If the department demonstrates that an individual making an election under this section had actual knowledge at the time the individual signed the return of any item giving rise to all or part of a deficiency that is not allocable to that individual under subsection E of this section, the election does not apply to that deficiency. This subsection does not apply if the individual with actual knowledge establishes that the return was signed under duress.

J. Any determination under this section shall be made without regard to community property laws.

K. An election made by an individual under this section after the department has collected tax attributable to the deficiency is considered to be a claim for refund pursuant to section 42-1118. The individual making an election after making the payment must make the election within six months after making the payment or within the time limits prescribed by section 42-1106, whichever period expires later.

L. A taxpayer may appeal a determination under this section pursuant to section 42-1251 or 42-1253.

The report is subject to the following conditions:

1. The report shall be provided in the form and manner prescribed by the department.

The bond shall be in such amount, but not less than two thousand dollars, as will assure the payment of the transaction privilege taxes which may reasonably be expected to be incurred by the licensed establishment for a period of one hundred fifty days.

C. The director, by rule, may establish classes of expected tax liability in five thousand dollar increments, beginning with the minimum bond amount prescribed in subsection B of this section.

#### Section 42-5009. Certificates establishing deductions; liability for making false certificate; tax exclusion; definitions

A. A person who conducts any business classified under article 2 of this chapter may establish entitlement to the allowable deductions from the tax base of that business by both:

1. Marking the invoice for the transaction to indicate that the gross proceeds of sales or gross income derived from the transaction was deducted from the tax base.

2. Obtaining a certificate executed by the purchaser indicating the name and address of the purchaser, the precise nature of the business of the purchaser, the purpose for which the purchase was made, the necessary facts to establish the appropriate deduction and the tax license number of the purchaser to the extent the deduction depends on the purchaser conducting business classified under article 2 of this chapter and a certification that the person executing the certificate is authorized to do so on behalf of the purchaser. The certificate may be disregarded if the seller has reason to believe that the information contained in the certificate is not accurate or complete.

B. A person who does not comply with subsection A of this section may establish entitlement to the deduction by presenting facts necessary to support the entitlement, but the burden of proof is on that person.

C. The department may prescribe a form for the certificate described in subsection A of this section.  Under such rules as it may prescribe, the department may also describe transactions with respect to which a person is not entitled to rely solely on the information contained in the certificate provided for in subsection A of this section but must instead obtain such additional information as required by the rules in order to be entitled to the deduction.

D. If a seller is entitled to a deduction by complying with subsection A of this section, the department may require the purchaser that caused the execution of the certificate to establish the accuracy and completeness of the information required to be contained in the certificate that would entitle the seller to the deduction. If the purchaser cannot establish the accuracy and completeness of the information, the purchaser is liable in an amount equal to any tax, penalty and interest that the seller would have been required to pay under this article if the seller had not complied with subsection A of this section. Payment of the amount under this subsection exempts the purchaser from liability for any tax imposed under article 4 of this chapter. The amount shall be treated as tax revenues collected from the seller in order to designate the distribution base for purposes of section 42-5029.

E. If a seller is entitled to a deduction by complying with subsection B of this section, the department may require the purchaser to establish the accuracy and completeness of the information provided to the seller that entitled the seller to the deduction.  If the purchaser cannot establish the accuracy and completeness of the information, the purchaser is liable in an amount equal to any tax, penalty and interest that the seller would have been required to pay under this article if the seller had not complied with subsection B of this section. Payment of the amount under this subsection exempts the purchaser from liability for any tax imposed under article 4 of this chapter. The amount shall be treated as tax revenues collected from the seller in order to designate the distribution base for purposes of section 42-5029.

F. The department may prescribe a form for a certificate used to establish entitlement to the deductions described in section 42-5061, subsection A, paragraph 46 and section 42-5063, subsection B, paragraph 3.  Under rules the department may prescribe, the department may also require additional information for the seller to be entitled to the deduction. If a seller is entitled to the deductions described in section 42-5061, subsection A, paragraph 46 and section 42-5063, subsection B, paragraph 3, the department may require the purchaser who executed the certificate to establish the accuracy and completeness of the information contained in the certificate that would entitle the seller to the deduction. If the purchaser cannot establish the accuracy and completeness of the information, the purchaser is liable in an amount equal to any tax, penalty and interest that the seller would have been required to pay under this article. Payment of the amount under this subsection exempts the purchaser from liability for any tax imposed under article 4 of this chapter.  The amount shall be treated as tax revenues collected from the seller in order to designate the distribution base for purposes of section 42-5029.

G. If a seller claims a deduction under section 42-5061, subsection A, paragraph 25 and establishes entitlement to the deduction with an exemption letter that the purchaser received from the department and the exemption letter was based on a contingent event, the department may require the purchaser that received the exemption letter to establish the satisfaction of the contingent event within a reasonable time. If the purchaser cannot establish the satisfaction of the event, the purchaser is liable in an amount equal to any tax, penalty and interest that the seller would have been required to pay under this article if the seller had not been furnished the exemption letter. Payment of the amount under this subsection exempts the purchaser from liability for any tax imposed under article 4 of this chapter. The amount shall be treated as tax revenues collected from the seller in order to designate the distribution base for purposes of section 42-5029. For the purposes of this subsection, "reasonable time" means a time limitation that the department determines and that does not exceed the time limitations pursuant to section 42-1104.

H. The department shall prescribe forms for certificates used to establish the satisfaction of the criteria necessary to qualify the sale of a motor vehicle for the deductions described in section 42-5061, subsection A, paragraph 14, paragraph 28, subdivision (a) and paragraph 44 and subsection U. Except as provided in subsection J of this section, to establish entitlement to these deductions, a motor vehicle dealer shall retain:

1. A valid certificate as prescribed by this subsection completed by the purchaser and obtained before the issuance of the nonresident registration permit authorized by section 28-2154.

2. A copy of the nonresident registration permit authorized by section 28-2154.

3. A legible copy of a current valid driver license issued to the purchaser by another state or foreign country that indicates an address outside of this state. For the sale of a motor vehicle to a nonresident entity, the entity's representative must have a current valid driver license issued by the same jurisdiction as that in which the entity is located.

4. For the purposes of the deduction provided by section 42-5061, subsection A, paragraph 14, subdivision (a), a certificate documenting the delivery of the motor vehicle to an out-of-state location.

I. Notwithstanding subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section, if a motor vehicle dealer has established entitlement to a deduction by complying with subsection H of this section, the department may require the purchaser who executed the certificate to establish the accuracy and completeness of the information contained in the certificate that entitled the motor vehicle dealer to the deduction. If the purchaser cannot establish the accuracy and completeness of the information, the purchaser is liable in an amount equal to any tax, penalty and interest that the motor vehicle dealer would have been required to pay under this article and under articles IV and V of the model city tax code as defined in section 42-6051. Payment of the amount under this subsection exempts the purchaser from liability for any tax imposed under article 4 of this chapter and any tax imposed under article VI of the model city tax code as defined in section 42-6051. The amount shall be treated as tax revenues collected from the motor vehicle dealer in order to designate the distribution base for purposes of section 42-5029.

J. To establish entitlement to the deduction described in section 42-5061, subsection A, paragraph 44, a public consignment auction dealer as defined in section 28-4301 shall submit the valid certificate prescribed by subsection H of this section to the department and retain a copy for its records.

K. Notwithstanding any other law, compliance with subsection H of this section by a motor vehicle dealer entitles the motor vehicle dealer to the exemption provided in section 42-6004, subsection A, paragraph 4.

L. The department shall prescribe a form for a certificate to be used by a person that is not subject to tax under section 42-5075 when the person is engaged by a contractor that is subject to tax under section 42-5075 for a project that is taxable under section 42-5075. The certificate permits the person purchasing tangible personal property to be incorporated or fabricated by the person into any real property, structure, project, development or improvement to provide documentation to a retailer that the sale of tangible personal property qualifies for the deduction under section 42-5061, subsection A, paragraph 27, subdivision (b). A prime contractor shall obtain the certificate from the department and shall provide a copy to any such person working on the project. The prime contractor shall obtain a new certificate for each project to which this subsection applies. For the purposes of this subsection, the following apply:

1. The person that is not subject to tax under section 42-5075 may use the certificate issued pursuant to this subsection only with respect to tangible personal property that will be incorporated into a project for which the gross receipts are subject to tax under section 42-5075.

2. The department shall issue the certificate to the prime contractor on receiving sufficient documentation to establish that the prime contractor meets the requirements of this subsection.

3. If any person uses the certificate provided under this subsection to purchase tangible personal property to be used in a project that is not subject to tax under section 42-5075, the person is liable in an amount equal to any tax, penalty and interest that the seller would have been required to pay under this article if the seller had not complied with subsection A of this section. Payment of the amount under this section exempts the person from liability for any tax imposed under article 4 of this chapter. The amount shall be sourced under section 42-5040, subsection A, paragraph 2.

M. Notwithstanding any other law, compliance with subsection L of this section by a person that is not subject to tax under section 42-5075 entitles the person to the exemption allowed by section 465, subsection (k) of the model city tax code when purchasing tangible personal property to be incorporated or fabricated by the person into any real property, structure, project, development or improvement.

N. The requirements of subsections A and B of this section do not apply to owners, proprietors or tenants of agricultural lands or farms who sell livestock or poultry feed that is grown or raised on their lands to any of the following:

1. Persons who feed their own livestock or poultry.

2. Persons who are engaged in the business of producing livestock or poultry commercially.

3. Persons who are engaged in the business of feeding livestock or poultry commercially or who board livestock noncommercially.

O. A vendor who has reason to believe that a certificate prescribed by this section is not accurate or complete will not be relieved of the burden of proving entitlement to the exemption. A vendor that accepts a certificate in good faith will be relieved of the burden of proof and the purchaser may be required to establish the accuracy of the claimed exemption. If the purchaser cannot establish the accuracy and completeness of the information provided in the certificate, the purchaser is liable for an amount equal to the transaction privilege tax, penalty and interest that the vendor would have been required to pay if the vendor had not accepted the certificate.

P. Notwithstanding any other law, an online lodging operator, as defined in section 42-5076, shall be entitled to an exclusion from any applicable taxes for any online lodging transaction, as defined in section 42-5076, facilitated by an online lodging marketplace, as defined in section 42-5076, for which the online lodging operator has obtained from the online lodging marketplace written notice that the online lodging marketplace is registered with the department to collect applicable taxes for all online lodging transactions facilitated by the online lodging marketplace, and transaction history documenting tax collected by the online lodging marketplace, pursuant to section 42-5005, subsection L.

Q. The department shall prescribe the form of a certificate to be used by a person purchasing an aircraft to document eligibility for a deduction pursuant to section 42-5061, subsection B, paragraph 8, subdivision (a), item (v) or an exemption pursuant to section 42-5159, subsection B, paragraph 8, subdivision (a), item (v), relating to aircraft. The person must provide this certificate and documentation confirming that the operational control of the aircraft has been transferred or will be transferred immediately after the purchase to one or more persons described in section 42-5061, subsection B, paragraph 8, subdivision (a), item (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) or section 42-5159, subsection B, paragraph 8, subdivision (a), item (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv).  Operational control of the aircraft must be transferred for at least fifty percent of the aircraft's flight hours. If such operational control is not transferred for at least fifty percent of the aircraft's flight hours during the recapture period, the owner of the aircraft is liable for an amount equal to any tax that the seller or purchaser would have been required to pay under this chapter at the time of the sale, plus penalty and interest. The recapture period begins on the date that operational control of the aircraft is first transferred and ends on the later of the date the aircraft is fully depreciated for federal income tax purposes or five years after operational control was first transferred. For the purposes of this subsection, operational control of the aircraft must be within the meaning of federal aviation administration operations specification A008, or its successor, except that:

1. If it is determined that operational control has been transferred for less than fifty percent but more than forty percent of the aircraft's flight hours, the owner of the aircraft is liable for an amount equal to any tax that the seller or purchaser would have been required to pay under this chapter at the time of the sale, plus interest.

2. If the aircraft is sold during the recapture period, the seller is not liable for the amount determined pursuant to this subsection unless the operational control of the aircraft had not been transferred for at least fifty percent of the aircraft's flight hours at the time of the sale.

Proceeds from the sale of the property that are received after transfer of title and that are unrelated to the modifications made subsequent to the transfer of title are not considered gross proceeds of sale or gross income from the modifications.

2. If the original owner enters into an agreement separate from the contract for sale of the real property providing for amounts to be paid to the original owner for the modifications to be made in the period subsequent to the transfer of title to the property, the amounts are included in the original owner's gross proceeds of sale or gross income received for the modifications made subsequent to the transfer of title.

3. If the original owner is responsible to the new owner for modifications made to the property in the period subsequent to the transfer of title and derives any gross proceeds of sale or gross income from the project subsequent to the transfer of title other than a delayed disbursement from escrow unrelated to the modifications, it is presumed that the amounts are received for the modifications made subsequent to the transfer of title unless the contrary is established by the owner through its books, records and papers kept in the regular course of business.

#### Section 42-12152. Criteria for classification of property used for agricultural purposes; exception; affidavit

A. Property is not eligible for classification as property used for agricultural purposes unless it meets the following criteria:

1. The primary use of the property is as agricultural land and the property has been in active production according to generally accepted agricultural practices for at least three of the last five years.  Property that has been in active production may be:

(a) Inactive for a period of not more than twelve months as a result of acts of God.

(b) Inactive as a result of participation in:

(i) A federal farm program that allows voluntary land conserving use acreage or acreage conservation, or both.

(ii) A scheduled crop rotation program.

(c) Inactive or partially inactive due to a temporary or partial reduction in or transfer of the available water supply or irrigation district water allotments for agriculture use in the farm unit. For land within an irrigation district in a county with a population of less than nine hundred thousand persons, the temporary or partial reduction or transfer may be verified by an official certification from the irrigation district to the county assessor that confirms the reduction or transfer, except that if that land is located in an active management area and the land does not have an irrigation grandfathered groundwater right, the land is not eligible as cropland. A certification for temporary or partial reduction is not valid for full inactivity of the farm unit for more than one year.

(d) Grazing land that is inactive or partially inactive due to reduced carrying capacity or generally accepted range management practices.

2. There is a reasonable expectation of operating profit, exclusive of land cost, from the agricultural use of the property.

3. If the property consists of noncontiguous parcels, the noncontiguous parcels must be managed and operated on a unitary basis and each parcel must make a functional contribution to the agricultural use of the property.

B. If feedlot or dairy operations that are in active production are moved to another property at which the operations are in active production, the requirement that the property be in active production for at least three of the last five years does not apply to the property to which the operations are moved for the first three years after the operations are moved.

C. The requirement in subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section is satisfied if the owner files with the assessor an affidavit of agricultural use, signed by the owner attesting that all information in the affidavit is true and the property is actively producing with an expectation of profit.

#### Section 42-12153. Application for classification of property used for agricultural purposes

A. The county assessor shall make agricultural use application forms available that require the following information in addition to any other information prescribed by the department:

1. The size of the property.

2. The type of crops grown on the property.

3. The type and number of animal units raised on the property.

4. The number of acres leased for agricultural purposes and the terms of the lease for each parcel leased.

5. A verification that the property meets the requirements prescribed in section 42-12152.

B. The owner of property or the owner's designated agent under section 42-16001 shall file a completed agricultural use application form with the county assessor before the property may be classified as being used for agricultural purposes. If the ownership of a property changes, an agricultural use application form must be filed by the new owner within sixty days after the change in ownership to maintain the agricultural use status. If the owner or the owner's agent fails to file an application form as prescribed in this subsection, the assessor shall not classify the property, on notice of valuation, as being used for agricultural purposes. The owner or agent may appeal the classification as prescribed by chapter 16, article 2 or 5 of this title regardless of whether the owner or agent filed an application form.

 

#### Section 42-12154. Approval of nonconforming property

B. The county assessor may continue the agricultural classification of owner occupied property that has fewer than the minimum number of animal units as prescribed in section 42-12151, paragraph 3 if the number of animal units equals, as nearly as practicable, the property's carrying capacity.

#### Section 42-12155. Notice of approval or disapproval; appeal

A. The county assessor shall notify the property owner whether the assessor has approved or disapproved the agricultural classification of the property on or before the date on which the assessor next mails the owner the notice of valuation for the property.

B. If the assessor disapproved the agricultural classification, the assessor shall notify the owner of the reason for disapproval within one hundred twenty days of the application.

C. The owner may appeal the decision of the assessor as prescribed by chapter 16, article 2, 5 or 6 of this title.

#### Section 42-12156. Notice of change in use

A. If all or part of the property ceases to qualify as agricultural property under this article, the person who owns the property at the time of change shall notify the county assessor within sixty days after the change.

B. If the county assessor determines that there has been a change of use and the property ceases to qualify as agricultural property under this article, the county assessor shall notify the property owner by certified mail of the reason for reclassifying the property and include information for the property owner to appeal the reclassification.

#### Section 42-12157. Recapture and penalty for false information or failure to notify of change in use

If an owner of property or the owner's agent intentionally provides false information on an application form, or fails to provide the notice required under section 42-12156:

1. The property shall be reclassified immediately as being used for a nonagricultural use and shall be valued at its nonagricultural full cash value.

A. In recognition of the importance of the open space and economic benefits of golf courses, county assessors shall value all golf courses uniformly based on guidelines prescribed by the department.

B. Subject to section 42-13154, values shall be made on the assumption that no other property use is possible.

C. Land shall be valued at five hundred dollars per acre.

The improvement value of the golf course is established by the department's 1988 per hole cost, as prescribed in subsection E of this section for the grade of the golf course as described in the department's assessment practices manual for golf course assessment effective January 1, 1986. The per hole cost shall be multiplied by the number of holes included. The value shall be adjusted to reflect the application of economic obsolescence, which shall be uniformly determined as follows:

1. Determine the number of actual rounds of golf played during the most recent twelve months ending on July 31.

2. Multiply the rounds played during the peak month by twelve to determine the number of rounds of play the course would have had under optimum conditions.

3. Divide the actual number of rounds played during the year by the optimum rounds played.

4. The quotient is the relationship between the actual rounds played and projected play under optimum conditions or the per cent good after the economic obsolescence has been deducted.

5. Apply the obsolescence by multiplying the total per hole cost by the per cent good.

6. The obsolescence factors developed by applying the procedures prescribed by paragraphs 1 through 5 shall be applied to the data submitted to the county assessor annually by golf course owners or managers on a form prescribed by the department. The assessor shall mail the form to the last known mailing address of each golf course owner or manager on or before August 1 of each year. The form shall reflect the number of rounds played by month for the most recent twelve months ending on July 31. The form shall be returned to the county assessor not later than September 30 to receive the economic obsolescence adjustment.

7. Add the replacement cost new less the depreciation for the structures and additional items to determine the full cash value of the facility improvements.

8. To determine the full cash value of the golf course, add the per acre value as reflected in this section, the valuation of the golf course improvements, adjusted for obsolescence pursuant to paragraphs 1 through 6, and the valuation of the structures and additional items pursuant to paragraph 7.

E. For tax year 1995, the 1988 per hole improvement cost described in subsection D of this section shall be used to value golf courses. In each subsequent tax year the per hole improvement costs shall be adjusted using the change in the GDP price deflator as defined in section 41-563. For purposes of this subsection, the per hole improvement cost values include landscaping, bridges, lakes, lake liners, practice ranges, irrigation systems, paths, golf greens and tees.

#### Section 42-13154. Covenant not to convert golf course to another use; violation; penalty

On review or appeal of a valuation determined under this section, the owner of a shopping center may elect to have the valuation of the shopping center determined by the income method commonly known as the straight line building residual method if the owner submits all reasonably necessary income and expense information. The reviewing body shall use the information submitted by the owner and may also use any other information customarily analyzed under this method. The capitalization rate used for purposes of this subsection shall be comprised of:

1. For the 1983 tax year a discount rate of 10.5 per cent, adjusted each year thereafter according to the percentage change in the weighted average cost of monies derived from interest paid on savings accounts, federal home loan bank advances and other borrowed money as reported by the federal home loan bank of San Francisco for this state for the most recent twelve month period ending June 30.

2. The replacement cost less depreciation method pursuant to section 42-13203.

3. The market comparison method, if a sale of the subject property occurred within two years before the date of valuation and no material change to the property, its lease terms, tenants or occupancy rates or any other material fact has occurred since the sale.

### Article 13 - Valuation of Low-Income Multifamily Residential Rental Property

#### Section 42-13601. Definitions

In this article, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Conventional multifamily property" means a residential rental property that does not meet the requirements prescribed in paragraph 3 of this section.

2. "Low-income housing tax credit program" means the federal low-income housing tax credit program established by the tax reform act of 1986, codified in section 42 of the internal revenue code and administered by the Arizona department of housing pursuant to section 35-728 to encourage construction and rehabilitation of low-income rental housing.

3. "Low-income multifamily residential rental property" means multifamily residential property to which all of the following apply:

(a) The owner received an allocation of federal income tax credits through the low-income housing tax credit program.

(b) The property remains both income and rent restricted consistent with the low-income housing tax credit program and the provisions of the declaration of affirmative land use restrictive covenants agreement recorded on the property.  The requirement of this subdivision is met if an affirmative land use restrictive covenants agreement is not yet recorded on the property but the property is otherwise subject to both income and rent restrictions under the low-income housing tax credit program.

(c) A federal, state or tribal court has not entered a judgment or order based on a finding that an act or omission of an owner or operator of the property constitutes a breach or violation of either:

B. On timely election by the owner of a low-income multifamily residential rental property, the county assessor shall value property under this article based on the income method to value using the actual annual income and actual annual expenses of the property and using a capitalization rate that is based on the prevailing capitalization rate for a conventional multifamily property in the same geographic area adjusted to account for the differences between low-income multifamily residential rental properties and conventional multifamily properties, including the additional risk that the recorded affirmative land use restrictive covenants agreement places on the net operating income from the property, the restriction to the use of the property for affordable housing, the time period that the income and use restrictions remain in effect on the property and the illiquidity caused by the reduced pool of qualified potential buyers. After the capitalization rate is determined, the county assessor shall add the capitalization rate to the effective tax rate before calculating the full cash value.

C. The owner of a low-income multifamily residential rental property may elect to have the valuation of the property determined by the income method to value by submitting the three most current annual audited financial statements required by the Arizona department of housing to the county assessor before September 1 of the year immediately preceding the year for which the property will be valued.  If the owner does not yet have three annual audited financial statements because the property is too new to the low-income housing tax credit program to have three years of audited data, the owner may submit and the county assessor shall use for valuation purposes the available audited financial statements and the pro forma income and expense data that was provided to the Arizona department of housing at the time the low-income housing tax credit application was submitted to the Arizona department of housing.

1. Determine the full cash value ratio.

2. Determine the original cost by vintage year for 2001 and all prior years.

3. Multiply the original costs for real property improvements and personal property by vintage year by the full cash value ratio to reflect the tax year 2003 full cash value by vintage year.

4. Divide the full cash value by vintage year as calculated in paragraph 3 of this subsection of real property improvements and personal property by the valuation factors reflected in the department’s valuation tables as prescribed in section 42-14156, without phase-in adjustments prescribed in section 42-14156, subsection A, paragraph 3.

9. "Income change factor" means dividing the change in earnings before interest and taxes by the change in the capitalization rate. If the change in earnings before interest and taxes does not apply, the income change factor does not apply.

10. "Major plant addition or retirement" means an addition or retirement of plant in the year preceding the current valuation year that results in an increase or decrease of at least twenty percent of the original cost of plant in service.

11. "Noncapitalized leased operating property" means property that is subject to an agreement that transfers the use of property to the lessee during the term of the lease and that is not capitalized on the lessee's balance sheet.

12. "Preliminary system value" means the base value multiplied by the value change factor.

13. "System net book value of plant" means the original cost of the system plant in service minus the related accumulated provision for depreciation.

14. "System value" means the sum of the system value of plant in service, construction work in progress, materials and supplies, noncapitalized leased property and gas stored underground.

15. "Value change factor" means the average of the income change factor and the asset change factor. If the income change factor does not apply, the value change factor is the asset change factor. If the asset change factor does not apply, the value change factor does not apply.

1. There is a final ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in this state that the full cash value of a pipeline in this state using the method prescribed by section 42-14204 is more than the market value of the pipeline property using standard appraisal methods and techniques. In such cases, the final full cash value of the system plant in service determined by the court for the most recent tax year involved in any such tax appeal is the base value for the subsequent tax year, and the department shall adjust all valuations for future years pursuant to section 42-14204.

2. There is an agreement between a pipeline company and the department that is the result of a pending tax appeal, in which the parties enter into a binding stipulation, approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, to adjust the full cash value of the system plant in service as of a specific valuation date.  In such cases, the department shall adjust the base value as set forth in the stipulation.

3. There is an agreement between a pipeline company and the department to correct an error in the calculation of the full cash value of the system plant in service for a pipeline that operates in this state. In such cases, the department shall adjust the base value as set forth in the agreement. Any agreement to adjust the base value to correct such an error shall be in writing and signed by the director and an officer of the pipeline company before the base value is adjusted.

Property that a railroad company owns or leases but that is not used in operating the railroad is not considered to be operating property and shall be valued by the county assessor.

B. Assessments shall:

1. Be made on the entire railroad in this state as provided by subsection A.

2. Include the franchise, intangible values, right-of-way, roadbed, rolling stock, buildings and telecommunication lines and all other real and personal property used in operating the railroad.

#### Section 42-14355. Computing valuation; definitions

A. The department shall determine the valuation of a railroad as follows:

1. Determine the base value.

2. Compute the value change factor.

3. Compute the current year system full cash value by multiplying the base value determined under paragraph 1 of this subsection by the value change factor determined under paragraph 2 of this subsection.

4. Compute the allocation factor.

5. Multiply the current year system full cash value determined under paragraph 3 of this subsection by the allocation factor determined under paragraph 4 of this subsection.

6. Compute the Arizona full cash value by subtracting the Arizona licensed transportation equipment value from the value determined under paragraph 5 of this subsection.

B. For purposes of computing the valuation under this section:

1. The "allocation factor", used to assign a portion of the system value to this state, is computed by adding:

(a) The property factor, weighted by forty-seven per cent.

(b) The line haul factor, weighted by forty-four per cent.

(c) The terminal factor, weighted by nine per cent.

2. The "Arizona licensed transportation equipment value" is computed as follows:

(a) Subtract the system accumulated depreciation of motor vehicles that are subject to a license tax in lieu of an ad valorem property tax pursuant to article IX, section 11, Constitution of Arizona, from the system original cost of those vehicles.

(b) Divide the current year system full cash value, determined under subsection A, paragraph 3, by net operating property.

(c) Multiply the values determined in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this paragraph.

(d) Multiply the value determined in subdivision (c) of this paragraph by the allocation factor.

3. The "base value" is the final full cash value of the system in the preceding calendar year. If the system was not subject to valuation in this state in the preceding calendar year, the base value is the acquisition cost. If the system's ownership changes, the base value is unaffected and shall be transferred to the new owner.

4. The "capitalization rate" is the rate determined and reported by the interstate commerce commission in its annual cost of capital report.

5. The "change in capitalization rate" is computed by dividing the current year capitalization rate by the preceding year capitalization rate.

6. The "change in earnings" is computed by dividing the average earnings for the five years immediately preceding the current valuation year by the average earnings for the five years immediately preceding the previous valuation year. If three or more years of data are available, those data should be used, but if only one or two years of data are available, the change in earnings shall not be considered in computations under this section.

7. The "current gross profit margin" is computed by dividing the average earnings for the five years immediately preceding the current valuation year by the average gross revenues for the five years immediately preceding the current valuation year.

8. The "current return on investment" is computed by dividing the average earnings for the five years immediately preceding the current valuation year by the average net operating property for the five years immediately preceding the current valuation year.

9. The "current year efficiency" is computed by dividing the average earnings for the two years immediately preceding the current valuation year by the average gross revenues for the two years immediately preceding the current valuation year.

10. "Earnings" means the income realized before deducting interest, taxes, depreciation and lease expenses.

11. The "efficiency change factor" is computed by dividing the current year's efficiency factor by the previous year's efficiency factor.

12. The "efficiency factor" is computed by dividing earnings by gross revenues.

13. The "gross profit margin factor" is computed by dividing the current gross profit margin by the previous gross profit margin.

14. "Gross revenues" means total revenues from operations.

15. The "income change factor" is computed by dividing the change in earnings by the change in capitalization rate.

16. "Leased property" means noncapitalized leased operating property that is subject to an agreement that transfers the use of the property to the lessee during the term of the lease and that is not capitalized on the lessee's balance sheet.

17. The "line haul factor" is computed by dividing total revenue ton miles in this state by the total system revenue ton miles.

18. The "net operating property" is computed by subtracting accumulated depreciation and amortization including leased property from system cost.

19. "Operating property" means real or personal property that is owned or leased and used in operating the railroad, including land, track, right-of-way, buildings and structures, equipment, materials, tools and rolling stock.

20. The "previous gross profit margin" is computed by dividing the average earnings for the five years preceding the previous valuation year by the average gross revenues for the five years preceding the previous valuation year.

21. The "previous return on investment" is computed by dividing the average earnings for the five years preceding the previous valuation year by the average net operating property for the five years preceding the previous valuation year.

22. The "previous year efficiency" is computed by dividing the average earnings for the two years preceding the previous valuation year by the average gross revenues for the two years preceding the previous valuation year.

23. "Profitability change factor" means the average of the gross profit margin factor and the return on investment factor. If three or more years of data are available, those data should be used, but if only one or two years of data are available, the profitability change factor shall not be considered in computations under this section.

24. The "property change factor" is computed by dividing the system cost as of December 31 immediately preceding the current valuation year by the system cost as of December 31 immediately preceding the previous valuation year.

25. The "property factor" is computed by dividing the total original cost of operating property in this state, including leased property, by the system cost.

26. The "return on investment factor" is computed by dividing the current return on investment by the previous return on investment.

27. "Revenue ton mile" means the amount of revenue derived from the number of tons hauled over a distance of one mile.

28. "System cost" means the total original cost of all operating property, including leased property, in and outside this state.

29. The "terminal factor" is computed by dividing the sum of tons originating, terminating, received and delivered in this state by the sum of tons originating, terminating, received and delivered in the system.

30. The "value change factor" is computed by adding:

(a) The income change factor, weighted by fifty per cent.

(b) The profitability change factor, weighted by twenty per cent.

(c) The efficiency change factor, weighted by fifteen per cent.

(d) The property change factor, weighted by fifteen per cent, except that if the income change factor, efficiency change factor and profitability change factor do not apply, the property change factor is equivalent to the value change factor and is weighted at one hundred per cent.

#### Section 42-14356. Adjustments to achieve comparability

In attempting to accurately assess ongoing business operations, income and property, adjustment may be necessary to minimize differences. The overall objective is to achieve comparability in determining appropriate stabilized income and typical property changes from prior years. Occurrences that may prompt such an adjustment:

1. Are extraordinary, unusual and infrequent events.

2. Are material in nature, of a character different from the typical or customary business operations, not expected to recur frequently and not normally considered in evaluating the operating results of a business.

3. May include material increases or decreases in income and property as a result of such events as write-offs, write-downs and changes in accounting methods or practices.

2. A description of the whole of the assessed property in the county, city, town, school districts and special districts by metes and bounds or other description sufficient for identification.

B. The assessment and pro rata distribution shall be made with reference to the value of the property belonging to the company or corporation that owns the railroad located in each county, city, town, school district and special district through which the railroad extends.

C. If the railroad company lies in several counties:

1. Its rolling stock shall be apportioned among them so that a portion of the rolling stock may be assessed in each county.

2. Each county's portion shall bear to the whole rolling stock the same ratio that the number of miles in that county bears to the whole number of miles located in this state.

#### Section 42-14358. Entering statement on assessment roll

A. The board of supervisors of each county shall enter the statement and description provided by the department on the county assessment roll under appropriate columns with the total value of the assessed property carried out.

A. The department shall determine the valuation of all real and personal property of an airport fuel delivery company as follows:

1. Determine the base value.

2. Compute the asset change factor.

3. Multiply the base value by the asset change factor to compute the preliminary system value. If the asset change factor does not apply, the preliminary system value is the system net book value of plant in service as of December 31 immediately preceding the current valuation year.

4. Add the value of construction work in progress, materials and supplies and noncapitalized leased operating property to the preliminary system value.

5. Compute the allocation factor.

6. Multiply the sum computed pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subsection by the allocation factor.

B. In this section, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Allocation factor" means the factor used to assign part of the system value to this state and is computed by dividing the total Arizona original cost of plant in service, materials and supplies, construction work in progress and noncapitalized leased operating property as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year by the corresponding total system original cost as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year.

2. "Asset change factor" means the ratio derived from dividing the system net book value of plant in service as of December 31 immediately preceding the current valuation year by the system net book value of plant in service as of December 31 immediately preceding the prior valuation year.

C. Within sixty days after receiving a notice of claim, the tax officer may file a written response to the taxpayer to either consent to or dispute the error and to state the grounds for disputing the error.

The board or court has jurisdiction to make any such correction.

B. If an administrative or judicial appeal is pending regarding the subject property, any alleged error that was already the subject of a notice of proposed correction under section 42-16252 or a notice of claim under section 42-16254 shall be adjudicated as part of the administrative or judicial appeal for the affected tax year without requiring the parties to exhaust their administrative appeal remedies under this article.

C. If a specific error involving a particular property is established by a final nonappealable ruling by a court of competent jurisdiction in favor of the party who brought the action, the error may be corrected as of the date the action was filed or as of the date a notice of claim or notice of proposed correction was filed pursuant to this article, whichever is earlier, but no additional assessment or refund for any period before that date is permitted.

D. This article does not authorize an independent review of the overall valuation or legal classification of property that is not the result of an error as defined in section 42-16251.

#### Section 42-16258. Correcting tax roll by county treasurer

A. After receiving the tax roll, if the county treasurer determines that any property is omitted from the roll, or has reason to believe that any personal property that is omitted from the roll has not been taxed in any other county for that year, the treasurer shall request the assessor to determine the valuation of the property.

B. The treasurer shall enter the valuation on the roll following the levies made and delivered by the county board of supervisors. The entries shall be designated as additional valuations, and the taxes so computed by the county treasurer are valid for all purposes.

### Article 2 - Primary Property Tax Levy Limits

#### Section 42-17051. Limit on county, municipal and community college primary property tax levy

A. In addition to any other limitation that may be imposed, a county, charter county, city, charter city, town or community college district shall not levy primary property taxes in any year in excess of an aggregate amount computed as follows:

1. Determine the maximum allowable primary property tax levy limit for the jurisdiction for the preceding tax year.

2. Multiply the amount determined in paragraph 1 of this subsection by 1.02.

3. Determine the assessed value for the current tax year of all property in the political subdivision that was subject to tax in the preceding tax year.

4. Divide the dollar amount determined in paragraph 3 of this subsection by one hundred and then divide the dollar amount determined in paragraph 2 of this subsection by the resulting quotient. The result, rounded to four decimal places, is the maximum allowable tax rate for the political subdivision.

5. Determine the finally equalized valuation of all property, less exemptions, appearing on the tax roll for the current tax year including an estimate of the personal property tax roll determined pursuant to section 42-17053.

6. Divide the dollar amount determined in paragraph 5 of this subsection by one hundred and then multiply the resulting quotient by the rate determined in paragraph 4 of this subsection. The resulting product is the maximum allowable primary property tax levy limit for the current year for all political subdivisions.

7. The allowable levy of primary property taxes for the current fiscal year for all political subdivisions is the maximum allowable primary property tax levy limit less any amounts required to reduce the levy pursuant to subsections B and C of this section.

B. Any monies that a political subdivision received from primary property taxation in excess of the sum of the amount of taxes collectible pursuant to section 42-15053, subsection G, paragraph 2 and the allowable levy determined under subsection A of this section shall be maintained in a separate fund and used to reduce the primary property tax levy in the following year. Monies that are received and that are attributable to the payment of delinquent taxes that were properly assessed in prior years shall not be applied to reduce the levy in the following year.

C. If, pursuant to section 41-1279.07, the auditor general determines that in any fiscal year a county has exceeded its expenditure limitation, the allowable levy of primary property taxes of the county determined under subsection A of this section shall be reduced in the fiscal year following the auditor general's hearing by the amount of the expenditures that exceeded the county's expenditure limitation.

D. The limitations prescribed by this section do not apply to levies made pursuant to article 5 of this chapter.

E. The levy limitation for a political subdivision is considered to be increased each year to the maximum permissible limit under subsection A of this section regardless of whether the county, city, town or district actually levies taxes in any year up to the maximum permissible amount.

F. For purposes of determining a county's levy limit under this article, remote municipal property, as defined in section 42-15251, is considered to be taxable property in the county.

#### Section 42-17052. Values furnished by county assessor and fire districts

A.

1. The finally equalized valuation of all property, less estimated exemptions, appearing on the tax roll for the current tax year to be used to fix, levy and assess the political subdivision's taxes.

D. On or before February 10 of the tax year, the governing board of each fire district shall transmit to the property tax oversight commission the total assessed value of all property annexed by the district in the preceding calendar year.

 

#### Section 42-17053. Estimate of personal property tax roll

A. When a tax rate is to be determined and taxes are levied, the county assessor shall make an estimate of the personal property to be added to the tax roll for purposes of computing the property tax rates pursuant to section 42-17151.

B. The estimate shall be at least equal to the prior year's taxable personal property value, except that if the assessor has verifiable information that an item or items on the personal property tax roll during the current tax year will not be in the county during the next tax year, the assessor shall not include that item or items in the estimate under this section.

 

 

#### Section 42-17054. Levy limit worksheet

#### Section 42-17057. Computing new levy limits in the case of county division or consolidation; election on revised levy limit

A. In the event of a division of a county into two or more new counties or the consolidation of counties, the property tax oversight commission shall determine the maximum allowable levy of primary property taxes in each new county for the first full fiscal year after the new county governments are established by:

1. Computing the maximum levy allowable for the fiscal year under section 42-17051 for the old county or counties, assuming no division or consolidation had occurred.
