In addition, the application shall identify any guarantors or any indebtedness of the applicant, and the department shall be provided, on request, with a statement from a certified public accountant certifying that the net worth of any guarantor or guarantors is at least equal to the amount of the unpaid indebtedness so guaranteed.  Applications for racing meetings operated by county fair racing associations are exempt from this paragraph.

5. A complete list of all management and concession contracts in effect at the time of the application, copies of which shall be furnished to the department on request.

C. Not less than ten days before the commencement of a commercial racing meeting, the permittee shall submit to the department a cash deposit in such amount, but not to exceed five thousand dollars, as the director deems necessary to insure payment of fees and the amount due the state as the percentage of pari-mutuel receipts payable to the state as prescribed by law. On termination of the racing meeting, the deposit shall be returned to the applicant, less any fees or pari-mutuel receipts remaining unpaid.

D. In addition to the cash deposit and before the issuance of a racing meeting permit, the applicant shall deposit with the department a bond payable to the state for the benefit of the state and any person covered by this section, in such amount, but not to exceed three hundred thousand dollars in the case of horse or harness racing meeting permittees, as the director deems necessary, with a surety or sureties to be approved by the department and the attorney general and conditioned in accordance with the following order of priorities:

1. That the permittee shall first faithfully pay to the state the percentage of the pari-mutuel receipts, as applicable, prescribed by law and all taxes due to the state.

2. That thereafter the permittee shall pay to the owner thereof all funds held by the permittee for the account of such owner, including purses won, if such owner is or has been licensed by the department.

3. That thereafter the permittee shall pay all salaries and wages due to the employees of such permittee in connection with the conduct of the racing meeting.

4. That thereafter the permittee shall pay all amounts due to the breeder of any horse for a breeder's award.

E. Any person, including the state, claiming against the bond may maintain an action at law against the permittee and the surety or sureties, and the surety or sureties may be sued on the bond in successive actions until the penal sum thereof is exhausted. If it appears that there is more than one claim on such bond or if it appears that the state may have an interest therein, the state or any other claimant may move the court in which such actions are filed to intervene or to consolidate such actions to determine the priority order of claims in accordance with subsection D of this section.  No suit may be commenced on the bond after the expiration of one year following the day of the closing of the racing meeting during which any act or failure to act giving rise to a claim against the bond shall arise.

F. The bond prescribed by this section shall be effective for the period of the racing permit granted by the commission, and the liability of the surety for all claims shall be limited to the face amount of the bond. If the surety desires to make payment without awaiting court action, the amount of any bond filed in compliance with this chapter shall be reduced to the extent of any payments made by such surety in good faith thereunder. Any such payment shall be based first on the priority of claim order as established by subsection D of this section and thereafter on the priority of the date the written claims are received by the surety before court action.

The permit shall be approved for a period of not more than three years. Any renewal of a permit shall be pursuant to subsection D of this section.

D. Except as provided by subsection C of this section, permits shall be renewed for successive periods of not more than three years unless the commission revokes the permit or refuses to renew the permit for any of the grounds enumerated in this section or section 5-108.03.

#### Section 5-108.01. Hearing on application for or renewal of original permit; notice of hearing; decisions of commission and director; appeal; transfer of permit

A. The commission shall hold a public hearing on an original application for a racing permit or renewal of a current racing permit under this article.  At least fifteen days' notice shall be given to all permittees holding a permit, and they may appear and be heard as parties in interest upon the hearing of an application.

C. The commission shall not approve an original permit to conduct a horse racing, harness racing or dog racing meeting at any place, enclosure or track not used for racing purposes pursuant to permits actually issued as authorized by law prior to February 1, 1971, unless before the beginning of construction or preparation of the place, enclosure or track the commission determines that each of the following applies:

E. If the owner or lessee of any place, enclosure or track used for racing purposes pursuant to permits issued as authorized by law on or before February 1, 1971 is obligated for any reason to abandon the use of the place, enclosure or track, the owner or lessee may transfer the use and rights to use the premises for racing purposes to any other location in the same county.

#### Section 5-108.02. Revocation of permits; penalties

E. When the grounds exist for the imposition of a civil penalty or revocation of a permit issued pursuant to this chapter the department may impose a civil penalty, not to exceed five thousand dollars per day nor more than a total of twenty-five thousand dollars, on the permittee in lieu of or in addition to revocation of the permit by the commission. The department in addition to any criminal penalties provided in this chapter may levy a civil penalty as to a permittee in an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars for violation of any provision of this chapter or rule or regulation adopted pursuant to this chapter which does not constitute grounds for revocation of a permit. All sums paid to the department pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the general fund.

#### Section 5-110. Racing days, times and allocations; emergency transfer; county fairs; charity days

 

(L21, Ch. 405, sec. 1)

 

A. Permits for horse or harness racing meetings shall be approved and issued for substantially the same dates allotted to permittees for the same type of racing during the preceding year or for other dates that permittees request, provided that, in the event there is a conflict in dates requested between two or more permittees in the same county for the same kind of racing, the permittee whose application is for substantially the same dates as were allotted to the permittee in the preceding year shall be entitled to have preference over other permittees. In the event two or more permittees have agreed that the dates to be allotted to each of them each year shall be alternated from one year to the next, the commission shall recognize their agreement and those permittees may be accorded preference over any other permittee as to those dates to be allotted to those permittees on an alternating basis. Except as otherwise provided, the commission shall allot dates to the respective permittees after giving due consideration to all of the factors involved and the interests of permittees, the public and this state.

B. The commission may require by the terms of any permit that the permittee offer such number of races during any racing meeting as the commission shall determine, provided that the permittee shall be permitted to offer at least the same number of races each day as offered in the prior year. The commission shall require each horse racing permittee to conduct for a period of thirty days a number of races equal to an average of at least two races for each day of racing exclusively for quarter horses. If, in the opinion of the commission, the permittee is offering acceptable quarter horse races but an honest effort is not being put forth to fill these races by the horsemen, the commission may rescind the two race per day quarter horse requirement.

C. Live racing and wagering on simulcast races shall be permissible in either daytime or nighttime. Unless otherwise agreed by written contract that is submitted to the department between all the permittees in the same county, there shall be no wagering on simulcast dog races before 4:15 p.m., mountain standard time, on the same day that there is live daytime horse or harness racing in any county in which commercial horse or harness racing has been conducted before February 1, 1971. The hours during which any other harness or horse racing is to be conducted shall be determined by the commission. The application for a permit shall state the exact days on which racing will be held and the time of day during which racing will be conducted.

D. If the commission determines that an emergency has obligated or may obligate a permittee to discontinue racing at a location, the commission may authorize the permittee to transfer racing for the number of days lost to any other location.

E. A racing meeting, when operated by a county fair racing association or under lease during the county fair to any individual, corporation or association, shall not come under the limitation placed on days of racing in this section.

F. The department shall be the judge of whether a county fair racing meeting is being operated pursuant to this section. A county fair racing meeting conducted by an individual, corporation or association, other than the properly authorized county fair racing association, shall come under the general provisions of this article the same as a commercial meeting.  Notwithstanding this subsection, a county fair racing meeting, whether conducted by a county fair racing association or by an individual, corporation or association other than a county fair racing association, is exempt from the requirement prescribed in section 5-111 to pay to the state a percentage of the pari-mutuel pool collected at the meeting.

G. The commission may allow a permittee, in addition to the days specified in this permit, to operate up to three racing days during any one meeting as charity days. From the amount deducted from the total handled in the pari-mutuel pool on charity days, the permittee shall deduct an amount equal to the purses and the cost of conducting racing on these days, and shall donate the balance to nonprofit organizations and corporations that benefit the general public, that are engaged in charitable, benevolent and other like work and that are selected by the permittee and approved by the department. In no event shall the amount given to charity from charity racing days be less than the amount that otherwise would have gone to this state as the state's share on a noncharity racing day.

H. Notwithstanding any other law, live dog racing shall not be conducted in this state after December 31, 2016.  This subsection does not apply to nonprofit organizations that host lure coursing or similar events that test a dog's ability, stamina and breeding or training for such events. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any dog racing permittee that offered live dog racing in 2016 or that has offered live dog racing in eight out of ten calendar years from 1980 to 1990 in counties that have a population of less than five hundred thousand persons shall be considered as operating a racetrack enclosure for all purposes under this article and shall not be authorized or required to conduct live racing as a condition of that permittee's racing permit. Any permittee qualified under this subsection may conduct advance deposit wagering, wagering at additional wagering facilities that are owned or leased by that permittee and wagering on telecasts of races conducted at racetrack enclosures within this state or at racetrack enclosures outside this state without offering live racing at that permittee's racetrack enclosure. On or before January 1, 2023, the department shall convert the permit of a dog racing permittee under this subsection to a permit for harness racing if the dog racing permittee meets the qualifications for a permit for harness racing.

#### Section 5-111. Wagering percentage to permittee and state; exemptions

A. The commission shall prescribe rules governing wagering on races under the system known as pari-mutuel wagering. Wagering shall be conducted by a permittee only by pari-mutuel wagering and only on the dates for which racing or dark day simulcasting has been authorized by the commission. Wagering for a licensed racing meeting shall be conducted by a commercial live-racing permittee only within an enclosure and, in counties having a population of less than five hundred thousand persons or at least one million five hundred thousand persons, at those additional facilities that are owned or leased by a permittee, that are approved by the commission and that are used by a permittee for handling wagering as part of the pari-mutuel system of the commercial live-racing permittee. In all other counties, wagering may also be conducted at additional facilities that are owned or leased by a commercial live-racing permittee who is licensed to conduct live racing in those counties or, until January 1, 2019, who has the consent of all commercial permittees currently licensed to conduct live racing in those counties, and that are used by a permittee for handling wagering and as part of the pari-mutuel system of the commercial live-racing permittee.  Beginning January 1, 2019, consent of commercial permittees licensed to conduct live racing in those counties is not required.  From and after December 31, 2016, any agreement concerning simulcasting that is executed between a permittee that conducted live dog racing in 2016 and a horse racing facility that is located in a county with a population of more than three million persons shall provide that twenty percent of the commission fee paid to a permittee that conducted live dog racing in 2016 under that agreement be distributed to the recognized horsemen's association that represents horsemen participating in race meets in this state. If the additional facilities have not been used for authorized racing before their use for handling wagering, a permittee shall not use the facilities for handling wagering before receiving approval for use by the governing body of the city or town, if located within the corporate limits, or by the board of supervisors, if located in an unincorporated area of the county. A permittee may televise any live or simulcast races received at the permittee's racing enclosure to the additional facilities at the times the races are conducted or received at the permittee's enclosure. For the purpose of section 5-110, subsection C only, a race on which wagering is permitted under this subsection shall be deemed to also occur at the additional facility in the county in which the additional facility is located, and shall be limited in the same manner as actual live racing in that county. For the purpose of subsection B of this section, the wagering at the additional facility shall be deemed to occur in the county in which the additional facility is located.

B. During the period of a permit for horse or harness racing, the permittee that conducts the meeting may deduct up to and including twenty-five percent of the total amount handled in the regular pari-mutuel pools and, at the permittee's option, may deduct up to and including thirty percent of the total amount handled in the exacta, daily double, quinella and other wagering pools involving two horses, and up to and including thirty-five percent of the total amount handled in the trifecta or other wagering pools involving more than two horses in one or more races. The amounts if deducted shall be distributed as prescribed in subsection C of this section and section 5-111.02 for horse or harness racing permittees.

C. During the period of a permit for horse or harness racing, the state shall receive two percent of the gross amount of the first one million dollars of the daily pari-mutuel pools and five percent of the gross amount exceeding one million dollars of the daily pari-mutuel pools.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the percentage paid by a permittee to the state does not apply to monies handled in a pari-mutuel pool for wagering on simulcasts of out-of-state races. The permittee shall retain the balance of the total amounts deducted pursuant to subsection B of this section. Of the amount retained by the permittee, minus the amount payable to the permittee for capital improvements pursuant to section 5-111.02, breakage distributed to the permittee pursuant to section 5-111.01 and other applicable state, county and city transaction privilege or other taxes, unless otherwise agreed by written contract, fifty percent shall be used for purses. Unless otherwise agreed by written contract, fifty percent of the revenues received by the permittee from simulcasting races as provided in section 5-112, net of costs of advertising, shall be utilized as a supplement to the general purse structure. All amounts that are deducted from the pari-mutuel pool for purses pursuant to this section and sections 5-111.01, 5-112 and 5-114 and revenues that are received from simulcasting and that are to be used as a supplement to the general purse structure pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited daily into a trust account for the payment of purse amounts.

D. Any county fair racing association may apply to the commission for one racing meeting each year and the commission shall set the number of days and the dates of the meetings. A racing meeting conducted under this subsection shall be operated in such manner so that all profits accrue to the county fair racing association, and the county fair racing association may deduct from the pari-mutuel pool the same amount as prescribed in subsection B of this section. All county fair racing meetings, whether conducted by county fair racing associations under this subsection or by an individual, corporation or association other than a county fair racing association, are exempt from the payment to the state of the percentage of the pari-mutuel pool prescribed by subsection C of this section and are also exempt from the provisions of section 5-111.01.

E. Monies from charity racing days are exempt from the state percentage of the pari-mutuel pool prescribed in this section.

F. Sums held by a permittee for payment of unclaimed pari-mutuel tickets are exempt from the revised Arizona unclaimed property act, title 44, chapter 3.

G. All of the amounts received by a permittee from the gross amount of monies handled in a pari-mutuel pool and all amounts held by a permittee for payment of purses pursuant to this section and sections 5-111.01, 5-112 and 5-114 are exempt from the provisions of title 42, chapter 5.

 

#### Section 5-111.01. Breakage; definition; tax; disposition

A. The term "breakage" means the odd cents by which the amount payable on each dollar wagered in a pari-mutuel pool exceeds a multiple of ten cents, except that in the case of minus pools breakage means the odd cents by which the amount payable exceeds a multiple of five cents. A person licensed under this chapter to conduct a racing meeting shall deduct the breakage from the pari-mutuel pool and such amounts shall be distributed as provided by law.

#### Section 5-111.02. Capital improvements at horse tracks; reduction in percentage to state; approval by commission; definition

A. To encourage the improvement of racing facilities for the benefit of the public, breeders and horse owners, and to increase the revenue to the state from the increase in pari-mutuel wagering resulting from such improvements, the percentage paid by a permittee to the state as provided in section 5-111, subsection C shall be reduced by one percent of the total amount wagered in connection with all racing meetings conducted in counties having a population of five hundred thousand persons or more and by two percent of the total amount wagered in connection with all racing meetings conducted in all other counties for those permittees who make capital improvements to racetracks and such amount shall be retained by the permittees making such capital improvements. When a permittee other than the permittee making the capital improvements, such as a lessee, is authorized to conduct racing at the facility being improved, the percentage paid by such permittee to the state as provided in section 5-111, subsection C shall be reduced by one percent of the total amount wagered and such amount shall be paid by such permittee to the permittee making the capital improvements.

B. In order to qualify for the reduction in percentage, a permittee shall first apply to the commission in such form as the commission may require. The application shall contain, but is not limited to, full details of the proposed capital improvement and the cost and expenses to be incurred, economic justification for approval of the application by an estimate of the additional pari-mutuel revenues accruing to this state as the result of the proposed capital improvement, a description of any public safety concerns to be resolved by the proposed capital improvement and a management and construction plan for the indicated capital improvement, including:

1. The approach and structure of construction management.

2. Construction schedules and detailed cost estimates.

3. Construction progress and cost revision reporting systems.

C. More than one capital improvement at a horse track may be consolidated in one application. Following receipt of the application the commission shall either approve or disapprove the application within forty-five days thereafter and shall, within ten days after taking action on the application, transmit a copy of the application and notification of the action taken by the commission on the application to the president of the senate and speaker of the house of representatives. If the application submitted by the permittee is approved by the commission, the permittee qualifies for the decrease in percentage prescribed by subsection A of this section. The commission shall not approve an application submitted pursuant to this subsection unless the commission determines that the capital improvement will promote the safety of racing horses or increase the safety, convenience or comfort of the people and is in the best interest of horse racing and this state generally. If the commission approves an application submitted pursuant to this section, the director shall conduct periodic inspections of the capital improvement at least monthly during the construction period of the capital improvement in order to ascertain compliance with the permittee's application. In the event that such approved project has not commenced within one year following approval by the commission, unless such period is extended by the commission, the funds not expended pursuant to the approval of the commission shall revert to the general fund of the state and a decrease in the percentage paid to this state by reason of the approval of the commission shall terminate. The commission may suspend or revoke the authority of the permittee to expend capital improvement monies for failure to comply with the capital improvement application approved pursuant to subsection B of this section. The permittee shall notify the commission of the completion of construction on each capital improvement authorized pursuant to subsection B of this section.

D. Except as provided in subsection H of this section, the decrease in percentage paid to this state by the permittee pursuant to this section starts from the date horse racing is first conducted following the date of approval by the commission of the permittee's application for the funding of a capital improvement at the horse track and continues until sufficient funds have been obtained for completion of the capital improvement approved by the commission.

E. Following commission approval of an application for funding of a capital improvement at a horse track pursuant to this section, the permittee shall set aside in a separate capital improvement escrow or trust account all monies retained from the decrease in the state's share. The monies in the account and any interest on the monies may be used only for the capital improvement previously approved by the commission. The permittee shall provide to the commission quarterly reports on a form prescribed by the director that show for the previous calendar quarter:

1. Payments to and expenditures from each capital improvement or trust account established pursuant to this section.

2. The progress of construction on the capital improvement approved by the commission.

F. The cost of a capital improvement shall be determined by generally accepted accounting principles and verified on completion of the project by an audit of the permittee's records conducted by the auditor general acting at the instructions of the commission or an independent certified public accountant selected by the permittee and approved by the commission.

G. In this section, unless the context otherwise requires, "capital improvement" means an addition, replacement or remodeling of a racetrack facility involving an expenditure of at least fifty thousand dollars. Capital improvement also includes architectural and design expenses directly related to such addition, replacement or remodeling, whether incurred before or after project approval by the commission. Capital improvement does not include the cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance required to keep a racetrack facility in ordinary operating condition and does not include operational expenses, but may include the direct acquisition of water trucks and tractors.

H. In counties with a population of less than five hundred thousand persons, a decrease in the percentage paid to this state by the permittee pursuant to this section shall not begin until from and after June 30, 1995.

I. This section expires on June 30, 1992 for counties with a population of five hundred thousand persons or more. This section expires on June 30, 1999 for counties with a population of less than five hundred thousand persons. Projects approved prior to either of these dates may continue until their completion under the terms of this section and the decrease in percentage paid to the state by the permittee shall continue until sufficient funds have been obtained for completion of the approved capital improvement.

 

#### Section 5-111.04. Repayment of nonapproved expenditures of capital monies; judicial review

A. If it is determined by the commission, through the findings of the commission or through information provided to the commission by the department or the auditor general, that a permittee has retained monies for approved capital improvements pursuant to section 5-111.02 in excess of the amount approved for such capital improvements, the permittee shall repay the excess amount to this state within one year after notification of the determination by the commission. The commission shall determine the repayment method, and the repayment may be made directly by the permittee or through reductions in future entitlements for capital improvements which have been approved by the commission. This section shall not prohibit the use of capital expenditure monies received pursuant to section 5-111.02 for repayment of obligations of the permittee which directly relate to approved capital improvements.

B. Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, final decisions of the commission are subject to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

B. The department, on request by a permittee, may grant permission for electronically televised simulcasts of horse, harness or dog races to be received by the permittee. In counties with a population of one million five hundred thousand persons or more, the simulcasts shall be received at the racetrack enclosure where a horse or harness racing meeting is being conducted, provided that the simulcast may only be received during, immediately before or immediately after a minimum of nine posted races for that racing day. In counties with a population of five hundred thousand persons or more but less than one million five hundred thousand persons, the simulcasts shall be received at the racetrack enclosure where a horse or harness racing meeting is being conducted provided that the simulcast may only be received during, immediately before or immediately after a minimum of four posted races for that racing day. In all other counties, the simulcasts shall be received at a racetrack enclosure at which authorized racing has been conducted, whether or not posted races have been offered for the day the simulcast is received.  The simulcasts are limited to horse, harness or dog races.  The simulcasts are limited to the same type of racing as authorized in the permit for live racing conducted by the permittee. The department, on request by a permittee, may grant permission for the permittee to transmit the live race from the racetrack enclosure where a horse or harness racing meeting is being conducted to a facility or facilities in another state.  All simulcasts of horse or harness races shall comply with the interstate horseracing act of 1978 (P.L. 95-515; 92 Stat. 1811; 15 United States Code chapter 57).  All forms of pari-mutuel wagering are allowed on horse, harness or dog races, whether or not televised by simulcasting.  All monies wagered by patrons on these horse, harness or dog races shall be computed in the amount of money wagered each racing day for the purposes of section 5-111.

C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, in counties with a population of one million five hundred thousand persons or more, simulcasts may be received at the racetrack enclosure, and the permittee may offer pari-mutuel wagering on the simulcast racing at any additional wagering facility used by a permittee for handling wagering as provided in section 5-111, subsection A during a permittee's racing meeting as approved by the commission, whether or not the simulcasts are televised to the additional wagering facilities and whether or not posted races have been conducted on the day the simulcast is received, if the permittee's racing permit requires the permittee to conduct a minimum of one hundred fifty-six days of live racing with an average of nine posted races on an average of five racing days each week at the permittee's racetrack enclosure during the period beginning on October 1 and ending on the first full week in May, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the permittee and the recognized horsemen's organization that represents the horsemen participating in the race meet at the racetrack enclosure, subject to approval by the department.

D. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, in counties with a population of seven hundred thousand persons or more but less than one million five hundred thousand persons, simulcasts may be received at the racetrack enclosure, and the permittee may offer pari-mutuel wagering on the simulcast racing at any additional wagering facility used by a permittee for handling wagering as provided in section 5-111, subsection A during a permittee's racing meeting as approved by the commission, whether or not the simulcasts are televised to the additional wagering facilities and whether or not posted races have been conducted on the day the simulcast is received. The permittee may conduct wagering on dark day simulcasts for twenty days, provided the permittee conducts a minimum of seven posted races on each of the racing days mandated in the permittee's commercial racing permit. In order to conduct wagering on dark day simulcasts for more than twenty days, the permittee is required to conduct a minimum of seven posted races on one hundred forty racing days at the permittee's racetrack enclosure, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the permittee and the recognized horsemen's organization that represents the horsemen participating in the race meet at the racetrack enclosure, subject to approval by the department.

E. In an emergency and on a showing of good cause by a permittee, the commission may grant an exception to the minimum racing day requirements of subsections C and D of this section.

F. The minimum racing day requirements of subsections C and D of this section shall be computed by adding all racing days, including any county fair racing days operated in accordance with section 5-110, subsection F, allotted to the permittee's racetrack enclosure in one or more racing permits.

G. Simulcast signals or teletracking of simulcast signals does not prohibit live racing or teletracking of that live racing in any county at any time.

H. Except as provided in subsection J of this section, section 5-101.01, subsection F and title 13, chapter 33, any person within a racetrack enclosure or an additional facility authorized for wagering pursuant to section 5-111, subsection A may wager on the results of a race televised to the facility pursuant to section 5-111, subsection A by contributing to a pari-mutuel pool operated as provided by this article.

L. Simulcasting may only be authorized for the same type of racing authorized by a permittee's live racing permit.

M. In addition to pari-mutuel wagering otherwise authorized by this chapter, a commercial live-racing permittee or a commercial dog racing permittee that conducted live dog racing in 2016 may conduct advance deposit wagering as approved by the commission. The commission also may allow advance deposit wagering by an advance deposit wagering provider if a racing authority in the state where the advance deposit wagering provider is located approves the advance deposit wagering provider and, for horse racing, if the advance deposit wagering provider annually secures the approval of the commercial live horse racing permittees in a county where the advance deposit wagering provider or commercial live-racing permittee accepts advance deposit wagers for horse racing and of the organization that represents the majority of owners and trainers at each of the commercial live horse racing enclosures in each county. An advance deposit wagering provider that the commission approves shall pay source market fees on wagers placed on horse racing from this state to commercial live horse racing permittees in this state.

3. An advance deposit wagering provider shall pay source market fees in an amount that is agreed to by the commercial live-racing permittee on all advance deposit wagering by persons in this state on the same type of racing the commercial live-racing permittee conducts. Source market fees from wagers by persons in this state through an advance deposit wagering provider shall be allocated as provided in paragraph 7 of this subsection to a commercial live horse racing permittee at a racetrack enclosure in a county where live horse racing has been conducted for a period of at least forty days per year for at least twelve consecutive years beginning after 1992 or at a new racetrack enclosure in the same county that replaced the previously existing racetrack enclosure during the period of time that the commercial live-racing permittee conducts a racing program.

4. Advance deposit wagering agreements that are executed between permittees in this state must contain the same or substantially equivalent terms and conditions, including provisions for revenue sharing, as the terms and conditions contained in simulcasting agreements that are executed between those same permittees in order to accept advance deposit wagering on horse racing from a county with a commercial dog racing permittee.

5. The advance wagering provider shall transmit daily a percentage determined by the department of the gross revenues generated by advance deposit wagers to the department for deposit in the racing regulation fund established by section 5-113.01.

6. The advance deposit wagering provider shall file the consent provided for in this subsection with the commission, and the consent is valid for a period of at least one year.

7.

All reasonable costs associated with the creation, provision and transfer of the data is the responsibility of the advance deposit wagering provider.

Q.

F. In a trial, action or proceeding for a violation of this section or section 5-396 other than a trial, action or proceeding involving operating or being in actual physical control of a commercial motorized watercraft, the defendant's alcohol concentration within two hours of the time of operating or being in actual physical control as shown by analysis of the defendant's blood, breath or other bodily substance gives rise to the following presumptions:

1. If there was at that time 0.05 or less alcohol concentration in the defendant's blood, breath or other bodily substance, it may be presumed that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

2. If there was at that time in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08 alcohol concentration in the defendant's blood, breath or other bodily substance, such fact shall not give rise to any presumption that the defendant was or was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.

3. If there was at that time 0.08 or more alcohol concentration in the defendant's blood, breath or other bodily substance, it may be presumed that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

G. Subsection F of this section shall not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing on the question of whether or not the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

H. If a blood test is administered, only a physician, a registered nurse or another qualified person may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or drug content. The qualifications of the individual withdrawing the blood and the method used to withdraw the blood are not foundational prerequisites for the admissibility of any blood alcohol content determination made pursuant to this subsection.

I. If a law enforcement officer administers a duplicate breath test and the person tested is given a reasonable opportunity to arrange for an additional test pursuant to subsection J of this section, a sample of the person's breath does not have to be collected or preserved.

J. The person tested shall be given a reasonable opportunity to arrange for any physician, registered nurse or other qualified person of the tested person's own choosing to administer a test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.

K. If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a test or tests under section 5-395.03, whether or not a sample was collected pursuant to subsection L of this section or a search warrant, evidence of refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action or other proceeding. The issue of refusal shall be an issue of fact to be determined by the trier of fact in all cases.

L. Notwithstanding any other law, if a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a person has violated this section and a sample of blood, urine or any other bodily substance is taken from that person for any reason a portion of that sample sufficient for analysis shall be provided to a law enforcement officer if requested for law enforcement purposes.  A person who fails to comply with this subsection is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.

M. A person who collects blood, urine or any other bodily substance under this section or any hospital, laboratory or clinic employing or using the services of the person does not incur any civil liability as a result of this activity if requested by a law enforcement officer to collect blood, urine or any other bodily substances unless the person, while performing the activity, acts with gross negligence.

N. A statement by the defendant that the defendant was operating a motorized watercraft that was underway and that was involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person is admissible in any criminal proceeding without further proof of corpus delicti if it is otherwise admissible.

O. At the arraignment, the court shall inform the defendant that the defendant may request a trial by jury and that the request, if made, shall be granted.

P. For the purposes of this section, "alcohol concentration" means grams of alcohol per one hundred milliliters of blood or grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of breath.

(10) Compact enforcement; effect on transfer agreements.  If the tribe acquires gaming device operating rights under a transfer agreement, no dispute between the state and the other party to the transfer agreement shall affect the tribe's rights under the transfer agreement or the tribe's obligations to make the payments required under the transfer agreement.  If the tribe transfers gaming device operating rights under a transfer agreement, no dispute between the state and the other party to the transfer agreement shall affect the tribe's rights under the transfer agreement or the obligations of the other party to the transfer agreement to make the payments required under the transfer agreement.  These provisions shall not apply to a dispute among the state and both parties to a transfer agreement regarding the validity of a transfer agreement or to a dispute between the parties to a transfer agreement regarding a breach of the transfer agreement.

(12) Transfer and acquisition of pooled gaming devices.

(a) The tribe is authorized to join with other Indian tribes to periodically establish a pool to collect gaming device operating rights from Indian tribes that desire to transfer gaming device operating rights and transfer them to Indian tribes that desire to acquire gaming device operating rights. If the tribe is operating all of its current gaming device allocation and, after making reasonable efforts to do so, the tribe is not able to acquire additional gaming devices pursuant to an agreement described in section 3(d)(2), the tribe may acquire additional gaming devices up to the number specified in the table for the tribe from a transfer pool under procedures agreed to by Indian tribes participating in the transfer pool and the state.

(b) The tribe and the state are authorized to establish a pooling mechanism, under procedures agreed to by the tribe and the state, by which the rights to operate gaming devices that are not in operation may be acquired by an Indian tribe through an agreement with the state.  If the tribe is operating all of its current gaming device allocation and, after making reasonable efforts to do so, the tribe is not able to acquire additional gaming devices pursuant to an agreement described in section 3(d)(2) or from any transfer pool established pursuant to section 3(d)(12)(a) within 90 days after the opening of a transfer pool established pursuant to section 3(d)(12)(a), the tribe may acquire additional gaming devices from the state up to the number specified in the table for the tribe at a price that is at least one hundred percent (100%) of the highest price paid to date for the transfer of at least one hundred (100) gaming device operating rights for a term of at least five (5) years.  The monies paid by an Indian tribe to acquire additional gaming devices under an agreement pursuant to this section 3(d)(12)(b) shall benefit Indian tribes that have the right to operate gaming devices that are eligible to be transferred and are not in operation.  The state shall provide Indian tribes that are eligible to enter into an agreement with the state pursuant to this section 3(d)(12)(b) the opportunity to participate in the pool pursuant to the procedures agreed to by the tribe and the state.

(c) Prior to agreeing to any procedures with any Indian tribe pursuant to sections 3(d)(12)(a) or (b), the state shall provide notice to the tribe of the proposed procedures.

Each poker table shall be limited to no more than ten (10) available player positions plus the dealer.  The tribe agrees that it will not operate card games outside of a gaming facility.

(2) Periodic increases in the number of card game tables.  The number of card game tables that the tribe is authorized to operate in each gaming facility shall be automatically increased (but not decreased), without the need to amend this compact on each five-year anniversary of the effective date, to the number that is equal to the number of card game tables the tribe is authorized to operate in each gaming facility set forth in section 3(e)(1) multiplied by the applicable population adjustment rate (with any fraction rounded up to the next whole number).

1. More class III gaming devices than the total number of that Indian tribe's current gaming device allocation in column (1) of the table, plus the number of that Indian tribe's additional gaming devices in column (2) of the table; or

2. More class III gaming devices than that Indian tribe's current gaming device allocation in column (1) of the table without acquiring gaming device operating rights pursuant to and in accordance with section 3(d); or

(c) The following remedies shall be available to the tribe to elect, as the tribe may determine in its sole discretion, from time to time:

1. The tribe shall automatically be entitled to a greater number of gaming device operating rights, without the need to amend this compact and without the need to acquire any gaming device operating rights under section 3(d).  The greater number of gaming device operating rights is the product of a ratio (which is the total number of class III gaming devices the other Indian tribe is in fact authorized or permitted to operate following the occurrence of any of the events specified in subsections (a) or (b) of this section 3(g)(1) divided by the total number assigned to the other Indian tribe under column (1) plus column (2) of the table) multiplied by the total number assigned to the tribe in column (1) plus column (2) of the table.  If the tribe is not listed on the table, then the ratio described in the previous sentence is multiplied by the tribe's total number of gaming devices authorized in the compact; and

2. The tribe shall automatically be entitled to immediately reduce its obligations to make contributions to the state under   Instead of the amounts payable under section 12(b), the tribe shall make quarterly contributions to the state equal to seventy-five hundredths of one percent (.75%) of its class III net win for the prior quarter.  This remedy will not be available after any Indian tribe with a new compact as defined in A.R.S. section 5-601.02(I)(6) enters its final renewal period as described in section 23(b)(3).

(2) Contribution terms.  If, during the term of this compact any other Indian tribe is authorized or permitted to operate gaming devices in the state and the terms of the other Indian tribe's obligation to make contributions to the state are more favorable to the other Indian tribe than the obligation of the tribe to make contributions to the state under the terms of section 12, then the tribe may elect to have section 12 automatically amended to conform to those more favorable terms.

(3) Additional class III gaming. Except as provided in section 3(g)(5), if during the term of this compact, any Indian tribe is authorized to operate:

(a) A form of class III gaming in the state that is not listed in section 3(a), then the tribe shall be entitled to operate the additional form of gaming that the other Indian tribe is authorized to operate, without the need to amend this compact.

(b) Blackjack on more card game tables per gaming facility than authorized under this compact, then the tribe shall be entitled to operate blackjack on the additional number of card game tables that the other Indian tribe is authorized to operate, without the need to amend this compact.

(4) Wager limits.  Except as provided in section 3(g)(5), if, during the term of this compact, any Indian tribe is authorized or permitted to operate in the state any class III gaming devices or card game tables with higher wager limits than the wager limits specified in section 3, then the tribe is also authorized to operate its gaming devices and/or card game tables with the same higher wager limits, without the need to amend this compact.

(5) Exceptions. The provisions of section 3(g) shall not be triggered:

(a) By the automatic periodic increases in:

(i) The current gaming device allocation provided in section 3(c)(4), or the resulting increase in the maximum device per gaming facility;

(c) By the provisions of a pre-existing compact as defined in A.R.S. section 5-601.02(I)(5).

(h) Additional gaming due to changes in state law with respect to persons other than Indian tribes.

(1) If, on or after May 1, 2002, state law changes or is interpreted in a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction or in a final order of a state administrative agency to permit either a person or entity other than an Indian tribe to operate gaming devices; any form of class III gaming (including video lottery terminals) that is not authorized under this compact, other than gambling that is lawful on May 1, 2002 pursuant to A.R.S. section 13-3302; or poker, other than poker that is lawful on May 1, 2002 pursuant to A.R.S. section 13-3302, then, upon the effective date of such state law, final judgment, or final order:

To the extent not previously provided, the tribal gaming office shall send a copy of its list on a monthly basis to the state gaming agency, along with detailed information regarding why the person has been barred and, to the extent available, the barred person's photograph, driver's license information, and/or fingerprints, to the extent these items are in the possession of the tribal gaming office.  The state gaming agency will establish a list which will contain the names, and to the extent available, photographs of, and other relevant information regarding, persons whose reputations, conduct, or criminal history is such that their presence within a gaming facility may pose a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare.  Such persons will be barred from all tribal gaming facilities within the state.  The tribe agrees that the state gaming agency may disseminate this list, which shall contain detailed information about why each person is barred, to all other tribal gaming offices.

2. Otherwise permitting a self-excluded person to engage in gaming activity in a gaming facility while on the list of self-excluded persons.

(j) Neither the tribe, the gaming facility operator, the tribal gaming office, nor any employee thereof shall be liable to any self-excluded person or to any other party in any proceeding, and neither the tribe, the gaming facility operator, nor the tribal gaming office shall be deemed to have waived its sovereign immunity with respect to any person for any harm, monetary or otherwise, which may arise as a result of disclosure or publication in any manner, other than a willfully unlawful disclosure or publication, of the identity of any self-excluded person or persons.

Utilities which are the sole available source of any particular service to a gaming facility are not required to be certified. A vendor licensed and regulated by another governmental agency may submit a supplement to the application on file with the other agency.  The state gaming agency may waive the requirement that a vendor be certified if it determines that certifying the vendor is not necessary to protect the public interest."

(v) The following provision shall replace the corresponding provisions in section 5 of the pre-existing compact:

"(p) State administrative process; certifications.  Any applicant for state certification agrees by making such application to be subject to state jurisdiction to the extent necessary to determine the applicant's qualification to hold such certification, including all necessary administrative procedures, hearings and appeals pursuant to the administrative procedures act, title 41, chapter 6, Arizona Revised Statutes and the administrative rules of the state gaming agency.

(q) Administrative process; licenses.

(1) Any person applying for licensure by the tribal gaming office acknowledges that by making such application, the state gaming agency, as set forth herein, may be heard concerning the applicant's qualifications to hold such license.  If the state recommends revocation, suspension, or denial of a license, and the tribal gaming office revokes, suspends, or denies the license based on the state gaming agency's recommendation, the person may appeal that action to the tribe, to the extent any such right exists.

(2) If the tribal gaming office takes any action with respect to a license despite a state recommendation to the contrary, the tribal gaming office shall afford the state an opportunity for a hearing before an appropriate tribal forum to contest the tribal gaming office licensing decision. The decision of the tribal forum shall be final, except as provided in section 5(q)(4).

(3) The tribal gaming office shall afford the state gaming agency the opportunity to be heard in an appropriate tribal forum on its recommendation to suspend or revoke the license of any person in the same manner as if the state gaming agency had recommended denial of the license in the first instance.

(4) Independent tribunal review of tribal forum.

(a) Tribunal appointment and process.  If the tribal forum upholds a decision not to follow a gaming employee license recommendation, the state gaming agency may appeal to an independent three member tribunal by providing written notice to the tribal gaming office within ten (10) days after receiving the tribal forum's decision.  Within twenty (20) days thereafter, the CPR or a similar dispute resolution service acceptable to the parties (the "dispute resolution service"), shall select the tribunal members, except that upon agreement by the parties, in lieu of selection by the dispute resolution service, each party may select a tribunal member, and the two members shall select a third member.  If, within five (5) days after their appointment, the tribunal members appointed by the parties have not agreed upon a third tribunal member, the dispute resolution service shall select the third member. All tribunal members, whether appointed by the dispute resolution service or the parties, shall be (a) impartial, (b) licensed by and in good standing with a state bar association, and (c) independent from the state, the state gaming agency, the tribe, and the tribal gaming office. The tribunal shall hold a hearing and issue its decision within ninety (90) days after the state gaming agency delivers its written notice of appeal to the tribal gaming office.

The tribunal's sole authority shall be to review the decision of the tribal forum and determine whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence based on the record as a whole. The tribunal's hearing shall be conducted in a fair and impartial manner.  The hearing shall be held on the administrative record presented to the tribal forum.  The tribunal's decision shall be final and not subject to further appeal or to section 15 dispute resolution procedures. If the tribunal determines the employee should not be licensed, the tribal gaming office shall promptly revoke the disputed license. The cost of the tribunal and the hearing shall be borne equally between the state and the tribe."

(vi) The following provision shall be added to section 7 of the pre-existing compact:

"(g) Compact compliance review.  The state gaming agency is authorized to conduct an annual, comprehensive compact compliance review of the gaming operation, gaming facilities, and the gaming activities of the gaming facility operator to monitor compliance with this compact, any amendments or appendices to this compact, and other agreements relating to this compact."

(vii) Section 12 of the pre-existing compact shall be replaced with the following:

The state agrees that the Arizona benefits fund shall be used for the purpose of administering the contributions made by the tribe to the state in accordance with the provisions of section 12(b).  All contributions to the state from the tribe pursuant to this section 12(c), and all contributions to the state from other Indian tribes that have entered into tribal-state gaming compacts with the state that contain similar provisions, shall be deposited in the Arizona benefits fund administered by the state gaming agency.  The state agrees to invest all monies in the Arizona benefits fund in accordance with A.R.S. section 35-313; monies earned from such investment may only be credited to the Arizona benefits fund.  The state agrees that contributions paid to the state by the tribe under this section 12(c) shall only be distributed as provided in A.R.S. section 5-601.02, as adopted by the people of the state at the November 5, 2002 election, and the state shall not impose any tax, fee, charge, or other assessment upon the tribe's gaming operations.

(2) Deposits to the Arizona commerce authority local communities fund established by A.R.S. section 41-1505.12.

(e) Contribution schedule.

(1) Tribal contributions pursuant to section 12(b) shall be paid quarterly to the state gaming agency, other than the amounts distributed or deposited to benefit cities, towns and counties under section 12(d).  The contributions shall be calculated based on the tribe's class III net win for each quarter of the gaming facility operator's fiscal year.  Contributions shall be made no later than twenty-five (25) days after the last day of each fiscal quarter.

(2) At the time each quarterly contribution is made, the tribe shall submit to the state gaming agency a report indicating the class III net win by gaming activity for the quarter, and the amounts paid under sections 12(c) and (d).

(viii) The following provisions shall replace the corresponding provisions, or be added to the provisions, as the case may be, in section 13 of the pre-existing compact:

"(b) Emergency service accessibility. The tribe shall require the gaming facility operator to make provisions for adequate emergency accessibility and service. Mutual aid and emergency response service agreements will be entered as needed with entities from the surrounding communities.

To accommodate investigations and intelligence sharing, the tribe will provide that a police officer holding current Arizona police officer standards and training (POST) certification is employed by the gaming facility operator, tribal gaming office, or tribal police department, and assigned to handle gaming-related matters when they arise. Intelligence liaisons will be established at the tribal police department or tribal gaming office and also at the state gaming agency.  There will be federal, tribal, and state cooperation in task force investigations.  The state gaming agency's intelligence unit will gather, coordinate, centralize, and disseminate accurate and current intelligence information pertaining to criminal and undesirable activity that may threaten patrons, employees, or assets of the gaming industry.  The state and the tribe will coordinate the use of resources, authority, and personnel of the state and the tribe for the shared goal of preventing and prosecuting criminal or undesirable activity by players, employees, or businesses in connection with tribal gaming facilities.  Violations of state criminal gambling statutes on tribal lands may be prosecuted as federal crimes in federal court."

(ix) Section 15 of the pre-existing compact shall be replaced with the following:

"  Dispute resolution

(a) Notice/negotiation.  If either the tribe or the state believes the other has failed to comply with the requirements set forth in this compact, or if a dispute arises as to the proper interpretation of those requirements, then either party may serve a written notice on the other identifying the specific provision or provisions of the compact in dispute and specifying in detail the factual bases for any alleged non-compliance and/or the interpretation of the provision of the compact proposed by the party providing notice.  Within ten (10) days following delivery of the written notice of dispute, the executive director of the tribal gaming office and the director of the state gaming agency shall meet in an effort to voluntarily resolve the compliance or interpretation dispute through negotiation.  If those negotiations fail to resolve the dispute, the executive director of the tribal gaming office, the director of the state gaming agency, and representatives designated by the governor of Arizona and the chairman of the tribe shall meet in a further effort to voluntarily resolve the dispute through further negotiation.

(b) Mediation.  If the tribe and the state are unable to resolve by negotiation any dispute regarding compliance with the requirements of the compact, or the proper interpretation of those requirements, within thirty (30) days after delivery of the written notice of dispute, the tribe and the state shall, upon the request of either party, endeavor to settle the dispute in an amicable manner by non-binding mediation administered by the CPR under its mediation procedures dated April 1, 1998 (unless otherwise agreed to by the parties), and the procedures set forth below.  Although the parties shall be required to participate in the mediation process if requested, a request for mediation shall not preclude either party from pursuing any other available remedy.

(1) Selection of mediator.  If the parties agree upon a mediator, that person shall serve as the mediator.  If the parties are unable to agree on a mediator within ten (10) days of a request for mediation, then the CPR (i) shall select an attorney from the CPR panel of distinguished neutrals to be the mediator or (ii) if requested by the parties, shall select the mediator from a list of potential mediators approved by the parties.

(2) Conduct of mediation.  The mediator shall control the procedural aspects of the mediation and shall be guided by the mediation procedures promulgated by the CPR.

(3) Costs of mediation.  The costs of mediation shall be borne equally by the parties, with one-half (1/2) of the expenses charged to the tribe and one-half (1/2) of the expenses charged to the state.

(c) Arbitration.  If the tribe and the state fail to resolve such a dispute regarding compliance with the requirements of the compact or the proper interpretation of those requirements through negotiation or mediation under sections 15(a) or (b) within thirty (30) days after delivery of the written notice of dispute, upon a demand by either party, the dispute shall be settled through binding arbitration at a neutral location and, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, the arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the rules, as modified by the following:

(1) Demand for arbitration.  No earlier than thirty (30) days after the delivery of the notice required under section 15(a), either party may serve on the other a written demand for arbitration of the dispute, in accordance with CPR rule 3.  The demand shall contain a statement setting forth the nature of the dispute and the remedy sought.  The other party shall file a notice of defense and any counterclaim within twenty (20) days, in accordance with CPR rule 3.  Failure to provide a notice of defense shall not delay the arbitration.  In the absence of a notice of defense, all claims set forth in the demand shall be deemed denied.

(2) Arbitrators. Unless the parties agree in writing to the appointment of a single arbitrator, the arbitration shall be conducted before a panel of three (3) arbitrators.  In the absence of an agreement to a single arbitrator, within twenty (20) days of the defending party's receipt of the demand, each party shall select an arbitrator. As soon as possible thereafter, but in no event more than forty (40) days following delivery of the demand, the party-appointed arbitrators shall discuss and select a third (3rd) arbitrator from the panel of distinguished neutrals, who shall chair the tribunal. Alternatively, if the parties have agreed upon a list of arbitrators acceptable to both parties, the CPR shall select the third (3rd) arbitrator from that list.  Unless the parties agree otherwise, at least one (1) of the arbitrators on the tribunal shall be an attorney or retired judge knowledgeable about the act, federal Indian law, and jurisdiction within Indian country. If the parties do not appoint an arbitrator with those qualifications, the party-appointed arbitrators or the CPR shall do so.  Once the tribunal is impaneled, there shall be no ex parte contact with the arbitrators, except for contacts with the office of the tribunal chair regarding scheduling or other purely administrative matters that do not deal with substantive matters or the merits of the issues.

(3) Selection of arbitrator(s) by the CPR. If a party fails to appoint an arbitrator, or if the party-appointed arbitrators have failed to appoint a third (3rd) arbitrator within the time period provided in section 15(c)(2), either party may request appointment of the arbitrator by the CPR. The request shall be made in writing and served on the other party.  CPR shall fill any vacancies on the tribunal within ten (10) days of a request in accordance with CPR rule 6.

(4) Neutrality of the arbitrators. All arbitrators shall be independent and impartial.  Upon selection, each arbitrator shall promptly disclose in writing to the tribunal and the parties any circumstances that might cause doubt regarding the arbitrator's independence or impartiality. Such circumstances may include, but shall not be limited to, bias, interest in the result of the arbitration, and past or present relations with a party or its counsel.  Following such disclosure, any arbitrator may be challenged in accordance with CPR rule 7.

(5) Cost of arbitration.  The costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties, with one-half (1/2) of the expenses charged to the tribe and one-half (1/2) of the expenses charged to the state.

(6) Preliminary conference/hearing. The tribunal shall hold an initial pre-hearing conference no later than thirty (30) days following the selection of the members of the tribunal and shall permit discovery and make other applicable decisions in accordance with CPR rules 9 through 12.  Unless the parties agree otherwise, or unless the tribunal determines that compelling circumstances exist which demand otherwise, the arbitration shall be completed within one hundred and eighty (180) days of the initial pre-hearing conference.

(7) Discovery.

(a) Documents.  Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will, upon the written request of the other party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by any claim or counterclaim or on which the producing party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense.  Except as permitted by the tribunal, all written discovery shall be completed within ninety (90) days following the initial pre-hearing conference. Any dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the tribunal, whose determination shall be conclusive.

(b) Depositions.  Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration and unless the parties agree otherwise, a party, upon providing written notice to the other party, shall have the right to take the depositions of up to five (5) witnesses, each of which shall last no longer than one (1) day.  Unless the parties agree otherwise, additional depositions shall be scheduled only with the permission of the tribunal and for good cause shown. A party's need to take the deposition of a witness who is not expected to be available for an arbitration hearing shall be deemed to be good cause.  Except as permitted by the tribunal, all depositions shall be concluded within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the initial pre-hearing conference.  All objections that might be raised to deposition testimony shall be reserved for the arbitration hearing, except for objections based on privilege, proprietary or confidential information, and objections to form or foundation that could be cured if raised at the deposition.

(8) Injunctive relief in aid of arbitration.  The tribe or the state may seek in a court of competent jurisdiction (a) provisional or ancillary remedies, including preliminary injunctive relief, pending the outcome of an arbitration proceeding, or (b) permanent injunctive relief to enforce an arbitration award.

(9) Arbitration hearing.

(a) Notice/transcript. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the tribunal shall provide the parties with at least sixty (60) days notice of the date of the arbitration hearing.  Unless the parties agree otherwise, there shall be a stenographic record made of the hearing, with the cost to be shared by the tribe and the state.  The transcript shall be the official record of the proceeding.

(b) Last, best offer format. The arbitrators shall conduct each arbitration proceeding using the "last, best offer" format, unless any party to an arbitration proceeding opts out of the "last, best offer" arbitration format in the manner set forth in section 15(c)(9)(c).

1. No later than forty (40) days before the arbitration hearing (or forty (40) days before the date the dispute is to be submitted to the tribunal for decision if oral hearings have been waived), each party shall submit to the other party or parties to the arbitration a preliminary last, best offer for those issues that will be decided using the last, best offer format.

2. No later than twenty (20) days before the arbitration hearing (or twenty (20) days before the date the dispute is to be submitted to the tribunal for decision if oral hearings have been waived), each party shall submit to the tribunal and the other party or parties to the arbitration its pre-hearing last, best offer for those issues that will be decided using the last, best offer format.

3. No later than ten (10) days after the conclusion of the arbitration hearing (or ten (10) days before the date the dispute is to be submitted to the tribunal for decision if oral hearings have been waived), each party shall submit to the tribunal and the other party or parties to the arbitration its final last, best offer for those issues that will be decided using the last, best offer format.

4. Except as otherwise provided in this section 15(c)(9)(b)(4), for each issue to be decided using the last, best offer format, the tribunal shall, for its decision on the issue, adopt one of the last, best offers submitted under section 15(c)(9)(b)(3) and no other remedy (excepting only remedies in aid of the tribunal's decision). If the tribunal expressly determines that a last, best offer submitted by a party with respect to an issue or issues is not consistent with or does not comply with the act and/or the compact, as they may be amended and as they are interpreted by courts of competent jurisdiction, then the tribunal shall reject that last, best offer and shall not consider it in rendering its decision. If the tribunal expressly determines that all the last, best offers submitted by the parties with respect to an issue or issues are not consistent with or do not comply with the act and/or the compact, as they may be amended and as they are interpreted by courts of competent jurisdiction, then the tribunal shall reject all the last, best offers and shall decide the related issue or issues as if the parties had elected to have the issue or those issues decided without using the "last, best offer" format.  In addition, the tribunal shall have no authority to award money damages against either party, regardless of whether a last, best offer proposes an award of damages.

(c) Opting out of last, best offer format.  Unless the parties agree otherwise, a party desiring to opt out of the "last, best offer" arbitration format shall serve a written notice of its election no later than fifty (50) days before the arbitration hearing (or fifty (50) days before the date the dispute is to be submitted to the tribunal for decision if oral hearings have been waived).  The notice shall:

1. Identify with specificity the issue or issues that the arbitrators will decide without using the "last, best offer" arbitration format, or

2. State that the arbitrators will not use the "last, best offer" arbitration format.

(10) Decision of the tribunal.  The decision of the tribunal shall be in writing, setting forth detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law and a statement regarding the reasons for the disposition of each claim.  If the tribunal determines that a last, best offer is not consistent with or does not comply with the act and/or the compact, the decision of the tribunal shall set forth detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law and a statement regarding the reasons for the tribunal's determination. The written decision of the tribunal shall be made promptly and, unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, no later than forty (40) days from the date of the closing of the hearing or, if oral hearings have been waived, no later than forty (40) days from the date the dispute is submitted to the tribunal for decision.  The tribunal may take additional time to render its decision if the tribunal determines that compelling circumstances require additional time.  The tribunal may issue awards in accordance with CPR rule 13, to the extent that rule is consistent with section 15(c).  The decision of the majority of the arbitrators shall be final, binding, and non-appealable, except for a challenge to a decision on the grounds set forth in 9 U.S.C. § 10. The failure to comply with a judgment upon the award of the arbitrators shall be a breach of this compact.

(11) Governing law/jurisdiction.  Title 9 of the United States Code (the United States arbitration act) and the rules shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of section 15(c), but nothing in section 15(c) shall be interpreted as a waiver of the state's tenth amendment or eleventh amendment immunity or as a waiver of the tribe's sovereign immunity.  The tribunal shall resolve the disputes submitted for arbitration in accordance with, and every decision of the tribunal must comply and be consistent with, the act and the compact, as they may be amended and as they are interpreted by courts of competent jurisdiction. The tribunal shall have no authority to award money damages against either party.

(12) Judicial confirmation. Judgment upon any award rendered by the tribunal may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction.

(d) Injunctive relief. The parties acknowledge that, although negotiation followed by mediation and arbitration are the preferred methods of dispute resolution, compact section 15 shall not impair any rights to seek in any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive relief pursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 2710(d)(7)(a)(ii), or a judgment upon an award rendered by an arbitration tribunal in accordance with sections 15(c)(10) and 15(c)(11). In an action brought by the tribe against the state, one court of competent jurisdiction is the Arizona superior court.  In an action brought by the state against the tribe, one court of competent jurisdiction is the United States district court for the district of Arizona.  Nothing in this compact is intended to prevent either party from seeking relief in some other court of competent jurisdiction, or to constitute an acknowledgement that the state courts have jurisdiction over the tribe or the tribal courts have jurisdiction over the state."

(x) Section 17 of the pre-existing compact shall be replaced with the following:

"  Amendments

(a) Proposed compact amendments.  To continue to ensure the fair and honest operation of Indian gaming, no later than one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date, the state or the tribe may propose amendments to enhance the following regulatory provisions of this compact:
