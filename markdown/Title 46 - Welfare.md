Investigate all cases for possible fraud or abuse when there is evidence or other reason to believe that income sources for an account holder's deposits were previously available to the account holder but undeclared during application or subsequent redetermination for assistance, or that individual contributions to an account should have been declared as income or child support payments or represent proceeds from illegal activities.

D. The individual development accounts shall be administered by a financial institution that is licensed by the department of insurance and financial institutions. These accounts shall earn interest at rates that are competitive with savings account rates.

Subject to the limitations prescribed in this section, deposits made into an individual development account and the account balance, including interest earned, shall be disregarded by the department in determining the account holder's and the assistance unit's eligibility for the cash assistance and food stamp programs as well as any other assistance or services in which eligibility for receipt is directly linked to eligibility for the cash assistance and food stamp programs. If an assistance unit with an individual development account experiences any break in eligibility for cash assistance, and then subsequently reapplies for either cash assistance or food stamp program benefits, the department shall consider any remaining account monies, unless otherwise excludable, as countable assets and shall not disregard, for purposes of eligibility in either program, future deposits into an individual development account.

The purpose of the individual development accounts is to provide an additional tool to assist beneficiaries to use during and after a stay on welfare, in order to help facilitate a permanent transition off of welfare programs and into self-sufficiency.

#### Section 46-444. Transfer of support rights; disbursement of support payments

A. In a title IV-D case in which an order of child support has been established and the obligee under the order surrenders physical custody of the child to a caretaker for thirty consecutive days, whether or not there is a custody order, the obligee's right to child support for that child transfers to the caretaker by operation of law and is subject to assignment by the caretaker pursuant to section 46-407.  The transfer of the right to child support terminates when the caretaker no longer has physical custody of the child, except for the amount of unpaid child support still owing to the caretaker or to the department.

B. The department may disburse child support payments to a caretaker who has had physical custody of the child for thirty consecutive days or physical custody with the obligee's consent for thirty consecutive days.  The department may not disburse monies that have already been disbursed to the obligee in the underlying order.  If the department makes disbursements pursuant to this subsection, the department shall begin disbursements on the first day of the month after the expiration of the thirty-consecutive-day period that started on the date the caretaker took custody of the child.

C. The department may retain child support payments assigned by the caretaker on verification that the caretaker is receiving cash assistance for a child subject to a support order and the child support payment is subject to an assignment pursuant to section 46-407.

E. Before the department disburses child support payments to any person other than the obligee, the department shall:

1. Obtain a written statement from the child's caretaker, under penalty of perjury, stating that the caretaker has had physical custody of the child for thirty consecutive days or custody with the obligee's consent for a period of thirty consecutive days.  A written statement is not required if there is a court order that places the child with the caretaker.

2. Mail a copy of the caretaker's statement or court order along with a notice of the change in disbursement to the obligor and obligee at the obligor's and obligee's last known addresses.

3. File a copy of the notice of change in disbursement with the clerk of the court that entered the original support order.

F. The obligee, the obligor or any other caretaker may object to the disbursement to the caretaker by requesting an administrative review pursuant to section 25-522 within ten days after the date of the notice.  The administrative review is limited to deciding if the caretaker has lawful physical custody of the child or physical custody with the obligee's consent.

G. If the obligee claims that the child remains in the obligee's custody, on a determination that the physical custody is with a caretaker, the department may distribute child support collected to the caretaker.

H. If the existing order for support is a non-title IV-D case, the department may enter its appearance in the case solely to transfer rights to support to a caretaker if both of the following are true:

1. Either the caretaker has applied for title IV-D services or the department has an assignment of rights pursuant to section 46-407.

That the obligee has ten days after the date of the notice to complete an authorization for automatic deposit form and return it to the department and that the department or its agent will issue an electronic access card for receipt of support payments unless the obligee claims a hardship exemption pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 3.

2. That a request for a hardship exemption must be in writing and include documentation that supports the request.

3. Information on the use and restrictions associated with the use of an electronic access card.

C. The department may authorize the generation of a payment by warrant if any of the following conditions applies:

1. Generation of a warrant is necessary to meet federal requirements and electronic transfer is not feasible.

2. The obligee is involved in legal proceedings that require payments to be sent to a trustee or representative payee.

3. The obligee has not requested automatic deposit to a designated account of the obligee and has asserted in writing that the use of an electronic access card will create an undue hardship because of a documented physical or mental disability.

D. The director may adopt rules to implement this section.
