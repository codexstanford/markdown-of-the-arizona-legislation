### Article 2 - Contract

#### Section 34-221. Contract with successful bidder; payments to contractor and design professional; security; recovery of damages for delay; progress payments; changed or additional work; attorney fees; definitions

A. The agent shall enter into a contract with the lowest responsible bidder whose proposal is satisfactory, except that in determining the lowest responsible bidder under this section, the board of supervisors may consider, for not more than five projects, the time of completion proposed by the bidder, the value over time of completed services and facilities and the value over time of interrupted services if the board determines that this procedure will serve the public interest by providing a substantial fiscal benefit or that the use of the traditional awarding of contracts is not practicable for meeting desired construction standards or delivery schedules and if the formula for considering the time of completion is specifically stated in the bidding information.

B. In determining the lowest responsible bidder for a horizontal construction project using the design-bid-build project delivery method, an agent may consider the time of completion proposed by the bidder if the agent determines that this procedure will serve the public interest by providing a substantial fiscal benefit or that the use of the traditional awarding of contracts is not practicable for meeting desired construction standards or delivery schedules and if the formula for considering the time of completion is specifically stated in the bidding information.

C. The terms of a contract entered into pursuant to subsection A of this section shall include the following items:

1. A surety company bond or bonds as required under this article.

2. The owner by mutual agreement may make progress payments on contracts of less than ninety days and shall make monthly progress payments on all other contracts as provided for in this paragraph. Payment to the contractor on the basis of a duly certified and approved estimate of the work performed during the preceding calendar month under such contract may include payment for material and equipment, but to ensure the proper performance of such contract, the owner shall retain ten percent of the amount of each estimate until final completion and acceptance of all material, equipment and work covered by the contract.  An estimate of the work submitted shall be deemed approved and certified for payment seven days after the date of submission unless before that time the owner or owner's agent prepares and issues a specific written finding setting forth those items in detail in the estimate of the work that are not approved for payment under the contract. The owner may withhold an amount from the progress payment sufficient to pay the expenses the owner reasonably expects to incur in correcting the deficiency set forth in the written finding. The progress payments shall be paid on or before fourteen days after the estimate of the work is certified and approved. The estimate of the work shall be deemed received by the owner on submission to any person designated by the owner for the submission, review or approval of the estimate of the work.

3. When the contract is fifty percent completed, one-half of the amount retained, including any securities substituted under paragraph 5 of this subsection, shall be paid to the contractor on the contractor's request if the contractor is making satisfactory progress on the contract and there is no specific cause or claim requiring a greater amount to be retained. After the contract is fifty percent completed, not more than five percent of the amount of any subsequent progress payments made under the contract may be retained if the contractor is making satisfactory progress on the project, except that if at any time the owner determines satisfactory progress is not being made, ten percent retention shall be reinstated for all progress payments made under the contract subsequent to the determination.

4. On completion and acceptance of each separate building, public work or other division of the contract on which the price is stated separately in the contract, except as qualified in paragraph 5 of this subsection, payment may be made in full, including retained percentages thereon, minus authorized deductions. In preparing estimates, the material and equipment delivered on the site to be incorporated in the job shall be taken into consideration in determining the estimated value by the architect or engineer.

5. Ten percent of all estimates shall be retained by the agent as a guarantee for complete performance of the contract, to be paid to the contractor within sixty days after completion or filing notice of completion of the contract. Retention of payments by a purchasing agency longer than sixty days after final completion and acceptance requires a specific written finding by the purchasing agency of the reasons justifying the delay in payment. A purchasing agency may not retain any monies after sixty days that are in excess of the amount necessary to pay the expenses the purchasing agency reasonably expects to incur in order to pay or discharge the expenses determined by the purchasing agency in the finding justifying the retention of monies. In lieu of the retention provided in this section, the agent, at the option of the contractor, shall accept as a substitute an assignment of money market accounts, demand deposit accounts, time certificates of deposit of banks licensed by this state, securities of or guaranteed by the United States of America, securities of this state, securities of counties, municipalities and school districts within this state or shares of savings and loan associations authorized to transact business in this state, in an amount equal to ten percent of all estimates, which shall be retained by the agent as a guarantee for complete performance of the contract. If the contractor opts for substitute security as described in this paragraph for the ten percent retention, the contractor is entitled to receive all interest or income earned by such security as it accrues, and all such security in lieu of retention shall be returned to the contractor by the agent within sixty days after final completion and acceptance of all material, equipment and work covered by the contract if the contractor has furnished the agent satisfactory receipts for all labor and material billed and waivers of liens from any and all persons holding claims against the work. The agent may not accept a money market account, a demand deposit account, a time certificate of deposit of a bank or shares of a savings and loan association in lieu of the retention specified unless accompanied by a signed and acknowledged waiver of the bank or savings and loan association of any right or power to setoff against either the agent or the contractor in relationship to the certificates or shares assigned. The amount deposited in a money market account or demand deposit account in lieu of the retention provided in this section shall not be released by the financial institution to the contractor except on written authorization of the agent.

6. If the agent has accepted substitute security as provided in paragraph 5 of this subsection, any subcontractor undertaking to perform any part of such public work is entitled to provide substitute security to the contractor on terms and conditions similar to those described in paragraph 5 of this subsection, and such security is in lieu of any retention under the subcontract.

D. A contract for construction or design professional services may not materially alter the rights of any contractor, subcontractor, design professional or material supplier to receive prompt and timely payment required to be included in the contract under subsection C of this section.

E. The contract shall be signed by the agent and the contractor.

F. A contract for the procurement of construction shall include a provision that provides for negotiations between the agent and the contractor for the recovery of damages related to expenses incurred by the contractor for a delay for which the agent is responsible, which is unreasonable under the circumstances and which was not within the contemplation of the parties to the contract. This section does not void any provision in the contract that requires notice of delays or provides for arbitration or other procedure for settlement or provides for liquidated damages.

G. The contractor shall pay to the contractor's subcontractors, design professionals or material suppliers and each subcontractor shall pay to the subcontractor's subcontractor, design professional or material supplier, within seven days after receipt of each progress payment, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, the respective amounts allowed the contractor, subcontractor or design professional on account of the work performed by subordinate subcontractors or design professionals, to the extent of each such subcontractor's or design professional's interest therein, except that a contract for construction may not materially alter the rights of any contractor, subcontractor, design professional or material supplier to receive prompt and timely payment as provided under this section. Such payments to subcontractors, design professionals or material suppliers shall be based on payments received pursuant to this section. Any diversion by the contractor or subcontractor of payments received for work performed on a contract, or failure to reasonably account for the application or use of such payments, constitutes grounds for disciplinary action by the registrar of contractors. The subcontractor or material supplier shall notify the registrar of contractors and the purchasing agency in writing of any payment that is less than the amount or percentage approved for the class or item of work as set forth in this section.

H. A subcontractor or design professional may notify the purchasing agency in writing requesting that the subcontractor or design professional be notified by the purchasing agency in writing within five days after payment of each progress payment that is made to the contractor. The subcontractor's or design professional's request remains in effect for the duration of the subcontractor's or design professional's work on the project.

I. This chapter does not prevent the contractor or subcontractor, at the time of application and certification to the owner or contractor, from withholding such application and certification to the owner or contractor for payment to the subcontractor, design professional or material supplier for unsatisfactory job progress, defective design professional services or construction work or materials not remedied, disputed design professional services, work or materials, third-party claims filed or reasonable evidence that a claim will be filed, failure of a subcontractor or design professional to make timely payments for design professional services, labor, equipment and materials, damage to the contractor or another subcontractor or design professional, reasonable evidence that the subcontract or design professional service contract cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract or design professional service contract sum or a reasonable amount for retention that does not exceed the actual percentage retained by the owner.

J. If any payment to a contractor is delayed after the date due, interest shall be paid at the rate of one percent per month or fraction of a month on such unpaid balance as may be due.

K. If any periodic or final payment to a subcontractor or design professional is delayed by more than seven days after receipt of the periodic or final payment by the contractor or subcontractor, the contractor or subcontractor shall pay a subordinate subcontractor, design professional or material supplier interest, beginning on the eighth day, at the rate of one percent per month or a fraction of a month on such unpaid balance as may be due.

L. If the owner directs the contractor in writing to perform changed or additional work in accordance with the construction contract and the contractor submits to the owner a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract, pending a final determination of the total amount to be paid for the changed or additional work, the contractor may request payment for changed or additional work that the contractor completed during the preceding calendar month in monthly pay estimates based on the costs the contractor incurred to perform that work.  The person designated in the construction contract to certify and approve the monthly payment estimate shall make an interim determination for purposes of approval for payment of those costs and certify for payment the amount that person determines to be reasonably justified.  Either party may disagree with the interim determination and may assert a claim in accordance with the terms of the construction contract.

M. If the owner directs the contractor in writing to perform changed or additional work in accordance with the construction contract and the contractor submits to the owner a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract and if the contractor directs the subcontractor to perform the changed or additional work in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the contractor and subcontractor and the subcontractor submits to the contractor a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract, pending a final determination of the total amount to be paid for the changed or additional work, the subcontractor may request payment from the contractor for the changed or additional work that the subcontractor completed during the preceding calendar month in monthly pay estimates based on the costs the subcontractor incurred to perform that work.  Either party may disagree with the interim determination and may assert a claim in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the contractor and subcontractor.

N. In any action or arbitration brought pursuant to this section, the successful party shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs.

O. For the purposes of this section:

1. Contractor does not include an agricultural improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 17, an electric cooperative formed pursuant to title 10, chapter 19, article 2 or 4 or a domestic water improvement district or a domestic wastewater improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 6, article 4.

(iii) If a person or firm on the final list withdraws or is removed from the procurement and the selection committee determines that it is in the best interest of the agent, the selection committee may replace that person or firm on the final list with another person or firm that submitted qualifications in the procurement and that is selected by the selection committee as the next most qualified.

2. An agent shall issue a request for qualifications for each procurement and publish notice of the request for qualifications. This notice shall be published by advertising in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the agent is located for two consecutive publications if it is a weekly newspaper or for two publications that are at least six but no more than ten days apart if it is a daily newspaper. The request for qualifications shall:

(c) As prescribed below, state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used by the selection committee, except that for construction services one of the criteria shall be the person's or firm's subcontractor selection plan or procedures to implement the agent's subcontractor selection plan. All selection criteria under this subsection shall be factors that demonstrate competence and qualifications for the type of professional services or construction services included in the procurement.  If:

(i) Interviews will be held, the request for qualifications shall state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms to be interviewed and the request for qualifications may state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms on the final list and in determining their order on the final list.  The final list selection criteria and relative weights may be different than the selection criteria and relative weights used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.  The request for qualifications shall also state whether the agent will select the persons or firms on the final list and their order on the final list solely through the results of the interview process or through the combined results of both the interview process and the evaluation of statements of qualifications and performance data submitted in response to the agent's request for qualifications.

(g) In a procurement of construction-manager-at-risk construction services or design-build construction services to be performed at multiple locations, include:

(i) A brief description of the construction services to be performed at each location.

(ii) The estimated budget for the construction services to be performed at each location.

3. An agent shall initiate an appropriately qualified selection committee for each request for qualifications. The agent shall ensure that the selection committee members are competent to serve on the selection committee.  Each selection committee must include one employee of the agent or an agent representative who is appointed by the agent.  If the agent is procuring professional services, the agent shall determine the number and qualifications of the selection committee members. A selection committee for the procurement of construction services shall not have more than seven members, except that, if the contract involves the agent and additional governmental or private participants, the number of members of the selection committee shall be increased by one for each additional participant, except that the maximum number of members of the selection committee is nine. The selection committee for construction services shall include at least one person who is a senior management employee of a licensed contractor and one person who is an architect or an engineer who is registered pursuant to section 32-121. These members may be employees of the agent or outside consultants. Outside contractors, architects and engineers serving on a selection committee shall not receive compensation from the agent for performing this service, but the agent may elect to reimburse outside contractors, architects and engineers for travel, lodging and other expenses incurred in connection with service on a selection committee. A person who is a member of a selection committee shall not be a contractor under a contract awarded under the procurement or provide any professional services, construction, construction services, materials or other services under the contract.  The selection committee and the agent shall do the following:

(a) If interviews are specified in the request for qualifications:

(i) The selection committee shall determine the persons or firms to be interviewed by evaluating the statements of qualifications and performance data that are submitted in response to the agent's request for qualifications based only on the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria stated in the request for qualifications to be used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.

(ii) If the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used by the selection committee to select the persons or firms on the final list and to determine their order on the final list are not included in the request for qualifications, before the interviews are held the agent shall distribute to the persons or firms to be interviewed the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used to select the persons or firms on the final list and to determine their order on the final list. These selection criteria and relative weight may be different than the selection criteria and relative weight used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.

4. If the agent is not able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the highest qualified person or firm on the final list, at compensation and on other contract terms the agent determines to be fair and reasonable, the agent shall formally terminate negotiations with that person or firm.  The agent shall then undertake negotiations with the next most qualified person or firm on the final list in sequence until an agreement is reached or a determination is made to reject all persons or firms on the final list.

5. If in a procurement under this section the agent terminates negotiations with a person or firm on the final list and commences negotiations with another person or firm on the final list, the agent shall not in that procurement recommence negotiations or enter into a contract for the construction services or professional services covered by the final list with any person or firm on the final list with whom the agent has terminated negotiations.

2. An agent shall issue a request for qualifications for each procurement and publish notice of the request for qualifications. This notice shall be published by advertising in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the agent is located for two consecutive publications if it is a weekly newspaper or for two publications that are at least six but no more than ten days apart if it is a daily newspaper.  The publication shall include the fact that multiple contracts may or will be awarded, shall state the number of contracts that may or will be awarded and shall describe the professional services or job-order-contracting construction services to be performed under each contract. The request for qualifications shall:

(a) State the following information about the contracts that may or will be awarded:

(i) If the request for qualifications is for multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, that multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services may or will be awarded, the number of contracts that may or will be awarded, the services to be performed under each of the multiple contracts and that each of the multiple contracts will be awarded to a separate person or firm.

(ii) If the request for qualifications is for multiple contracts for professional services, that multiple contracts for professional services may or will be awarded, the number of contracts that may or will be awarded, the services to be performed under each of the multiple contracts and either that each of the multiple contracts will be awarded to a separate person or firm or that all of the multiple contracts will be awarded to the same person or firm.

(b) State as to final lists:

(i) In a procurement of multiple contracts for professional services to be awarded to a single person or firm, that there will be a single final list of at least three but no more than five persons or firms.

(ii) In a procurement for multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms or in a procurement for multiple contracts for similar professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, that there will be a single final list and the number of persons or firms on the final list, which shall be the sum of the number of contracts that may or will be awarded and a number that is determined by the agent and that is not more than five.

(iii) In a procurement for multiple contracts for different professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, that there will be a separate final list for each type of professional services and that the number of persons or firms on each final list will be the number of contracts that may or will be awarded for each type of professional services and a number that is determined by the agent and that is not more than five.

(c) As prescribed below, state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used by the selection committee, except that in a procurement for multiple contracts for job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms one of the criteria shall be the person's or firm's subcontractor selection plan or procedures to implement the agent's subcontractor selection plan. All selection criteria pursuant to this subsection shall be factors that demonstrate competence and qualifications for the type of professional services or job-order-contracting construction services included in the procurement.  If:

(i) Interviews will be held, the request for qualifications shall state the selection criteria and the relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms to be interviewed and the request for qualifications may state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms on each final list and in determining their order on each final list.  The final list selection criteria and relative weights may be different than the selection criteria and relative weights used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed. The request for qualifications also shall state whether the agent will select the persons or firms on the final list and their order on the final list solely through the results of the interview process or through the combined results of both the interview process and the evaluation of statements of qualifications and performance data submitted in response to the agent's request for qualifications.

(ii) Interviews will not be held, the request for qualifications shall state the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used in selecting the persons or firms on each final list and in determining their order on each final list.

(d) If the agent will hold interviews as part of the selection process:

(i) In a procurement of multiple contracts for professional services to be awarded to the same person or firm, state that interviews will be held and that the interviews will be with at least three but not more than five persons or firms.

(ii) In a procurement of multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms or in a procurement of multiple contracts for similar professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, state that interviews will be held and that the interviews will be with a specified number of persons or firms.  The specified number shall be stated in the request for qualifications, shall be determined by the agent, and shall be the sum of the number of contracts that may or will be awarded and a number that is determined by the agent and that is not more than five.

(iii) In a procurement of multiple contracts for different professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, state that interviews will be held and that the interviews will be with a specified number of persons or firms. The specified number shall be stated in the request for qualifications, shall be determined by the agent, shall be at least three times the number of contracts that may or will be awarded and shall not be more than five times the number of contracts that may or will be awarded.

(e) For procurements of multiple contracts for job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, include either:

(i) A requirement that each person or firm submit a proposed subcontractor selection plan and a requirement that the proposed subcontractor selection plan must select subcontractors based on qualifications alone or on a combination of qualifications and price and shall not select subcontractors based on price alone.

(ii) A subcontractor selection plan adopted by the agent that applies to the person or firm that is selected to perform the job-order-contracting construction services and that requires subcontractors to be selected based on qualifications alone or on a combination of qualifications and price and not based on price alone and a requirement that each person or firm must submit a description of the procedures it proposes to use to implement the agent's subcontractor selection plan.

(f) Include a description of the publicly available location of the agent's protest policy and procedures or, if the agent does not have a protest policy and procedures, a statement that the protest policy and procedures referred to in subsection J of this section apply to any protests in connection with the procurement.

3. An agent shall initiate an appropriately qualified selection committee for each request for qualifications.  The agent shall ensure that the selection committee members are competent to serve on the selection committee.  Each selection committee must include one employee of the agent or an agent representative who is appointed by the agent.  The same selection committee shall function as to all of the multiple contracts included in the procurement.  If the agent is procuring multiple contracts for professional services, the agent shall determine the number and qualifications of the selection committee members. A selection committee for the procurement of multiple contracts for job-order-contracting construction services shall have not more than seven members, except that if the contract involves the agent and additional governmental or private participants, the number of members of the selection committee shall be increased by one for each additional participant, except that the maximum number of members of the selection committee is nine. The selection committee for multiple contracts for job-order-contracting construction services shall include at least one person who is a senior management employee of a licensed contractor and one person who is an architect or engineer registered pursuant to section 32-121. These members may be employees of the agent or outside consultants. Outside contractors, architects and engineers serving on a selection committee shall not receive compensation from the agent for performing this service, but the agent may elect to reimburse outside contractors, architects and engineers for travel, lodging and other expenses incurred in connection with service on a selection committee.  A person who is a member of a selection committee shall not be a contractor under a contract awarded under the procurement or provide any professional services, construction, construction services, materials or other services under the contract.  The selection committee and the agent shall do the following:

(a) If interviews are specified in the request for qualifications:

(i) The selection committee shall determine the persons or firms to be interviewed by evaluating the statements of qualifications and performance data that are submitted in response to the agent's request for qualifications based only on the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria stated in the request for qualifications to be used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.

(ii) If the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used by the selection committee to select the persons or firms on a final list and to determine their order on a final list are not included in the request for qualifications, before the interviews are held the agent shall distribute to the persons or firms to be interviewed the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria to be used to select the persons or firms on each final list and to determine their order on each final list.  These selection criteria and relative weight may be different than the selection criteria and relative weight used to determine the persons or firms to be interviewed.

(iii) The selection committee shall conduct interviews with the number of persons or firms to be interviewed as stated in the request for qualifications regarding the professional services or job-order-contracting construction services and the relative methods of approach for furnishing the required professional services or job-order-contracting construction services.

(b) Based only on the selection criteria and relative weight of the selection criteria specified as provided in this subsection for selection of the persons or firms on each final list and their order on each final list, the selection committee shall select the persons or firms for each final list and in the case of a final list or final lists for multiple contracts that will be negotiated under subsection E of this section, rank the persons or firms on each final list in order of preference. If the procurement is for multiple contracts for different professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, there is a separate final list for each type of professional services, and if a person or firm submitted qualifications for more than one type of professional services, the person or firm may be on more than one final list.

(c) If the contract will be negotiated under subsection E of this section, before or at the same time as the agent notifies the persons or firms on each final list that they are on that final list, the agent shall send actual notice to the following persons or firms that they are not on that final list:

(i) If interviews were held, the other persons and firms interviewed for that final list.

(ii) If interviews were not held, the other persons and firms that made submittals for that final list.

(d) If the contract will be awarded under subsection F of this section, before or at the same time as the agent notifies the persons or firms on the final list that they are on the final list, the agent shall send actual notice to each of the following persons or firms that they are not on the final list or that other persons or firms are on the final list:

(i) If interviews were held, the other persons or firms interviewed.

(ii) If interviews were not held, the other persons or firms that made submittals.

D. An agent shall award multiple contracts specified in the request for qualifications as provided in subsection E or F of this section.

E. The agent shall conduct negotiations with persons or firms on the final list or final lists.  The negotiations shall include consideration of compensation and other contract terms that the agent determines to be fair and reasonable to the agent.  In making this decision, the agent shall take into account the estimated value, the scope, the complexity and the nature of the professional services or job-order-contracting construction services to be rendered.  If in a procurement under this section the agent terminates negotiations with a person or firm on a final list and commences negotiations with another person or firm on that final list, the agent shall not in that procurement recommence negotiations or enter into a contract for the job-order-contracting construction services or professional services covered by that final list with any person or firm on that final list with whom the agent has terminated negotiations.  If the procurement is for:

1. Multiple contracts for professional services to be awarded to a single person or firm, there is one final list and the agent shall enter into negotiations with the highest qualified person or firm on the final list.  If the agent is not able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the highest qualified person or firm on the final list, at compensation and on other contract terms the agent determines to be fair and reasonable, the agent shall then undertake negotiations with the next most qualified person or firm on the final list in sequence until an agreement is reached or a determination is made to reject all persons or firms on the final list.

2. Multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms or for multiple contracts for similar professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, there is one final list and the agent shall enter into separate negotiations for contracts with the number of the highest qualified persons or firms on the final list equal to the number of contracts to be awarded.  If the agent is not able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with a person or firm with whom the agent has commenced negotiations, the agent shall formally terminate negotiations with that person or firm.  The agent shall then undertake negotiations for a contract with the next most qualified person or firm on the final list with whom the agent is not then negotiating and with whom the agent has not previously negotiated in sequence until an agreement is reached for some or all of the multiple contracts included in the request for qualifications or a determination is made to reject all persons or firms on the final list.

3. Multiple contracts for different professional services to be awarded to separate persons or firms, there is a separate final list for each type of professional services and the agent shall enter into separate negotiations for contracts with the number of the highest qualified persons or firms on the final list equal to the number of contracts to be awarded.  If the agent is not able to negotiate a satisfactory contract with a person or firm with whom the agent has commenced negotiations, the agent shall formally terminate negotiations with that person or firm.  The agent shall then undertake negotiations for a contract with the next most qualified person or firm on the final list with whom the agent is not then negotiating and with whom the agent has not previously negotiated in sequence until an agreement is reached for some or all of the multiple contracts included in the request for qualifications or a determination is made to reject all persons or firms on the final list.

F. As an alternative to subsection E of this section, an agent may award multiple contracts for similar job-order-contracting construction services to be awarded to separate persons or firms as follows:

1. The agent shall use the selection committee appointed for the request for qualifications pursuant to subsection C of this section.

2. The agent shall issue a request for proposals to the persons or firms on the final list developed pursuant to subsection C of this section.

3. The request for proposals shall include:

(e) A statement that in applying the scoring method the selection committee will separately evaluate the technical proposal and the price proposal and will evaluate and score the technical proposal before opening the price proposal.

(f) If the agent conducts discussions pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection, a statement that discussions will be held and a requirement that each offeror submit a preliminary technical proposal before the discussions are held.

4. If the agent determines to conduct discussions pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection, each offeror shall submit a preliminary technical proposal to the agent before those discussions are held.

5. If determined by the agent and included by the agent in the request for proposals, the selection committee shall conduct discussions with all offerors that submit preliminary technical proposals. Discussions shall be for the purpose of clarification to ensure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and for clarification by the owner.  Revision of preliminary technical proposals shall be permitted after submission of preliminary technical proposals and before award for the purpose of obtaining best and final proposals. In conducting any discussions, information derived from proposals submitted by competing offerors shall not be disclosed to other competing offerors.

6. After completion of any discussions pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection or if no discussions are held, each offeror shall submit separately the offeror's final technical proposal and its price proposal.

7. Before opening any price proposal, the selection committee shall open the final technical proposals, evaluate the final technical proposals and score the final technical proposals using the scoring method in the request for proposals.  No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation and scoring.

8. After completion of the evaluation and scoring of all final technical proposals, the selection committee shall open the price proposals, evaluate the price proposals, score the price proposals and complete the scoring of the entire proposals using the scoring method in the request for proposals.  No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation and scoring.

9. The agent shall award the multiple contracts to the responsive and responsible offerors whose proposals receive the highest scores under the method of scoring in the request for proposals.  No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation.  Before or at the same time as the agent notifies the winning offerors that they have won, the agent shall send actual notice to each other offeror either that the offeror has not won or that other offerors have won.

10. The contracts file shall contain the basis on which the award is made, including at a minimum the information and documents required under subsection G of this section.

G. If the procurement has multiple final lists under subsection C of this section or multiple requests for proposals under subsection F of this section, the agent shall retain the items in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, as applicable, for each final list and each request for proposals procurement process.  At a minimum, the agent shall retain the following for each procurement under this section:

1. The contractor performing the construction services is permitted to self-perform part of the construction work if and to the extent agreed in writing by the agent and the contractor.  The agent may use methods other than competitive bidding to assure itself that the price the agent pays to the contractor for self-performed work is fair and reasonable. Permitted methods to evaluate fairness and reasonableness of the price of self-performed work include evaluation of the contractor's proposed scope of work and price for self-performed work by an estimator who is hired and paid by the agent, who is independent of the contractor and who may be an employee of the agent.  Although the agent may elect to so require, nothing in this chapter, this title or any other law shall be construed or interpreted to require the agent to require a contractor desiring to self-perform part of the construction work to competitively bid that part of the construction work against other contractors in a bid competition.

If the agent does not have a procurement protest policy and procedures that have been formally adopted and published by the agent, for protests relating to procurements under this chapter the agent shall follow the procurement protest policy and procedures of the department of administration. The agent shall process all protests relating to procurements under this section. If the agent does have a procurement protest policy and procedures that have been formally adopted and published by the agent, the agent may choose to make information relating to each procurement available earlier than required under section 34-603, subsection H and section 34-604, subsection H if the agent determines the release of the information is necessary to adequately follow and manage its procurement protest policy and procedures.

M. For the purposes of this section, "professional services" includes architect services, engineer services, landscape architect services, assayer services, geologist services and land surveying services and any combination of those services.

#### Section 34-606. Emergency procurements

Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, an agent may make or authorize others to make emergency procurements of architect services, construction-manager-at-risk construction services, design-bid-build construction services, design-build construction services, engineer services, job-order-contracting construction services, landscape architect services, assayer services, geologist services or land surveying services if a threat to the public health, welfare or safety exists or if a situation exists that makes compliance with this title impracticable, unnecessary or contrary to the public interest, except that these emergency procurements shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances.  A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the contract file.

 

#### Section 34-607. Multiterm contracts for job-order-contracting construction services

A. A contract for construction services using the job-order-contracting method may be entered into for a period of up to five years, as deemed to be in the best interest of the agent, if the term of the contract and conditions of renewal or extension, if any, are included in the solicitation and monies are available for the first fiscal period at the time of contracting.  Payment and performance obligations for succeeding fiscal periods are subject to the availability and appropriation of monies.

B. Before the use of a multiterm contract, the agent shall determine in writing that:

1. Estimated requirements cover the period of the contract and are reasonable and continuing.

2. Such a contract will serve the best interests of the agent by encouraging effective competition or otherwise promoting economies in the agent's procurement.

C. If monies are not appropriated or otherwise made available to support the continuation of performance in a subsequent fiscal period, the contract shall be cancelled and the contractor may only be reimbursed for the reasonable value of any nonrecurring costs that are incurred but not amortized in the price of the construction services delivered under the contract or that are otherwise not recoverable.  The cost of cancellation may be paid from any appropriations available for these purposes.

 

#### Section 34-608. Bid security for design-build and job-order-contracting construction services

A. As a guarantee that the contractor will enter into a contract, bid security is required for all design-build construction services and all job-order-contracting construction services awarded by an agent by competitive sealed proposals pursuant to section 34-603, subsection F or 34-604, subsection F if the agent estimates that the budget for construction, excluding the cost of any finance services, maintenance services, operations services, design services, preconstruction services or other related services, will be more than the amount prescribed in section 41-2535, subsection D. Each proposal for design-build construction services or job-order-contracting construction services shall be accompanied by a certified check, cashier's check or surety bond.  The bid security amount for design-build construction services shall be an amount equal to ten percent of the agent's budget for construction, excluding any finance services, maintenance services, operations services, design services, preconstruction services or other related services, for the project as stated in the request for proposals. The bid security amount for job-order-contracting construction services shall be the amount determined by the agent and stated in the request for proposals and shall not be more than ten percent of the agent's reasonably estimated budget for construction that the agent believes is likely to actually be done during the first year of the job-order-contracting contract, excluding any finance services, maintenance services, operations services, design services, preconstruction services or other related services that are included in the contract.

B. The agent shall return the certified check, cashier's check or surety bond to the contractors whose proposals are not accepted and to the successful contractor on the execution of satisfactory payment and performance bonds, insurance and the contract as provided in this chapter.

C. Notwithstanding any other statute, the surety bond shall be executed solely by a surety company or companies holding a certificate of authority to transact surety business in this state issued by the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions pursuant to title 20, chapter 2, article 1.  The bond shall not be executed by an individual surety or sureties, even if the requirements of section 7-101 are satisfied.

D. The conditions and provisions of the surety bond regarding the surety's obligations shall follow the following form:

Now, therefore, if the obligee accepts the proposal of the principal and the principal enters into a contract with the obligee in accordance with the terms of the proposal and gives the bonds and certificates of insurance as specified in the standard specifications with good and sufficient surety for the faithful performance of the contract and for the prompt payment of labor and materials furnished in the prosecution of the contract, or in the event of the failure of the principal to enter into the contract and give the bonds and certificates of insurance, if the principal pays to the obligee the difference not to exceed the penalty of the bond between the amount specified in the proposal and any larger amount for which the obligee may contract in good faith with another party to perform the work covered by the proposal, this obligation is void. Otherwise it remains in full force and effect. Provided, however, that this bond is executed pursuant to section 34-608, Arizona Revised Statutes, and all liabilities on this bond shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the section to the extent as if it were copied at length in this agreement.

E. If the request for proposals requires security, noncompliance requires that the agent reject the proposal for noncompliance with the security requirement, unless the agent determines that the bid fails to comply in a nonsubstantial manner with the security requirements.

F. After the agent opens the proposals, the proposals are irrevocable for the period specified in the request for proposals, except as provided in section 34-603, subsection F or section 34-604, subsection F.  If a proposer is allowed to withdraw its proposal before award, no action may be had against the proposer or the bid security.

G. All bonds given by a contractor and surety pursuant to this section, regardless of their actual form, are deemed by law to be the form required and set forth in this section.

#### Section 34-609. Contracts for construction-manager-at-risk, design-build and job-order-contracting construction services; payments to contractor; security; recovery of damages by contractor for delay; progress payments; changed or additional work; attorney fees; definitions

A. An agent shall enter into a contract with the selected person or firm for construction-manager-at-risk construction services, design-build construction services or job-order-contracting construction services.

B. The terms of a contract entered into pursuant to subsection A shall include the following items:

1. A surety company bond or bonds as required by this chapter.

2. The owner by mutual agreement may make progress payments on contracts of less than ninety days and shall make monthly progress payments on all other contracts as provided for in this paragraph. Payment to the contractor on the basis of a duly certified and approved estimate of the work performed during the preceding calendar month under the contract may include payment for material and equipment, but to ensure the proper performance of the contract, the owner shall retain ten percent of the amount of each estimate until final completion and acceptance of all material, equipment and work covered by the contract.  An estimate of the work submitted shall be deemed approved and certified for payment seven days after the date of submission unless before that time the owner or owner's agent prepares and issues a specific written finding setting forth those items in detail in the estimate of the work that are not approved for payment under the contract.  The owner may withhold an amount from the progress payment sufficient to pay the expenses the owner reasonably expects to incur in correcting the deficiency set forth in the written finding.  The progress payments shall be paid on or before fourteen days after the estimate of the work is certified and approved.  The estimate of the work shall be deemed received by the owner on submission to any person designated by the owner for the submission, review or approval of the estimate of the work.

3. When the contract is fifty percent completed, one-half of the amount retained including any securities substituted under paragraph 5 of this subsection shall be paid to the contractor on the contractor's request provided the contractor is making satisfactory progress on the contract and there is no specific cause or claim requiring a greater amount to be retained.  After the contract is fifty percent completed, not more than five percent of the amount of any subsequent progress payments made under the contract may be retained providing the contractor is making satisfactory progress on the project, except that if at any time the owner determines satisfactory progress is not being made, ten percent retention shall be reinstated for all progress payments made under the contract after the determination.

4. On completion and acceptance of each separate building, public work or other division of the contract on which the price is stated separately in the contract, except as qualified in paragraph 5 of this subsection, payment may be made in full, including retained percentages, less authorized deductions. In preparing estimates, the material and equipment delivered on the site to be incorporated in the job shall be taken into consideration in determining the estimated value by the architect, engineer or other person, as specified in the contract.

5. Ten percent of all estimates shall be retained by the agent as a guarantee for complete performance of the contract, to be paid to the contractor within sixty days after completion or filing notice of completion of the contract. Retention of payments by an agent longer than sixty days after final completion and acceptance requires a specific written finding by the agent of the reasons justifying the delay in payment. An agent may not retain any monies after sixty days that are in excess of the amount necessary to pay the expenses the agent reasonably expects to incur in order to pay or discharge the expenses determined by the agent in the finding justifying the retention of monies. In lieu of the retention provided in this section, the agent, at the option of the contractor, shall accept as a substitute an assignment of time certificates of deposit of banks licensed by this state, securities of or guaranteed by the United States of America, securities of this state, securities of counties, municipalities and school districts within this state or shares of savings and loan associations authorized to transact business in this state, in an amount equal to ten percent of all estimates that are retained by the agent as a guarantee for complete performance of the contract.  If the agent accepts substitute security as described in this paragraph for the ten percent retention, the contractor is entitled to receive all interest or income earned by this security as it accrues and all such security in lieu of retention shall be returned to the contractor by the agent within sixty days after final completion and acceptance of all material, equipment and work covered by the contract if the contractor has furnished the agent satisfactory receipts for all labor and material billed and waivers of liens from any and all persons holding claims against the work. The agent may not accept a time certificate of deposit of a bank or shares of a savings and loan association in lieu of the retention specified unless accompanied by a signed and acknowledged waiver of the bank or savings and loan association of any right or power to setoff against either the agent or the contractor in relationship to the certificates or shares assigned.

6. If the agent has accepted substitute security as provided in paragraph 5 of this subsection, any subcontractor undertaking to perform any part of this public work is entitled to provide substitute security to the contractor on terms and conditions similar to those described in paragraph 5 of this subsection, and this security is in lieu of any retention under the subcontract.

7. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 through 6 of this subsection, any other provision of this section and any other law, there is no retention for job-order-contracting construction services contracts and the agent may elect to have no retention for construction-manager-at-risk and design-build construction services contracts.

C. A contract for construction services may not materially alter the rights of any contractor, subcontractor or material supplier to receive prompt and timely payment required to be included in the contract under subsection B of this section.

D. The contract shall be signed by the agent and the contractor.

E. A contract for the procurement of construction services shall include a provision that provides for negotiations between the agent and the contractor for the recovery of damages related to expenses incurred by the contractor for a delay for which the agent is responsible, that is unreasonable under the circumstances and that was not within the contemplation of the parties to the contract. This section does not void any provision in the contract that requires notice of delays, provides for arbitration or other procedures for settlement or provides for liquidated damages.

F. The contractor shall pay to the contractor's subcontractors or material suppliers and each subcontractor shall pay to the subcontractor's subcontractor or material supplier, within seven days after receipt of each progress payment, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, the respective amounts allowed the contractor or subcontractor on account of the work performed by the subcontractors, to the extent of each subcontractor's interest, except that a contract for construction services may not materially alter the rights of any contractor, subcontractor or material supplier to receive prompt and timely payment as provided under this section.  The payments to subcontractors or material suppliers shall be based on payments received pursuant to this section.  Any diversion by the contractor or subcontractor of payments received for work performed on a contract, or failure to reasonably account for the application or use of those payments, constitutes grounds for disciplinary action by the registrar of contractors. The subcontractor or material supplier shall notify the registrar of contractors and the agent in writing of any payment less than the amount or percentage approved for the class or item of work as set forth in this section.

G. A subcontractor may notify the agent in writing requesting that the subcontractor be notified by the agent in writing within five days after payment of each progress payment that is made to the contractor. The subcontractor's request remains in effect for the duration of the subcontractor's work on the project.

H. This chapter does not prevent the contractor or subcontractor, at the time of application and certification to the owner or contractor, from withholding the application and certification to the owner or contractor for payment to the subcontractor or material supplier for unsatisfactory job progress, defective construction work or materials not remedied, disputed work or materials, third-party claims filed or reasonable evidence that a claim will be filed, failure of a subcontractor to make timely payments for labor, equipment and materials, damage to the contractor or another subcontractor, reasonable evidence that the subcontract cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract sum or a reasonable amount for retention that does not exceed the actual percentage retained by the owner.

I. If any payment to a contractor is delayed after the date due interest shall be paid at the rate of one percent per month or fraction of a month on the unpaid balance as may be due.

J. If any periodic or final payment to a subcontractor is delayed by more than seven days after receipt of the periodic or final payment by the contractor or subcontractor, the contractor or subcontractor shall pay the subcontractor or material supplier interest, beginning on the eighth day, at the rate of one percent per month or fraction of a month on the unpaid balance as may be due.

K. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, this section applies only to amounts payable in a construction services contract for construction and does not apply to amounts payable in a construction services contract for design services, preconstruction services, finance services, maintenance services, operations services and other related services.

L. If the owner directs the contractor in writing to perform changed or additional work in accordance with the construction contract and the contractor submits to the owner a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract, pending a final determination of the total amount to be paid for the changed or additional work, the contractor may request payment for changed or additional work that the contractor completed during the preceding calendar month in monthly pay estimates based on the costs the contractor incurred to perform that work.  The person designated in the construction contract to certify and approve the monthly payment estimate shall make an interim determination for purposes of approval for payment of those costs and certify for payment the amount that person determines to be reasonably justified. Either party may disagree with the interim determination and may assert a claim in accordance with the terms of the construction contract.

M. If the owner directs the contractor in writing to perform changed or additional work in accordance with the construction contract and the contractor submits to the owner a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract and if the contractor directs the subcontractor to perform the changed or additional work in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the contractor and subcontractor and the subcontractor submits to the contractor a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract, pending a final determination of the total amount to be paid for the changed or additional work, the subcontractor may request payment from the contractor for the changed or additional work that the subcontractor completed during the preceding calendar month in monthly pay estimates based on the costs the subcontractor incurred to perform that work. Either party may disagree with the interim determination and may assert a claim in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the contractor and subcontractor.

N. In any action or arbitration brought pursuant to this section, the successful party shall be awarded reasonable attorney fees and costs.

O. For the purposes of this section:

1. Contractor does not include an agricultural improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 17, an electric cooperative formed pursuant to title 10, chapter 19, article 2 or 4 or a domestic water improvement district or a domestic wastewater improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 6, article 4.

2. "Costs" means the aggregate cost of all labor, materials, equipment and services.

3. Subcontractor does not include an agricultural improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 17, an electric cooperative formed pursuant to title 10, chapter 19, article 2 or 4 or a domestic water improvement district or a domestic wastewater improvement district formed pursuant to title 48, chapter 6, article 4.

4. "Work" means the labor, materials, equipment and services to be provided by a contractor or subcontractor under a construction contract.

#### Section 34-610. Construction-manager-at-risk, design-build and job-order-contracting construction services surety bond required; suit on bond; limitations

A. Except if specifically exempted by statute, before an agent executes any contract with any person or firm for construction-manager-at-risk construction services, design-build construction services or job-order-contracting construction services, the person or firm shall furnish to the agent entering into the contract the following bonds, except that the bonds shall be furnished only on and at the same time as execution of a contract or an amendment to a contract that commits the contractor to provide construction for a fixed price, a guaranteed maximum price or any other fixed amount within a designated time frame:

1. A performance bond in an amount equal to the full contract amount conditioned on the faithful performance of the contract in accordance with plans, specifications and conditions of the contract, except that:

(a) For job-order-contracting construction services, the performance bond shall cover the full amount of construction under the job-order-contracting construction services contract, shall not include any design services, preconstruction services, finance services, maintenance services, operations services or other related services included in the contract, may be a single bond for the full term of the contract, a separate bond for each year of a multiyear contract or a separate bond for each job order, as determined by the agent, and, if a single bond for the full term of the contract or a separate bond for each year of a multiyear contract, shall initially be based on the agent's reasonable estimate of the amount of construction that the agent believes is likely to actually be done during the full term of the contract or during the particular year of a multiyear contract, as applicable.

(b) For construction-manager-at-risk construction services and design-build construction services, the amount of the performance bond shall be the price of construction and shall not include the cost of any design services, preconstruction services, finance services, maintenance services, operations services or any other related services included in the contract.  The performance bond shall be solely for the protection of the public body awarding the contract.

2. A payment bond in an amount equal to the full contract amount solely for the protection of claimants supplying labor or materials to the contractor or the contractor's subcontractors in the prosecution of the construction and not for the protection of persons providing any design services, preconstruction services, finance services, maintenance services, operations services or other related services provided for in the contract, except that:

(a) For job-order-contracting construction services, the payment bond shall cover the full amount of construction under the job-order-contracting construction services contract, shall not include any design services, preconstruction services, finance services, maintenance services, operations services or other related services included in the contract, may be a single bond for the full term of the contract, a separate bond for each year of a multiyear contract or a separate bond for each job order, as determined by the agent, and, if a single bond for the full term of the contract or a separate bond for each year of a multiyear contract, shall initially be based on the agent's reasonable estimate of the amount of construction that the agent believes is likely to actually be done during the full term of the contract or during the particular year of a multiyear contract, as applicable.

(b) For construction-manager-at-risk construction services and design-build construction services, the amount of the payment bond shall be the price of construction and shall not include the cost of any design services, preconstruction services, finance services, maintenance services, operations services or any other related services included in the contract.

B. Each bond shall include a provision allowing the prevailing party in a suit on the bond to recover as a part of the judgment any reasonable attorney fees as may be fixed by the court.

C. Notwithstanding any other statute, each bond shall be executed solely by a surety company or companies holding a certificate of authority to transact surety business in this state issued by the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions pursuant to title 20, chapter 2, article 1.  The bonds shall not be executed by an individual surety or sureties, even if the requirements of section 7-101 are satisfied. The bonds shall be payable to the public body concerned.

D. The bonds shall be filed in the office of the department, board, commission, institution, agency or other contracting body awarding the contract.

E. It is illegal for a request for qualifications or a request for proposals pursuant to section 34-603 or 34-604, or any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of the contracting body, to require that bonds be furnished by a particular surety company, or through a particular agent or broker.

F. The conditions and provisions in the payment bond regarding the surety's obligations shall follow the following form:

Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is that if the principal promptly pays all monies due to all persons supplying labor or materials to the principal or the principal's subcontractors in the prosecution of the construction provided for in the contract, this obligation is void. Otherwise it remains in full force and effect.  Provided, however, that this bond is executed pursuant to title 34, chapter 6, Arizona Revised Statutes, and all liabilities on this bond shall be determined in accordance with the provisions, conditions and limitations of title 34, chapter 6, Arizona Revised Statutes, to the same extent as if they were copied at length in this agreement. The prevailing party in a suit on this bond shall recover as a part of the judgment reasonable attorney fees that may be fixed by the court.

G. The conditions and provisions in the performance bond regarding the surety's obligations shall follow the following form:

Now, therefore, the condition of this obligation is that if the principal faithfully performs and fulfills all of the undertakings, covenants, terms, conditions and agreements of the contract during the original term of the contract and any extension of the contract, with or without notice to the surety, and during the life of any guaranty required under the contract, and also performs and fulfills all of the undertakings, covenants, terms, conditions and agreements of all duly authorized modifications of the contract that may hereafter be made, notice of which modifications to the surety being hereby waived, the above obligation is void.  Otherwise it remains in full force and effect. Provided, however, that this bond is executed pursuant to title 34, chapter 6, Arizona Revised Statutes, and all liabilities on this bond shall be determined in accordance with title 34, chapter 6, Arizona Revised Statutes, to the extent as if it were copied at length in this agreement. The prevailing party in a suit on this bond shall recover as part of the judgment reasonable attorney fees that may be fixed by the court. The performance under this bond is limited to the construction to be performed under the contract and does not include any design services, preconstruction services, finance services, maintenance services, operations services or any other related services included in the contract.

H. If the prime contract or specifications require any persons supplying labor or materials in the prosecution of the work to furnish payment or performance bonds, these bonds shall be executed solely by a surety company or companies holding a certificate of authority to transact surety business in this state issued by the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions pursuant to title 20, chapter 2, article 1.  Notwithstanding any other statute, the bonds shall not be executed by an individual surety or sureties, even if the requirements of section 7-101 are satisfied.

I. All bonds given by a contractor and surety pursuant to this section, regardless of their actual form, are deemed by law to be in the form required and set forth in this section.

#### Section 34-611. Payment bonds for construction-manager-at-risk, design-build and job-order-contracting construction services

The notice shall be served by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to the contractor at any place the contractor maintains an office or conducts business, or at the contractor's residence.

B. Every suit instituted under this section shall be brought in the name of the claimant, but no suit may be commenced after the expiration of one year from the date on which the last of the labor was performed or materials were supplied by the person bringing this suit.

C. The contracting body and the agent in charge of its office shall furnish to anyone making written application therefor and who states that it has supplied labor or materials for work, and payment therefor has not been made, or that it is being sued on any bond, or that it is the surety on the bond, a certified copy of the bond and the contract for which it was given, which copy is prima facie evidence of the contents, execution and delivery of the original. Applicants shall pay for these certified copies such reasonable fees as the contracting body or the agent in charge of its office fixes to cover the actual cost of preparation of the copies.
