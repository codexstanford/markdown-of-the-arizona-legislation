You or your spouse may file a certified copy of this order with your local law enforcement agency. A certified copy may be obtained from the clerk of the court that issued this order. If you are the person that brought this action, you must also file evidence with the law enforcement agency that this order was served on your spouse.

This court order is effective until a final decree of dissolution, legal separation or annulment is filed or the action is dismissed.

B. The preliminary injunction is effective against the petitioner when the petition is filed and against the respondent on service of a copy of the order or on actual notice of the order, whichever is sooner.

The court shall provide for an order for equal possession of the liquid assets of the marital property that existed as of the date the petition for dissolution or legal separation or annulment was served, unless the court finds that there is good cause not to divide those assets. The court's division of liquid assets held by financial institutions does not invalidate applicable law or any provision of an account agreement that assesses penalties against the account holder for premature or unscheduled withdrawals of account funds. The motion shall be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the factual basis for the motion and the amounts requested and, if appropriate, the liquid assets of the parties. An order for equal possession of the liquid assets of the marital property does not prejudice any final division of the marital community. This subsection does not eliminate the application of the preliminary injunction.

F. A person who disobeys or resists an injunction issued pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1, subdivision (b) of this section is subject to arrest and prosecution for interference with judicial proceedings pursuant to section 13-2810 and the following procedures apply:

1. Any party may cause a certified copy of the injunction and return of service on the other party to be registered with the sheriff having jurisdiction of the area in which the party resides. The party originally registering the injunction shall register any changes or modifications of the injunction with the sheriff. For enforcement by arrest and prosecution for interference with judicial proceedings, a certified copy of the injunction, whether or not registered with the sheriff, is presumed to be a valid existing order of the court until a final decree of dissolution, legal separation or annulment is entered or the action for dissolution or legal separation is dismissed.

2. A peace officer, with or without a warrant, may arrest a person if the peace officer has probable cause to believe that an offense under this subsection has been committed and has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed the offense, whether the offense is a felony or a misdemeanor and whether such offense was committed within or without the presence of the peace officer. The release procedures available under section 13-3883, subsection A, paragraph 4 and section 13-3903 do not apply to arrests made pursuant to this subsection.

3. A peace officer making an arrest pursuant to this subsection is not civilly or criminally liable for the arrest if the officer acts on probable cause and without malice.

4. A person who is arrested pursuant to this subsection may be released from custody in accordance with the rules of criminal procedure or other applicable statute. An order for release, with or without an appearance bond, shall include pretrial release conditions necessary to provide for the protection of the alleged victim and other specifically designated persons and may provide additional conditions that the court deems appropriate, including participation in any counseling programs available to the defendant.

#### Section 25-316. Temporary orders; definition

A. In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, legal separation or annulment or for maintenance or support following a dissolution of marriage by a court that lacked personal jurisdiction over an absent spouse, either party may move for temporary orders seeking any of the following:

1. An order for equal possession of the liquid assets of the marital property.

2. Temporary spousal maintenance.

3. Temporary legal decision-making and parenting time of a child common to the parties.

4. Temporary support of a child, natural or adopted, common to the parties entitled to support.

5. Exclusive use and possession of the family home or the home of the moving party.

6. Exclusive use and possession of other property of the parties.

7. An interim award of attorney fees and costs.

8. Other relief deemed necessary pending final resolution of the issues of the parties.

B. A party who seeks an order for equal possession of liquid assets shall file a motion that is accompanied by an affidavit setting forth the factual basis for the motion, the amounts requested and, if appropriate, the liquid assets of the parties. If granted, the court shall provide an order for equal possession of the liquid assets of the marital property that existed as of the date the petition for dissolution, legal separation or annulment was served, unless the court finds that there is good cause not to divide those assets. The court's division of liquid assets held by financial institutions does not invalidate applicable law or any provision of an account agreement that assesses penalties against the account holder for premature or unscheduled withdrawals of account monies. An order for equal possession of the liquid assets of the marital property does not prejudice any final division of the marital community. This subsection does not eliminate the application of the preliminary injunction.

C. The court may issue a temporary order without requiring notice to the other party only if it finds, on the basis of the moving affidavit or other evidence, that irreparable injury will result to the moving party or a minor child of the parties if an order is not issued until the time for responding has elapsed. A bond is not required unless the court deems it appropriate.

D. A temporary order:

1. Does not prejudice the rights of the parties or of any child that are to be adjudicated at subsequent hearings in the proceedings.

2. May be revoked or modified before the final decree.

3. That provided for equal possession of the liquid assets of the marital property does not prejudice either party's claim for temporary maintenance, child support or attorney fees.

4. Terminates when the final decree is entered or when the petition for dissolution, legal separation or annulment is dismissed.

E. For the purposes of this section, "liquid assets" includes:

1. Cash.

2. Traveler's checks.

3. Nonretirement funds in financial institutions.

4. Lottery winnings.

5. Cryptocurrency.

6. Coins and precious metals.

#### Section 25-317. Separation agreement; effect

A. To promote amicable settlement of disputes between parties to a marriage attendant on their separation or annulment or the dissolution of their marriage, the parties may enter into a written separation agreement containing provisions for disposition of any property owned by either of them, maintenance of either of them, and support, legal decision-making and parenting time of their children. A separation agreement may provide that its maintenance terms shall not be modified.

B. In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, for annulment or for legal separation, the terms of the separation agreement, except those providing for the support, legal decision-making and parenting time of children, are binding on the court unless it finds, after considering the economic circumstances of the parties and any other relevant evidence produced by the parties, on their own motion or on request of the court, that the separation agreement is unfair.

C. If the court finds the separation agreement unfair as to disposition of property or maintenance, it may request the parties to submit a revised separation agreement or may make orders for the disposition of property or maintenance.

D. If the court finds that the separation agreement is not unfair as to disposition of property or maintenance and that it is reasonable as to support, legal decision-making and parenting time of children, the separation agreement shall be set forth or incorporated by reference in the decree of dissolution, annulment or legal separation and the parties shall be ordered to perform them. If the separation agreement provides that its terms shall not be set forth in the decree, the decree shall identify the separation agreement as incorporated by reference and state that the court has found the terms as to property disposition and maintenance not unfair and the terms as to support, legal decision-making and parenting time of children reasonable.

E. Terms of the agreement set forth or incorporated by reference in the decree are enforceable by all remedies available for enforcement of a judgment, including contempt.

F. Except for terms concerning the maintenance of either party and the support, legal decision-making or parenting time of children, entry of the decree shall thereafter preclude the modification of the terms of the decree and the property settlement agreement, if any, set forth or incorporated by reference.

G. Notwithstanding subsection F of this section, entry of a decree that sets forth or incorporates by reference a separation agreement that provides that its maintenance terms shall not be modified prevents the court from exercising jurisdiction to modify the decree and the separation agreement regarding maintenance, including a decree entered before July 20, 1996.

#### Section 25-318. Disposition of property; retroactivity; notice to creditors; assignment of debts; contempt of court

A. In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, for annulment or for legal separation, or in a proceeding for disposition of property following dissolution of the marriage by a court that previously lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse or previously lacked jurisdiction to dispose of the property, the court shall assign each spouse's sole and separate property to such spouse. Except as provided in section 25-318.02, the court shall also divide the community, joint tenancy and other property held in common equitably, though not necessarily in kind, without regard to marital misconduct. For the purposes of this section only, property acquired by either spouse outside this state shall be deemed to be community property if the property would have been community property if acquired in this state.

B. In dividing property, the court may consider all debts and obligations that are related to the property, including accrued or accruing taxes that would become due on the receipt, sale or other disposition of the property. The court may also consider the exempt status of particular property pursuant to title 33, chapter 8.

C. This section does not prevent the court from considering all actual damages and judgments from conduct that resulted in criminal conviction of either spouse in which the other spouse or a child was the victim or excessive or abnormal expenditures, destruction, concealment or fraudulent disposition of community, joint tenancy and other property held in common.

D. The community, joint tenancy and other property held in common for which no provision is made in the decree shall be from the date of the decree held by the parties as tenants in common, each possessed of an undivided one-half interest.

E. The court may impress a lien on the separate property of either party or the marital property awarded to either party in order to secure the payment of:

1. Any interest or equity the other party has in or to the property.

2. Community debts that the court has ordered to be paid by the parties.

3. An allowance for child support or spousal maintenance, or both.

4. All actual damages and judgments from conduct that resulted in criminal conviction of either spouse in which the other spouse or a child was the victim.

F. The decree or judgment shall specifically describe by legal description any real property affected and shall specifically describe any other property affected.

G. This section applies through both prospective and retrospective operation to property without regard to the date of acquisition.

H. In all actions for dissolution of marriage, annulment or legal separation, the court shall require the following statement in the materials provided to the petitioner and to be served on the respondent:

Notice

In your property settlement agreement or decree of dissolution, annulment or legal separation, the court may assign responsibility for certain community debts to one spouse or the other. Please be aware that a court order that does this is binding on the spouses only and does not necessarily relieve either of you from your responsibility for these community debts. These debts are matters of contract between both of you and your creditors (such as banks, credit unions, credit card issuers, finance companies, utility companies, medical providers and retailers).

Since your creditors are not parties to this court case, they are not bound by court orders or any agreements you and your spouse reach in this case. On request, the court may impose a lien against the separate property of a spouse to secure payment of debts that the court orders that spouse to pay.

You may want to contact your creditors to discuss your debts as well as the possible effects of your court case on your debts. To assist you in identifying your creditors, you may obtain a copy of your spouse's credit report by making a written request to the court for an order requiring a credit reporting agency to release the report to you. Within thirty days after receipt of a request from a spouse who is party to a dissolution of marriage or legal separation action, which includes the court and case number of the action, creditors are required by law to provide information as to the balance and account status of any debts for which the requesting spouse may be liable to the creditor. You may wish to use the following form, or one that is similar, to contact your creditors:

I. On the written request of any party to a pending dissolution of marriage, annulment or legal separation action, the court, except for good cause shown, shall issue an order requiring any credit reporting agency to release the credit report as to the spouse of the requesting party on payment by the requesting party of any customary fee for providing the credit report.

J. On the request of either party and except for good cause shown, the court shall require the parties to submit a debt distribution plan that states the following:

1. How community creditors will be paid.

2. Whether any agreements have been entered into between the parties as to responsibility for the payment of community debts, including what, if any, collateral will secure the payment of the debt.

3. Whether the parties have entered into agreements with creditors through which a community debt will be the sole responsibility of one party.

K. The following form may be used to verify agreements with creditors:

L. If the parties are not able to agree to a joint debt distribution plan pursuant to subsection J of this section, the court may order each party to submit a proposed debt distribution plan to the court.  In its orders relating to the division of property, the court shall reflect the debt distribution plan approved by the court and shall confirm that any community debts that are made the sole responsibility of one of the parties by agreement with a creditor are the sole responsibility of that party.

M. An agreement with a creditor pursuant to subsection K of this section that assigns or otherwise modifies repayment responsibility for community debts secured by real property located in this state shall include all of the following:

1. A legal description of the real property.

2. A copy of the note and recorded security instrument, the repayment of which is to be assigned or modified by the agreement with a creditor.

3. A written and notarized acknowledgment that is executed by all parties to the debt, including the lender, and that states one of the following:

N. An agreement executed pursuant to subsection M of this section shall be recorded by either party in the county in which the real property is located.

P. If a party fails to comply with an order to pay debts, the court may enter orders transferring property of that spouse to compensate the other party. If the court finds that a party is in contempt as to an order to pay community debts, the court may impose appropriate sanctions under the law. A party must bring an action to enforce an order to pay a debt pursuant to this subsection within two years after the date in which the debt should have been paid in full.

Q. Within thirty days after receipt of a written request for information from a spouse who is a party to a dissolution of marriage or legal separation action, which includes the court and case number of the action, a creditor shall provide the balance and account status of any debts of either or both spouses identified by account number for which the requesting spouse may be liable to the creditor.

R. If any part of the court's division of joint, common or community property is in the nature of child support or spousal maintenance, the court shall make specific findings of fact and supporting conclusions of law in its decree.

#### Section 25-318.01. Military retirement benefits; disability related waiver

In making a disposition of property pursuant to section 25-318 or 25-327, a court shall not do any of the following:

1. Consider any federal disability benefits awarded to a veteran for service-connected disabilities pursuant to 10 United States Code section 1413a or 38 United States Code chapter 11.

2. Indemnify the veteran's spouse or former spouse for any prejudgment or postjudgment waiver or reduction in military retired or retainer pay related to receipt of the disability benefits.

3. Award any other income or property of the veteran to the veteran's spouse or former spouse for any prejudgment or postjudgment waiver or reduction in military retired or retainer pay related to receipt of the disability benefits.

 

#### Section 25-318.02. Convicted spouse; award of community property; definition

B. If one spouse is required to make ongoing installment payments to a convicted spouse pursuant to a division of property as described in section 25-318, the spouse making the installment payments may petition the court to modify or cancel that ongoing payment.

C. For the purposes of this section, "convicted spouse" means a person who is convicted of an offense and who is sentenced to at least eighty years in prison or to life in prison, with or without the possibility of parole.

#### Section 25-318.03. Human embryos; disposition; responsibility for resulting child; definitions

A. If an action described in section 25-318, subsection A involves the disposition of in vitro human embryos, the court shall:

1. Award the in vitro human embryos to the spouse who intends to allow the in vitro human embryos to develop to birth.

2. If both spouses intend to allow the in vitro human embryos to develop to birth and both spouses provided their gametes for the in vitro human embryos, resolve any dispute on disposition of the in vitro human embryos in a manner that provides the best chance for the in vitro human embryos to develop to birth.

3. If both spouses intend to allow the in vitro human embryos to develop to birth but only one spouse provided gametes for the in vitro human embryos, award the in vitro human embryos to the spouse that provided gametes for the in vitro human embryos.

B. If an agreement between the spouses concerning the disposition of the in vitro human embryos is brought before the court in an action described in section 25-318, subsection A, the court shall award the in vitro human embryos as prescribed in subsection A of this section.

C. The spouse that is not awarded the in vitro human embryos has no parental responsibilities and no right, obligation or interest with respect to any child resulting from the disputed in vitro human embryos, unless the spouse provided gametes for the in vitro human embryos and consents in writing to be a parent to any resulting child as part of the proceedings concerning the disposition of the in vitro human embryos.

D. If the spouse who is not awarded the in vitro human embryos does not consent to being a parent as provided in subsection C of this section, any resulting child from the disputed in vitro human embryos is not a child of the spouse and has no right, obligation or interest with respect to the spouse.

E. A spouse who provided gametes for the in vitro human embryos and who does not consent to being a parent as provided in subsection C of this section shall provide the spouse awarded the in vitro human embryos as provided in subsection A of this section with detailed written nonidentifying information that includes the health and genetic history of the spouse and the spouse's family in a document that is separate from a document containing identifying information.

#### Section 25-319. Maintenance; guidelines; computation factors

A. In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, or a proceeding for maintenance following dissolution of the marriage by a court that lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse, the court may grant a maintenance order for either spouse for any of the following reasons if it finds that the spouse seeking maintenance:

1. Lacks sufficient property, including property apportioned to the spouse, to provide for that spouse's reasonable needs.

2. Lacks earning ability in the labor market that is adequate to be self-sufficient.

3. Is the parent of a child whose age or condition is such that the parent should not be required to seek employment outside the home.

5. Had a marriage of long duration and is of an age that may preclude the possibility of gaining employment adequate to be self-sufficient.

B. The supreme court shall establish guidelines for determining and awarding spousal maintenance. The court may award spousal maintenance pursuant to the guidelines only for a period of time and in an amount necessary to enable the receiving spouse to become self-sufficient. The amount of spousal maintenance resulting from the application of the guidelines shall be the amount of spousal maintenance ordered by the court, unless the court finds in writing that applying the guidelines would be inappropriate or unjust. The supreme court shall base the guidelines and criteria for deviation from the guidelines on the following relevant factors listed in paragraphs 1 through 13 of this subsection and considered together and weighed in conjunction with each other:

1. The standard of living established during the marriage.

2. The duration of the marriage.

3. The age, employment history, earning ability and physical and emotional condition of the spouse seeking maintenance.

4. The ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is sought to meet that spouse's needs while meeting those of the spouse seeking maintenance.

5. The comparative financial resources of the spouses, including their comparative earning abilities in the labor market.

6. The contribution of the spouse seeking maintenance to the earning ability of the other spouse.

9. The financial resources of the party seeking maintenance, including marital property apportioned to that spouse, and that spouse's ability to meet that spouse's own needs independently.

10. The time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking maintenance to find appropriate employment and whether such education or training is readily available.

11. Excessive or abnormal expenditures, destruction, concealment or fraudulent disposition of community, joint tenancy and other property held in common.

12. The cost for the spouse who is seeking maintenance to obtain health insurance and the reduction in the cost of health insurance for the spouse from whom maintenance is sought if the spouse from whom maintenance is sought is able to convert family health insurance to employee health insurance after the marriage is dissolved.

13. All actual damages and judgments from conduct that resulted in criminal conviction of either spouse in which the other spouse or a child was the victim.

C. A maintenance order shall be made without regard to marital misconduct.

D. If both parties agree, the maintenance order and a decree of dissolution of marriage or of legal separation may state that its maintenance terms shall not be modified.

E. Except as provided in subsection D of this section or section 25-317, subsection G, the court shall maintain continuing jurisdiction over the issue of maintenance for the period of time maintenance is awarded.

#### Section 25-320. Child support; factors; methods of payment; additional enforcement provisions; definitions

A. In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage, legal separation, maintenance or child support, the court may order either or both parents owing a duty of support to a child, born to or adopted by the parents, to pay an amount reasonable and necessary for support of the child, without regard to marital misconduct.

B. If child support has not been ordered by a child support order and if the court deems child support appropriate, the court shall direct, using a retroactive application of the child support guidelines to the date of filing a dissolution of marriage, legal separation, maintenance or child support proceeding, the amount that the parents shall pay for the past support of the child and the manner in which payment shall be paid, taking into account any amount of temporary or voluntary support that has been paid. Retroactive child support is enforceable in any manner provided by law.

C. If the parties lived apart before the date of the filing for dissolution of marriage, legal separation, maintenance or child support and if child support has not been ordered by a child support order, the court may order child support retroactively to the date of separation, but not more than three years before the date of the filing for dissolution of marriage, legal separation, maintenance or child support. The court must first consider all relevant circumstances, including the conduct or motivation of the parties in that filing and the diligence with which service of process was attempted on the obligor spouse or was frustrated by the obligor spouse. If the court determines that child support is appropriate, the court shall direct, using a retroactive application of the child support guidelines, the amount that the parents must pay for the past support of the child and the manner in which payments must be paid, taking into account any amount of temporary or voluntary support that has been paid.

D. The supreme court shall establish guidelines for determining the amount of child support.  The amount resulting from the application of these guidelines is the amount of child support ordered unless a written finding is made, based on criteria approved by the supreme court, that application of the guidelines would be inappropriate or unjust in a particular case.  The supreme court shall review the guidelines at least once every four years to ensure that their application results in the determination of appropriate child support amounts. The supreme court shall base the guidelines and criteria for deviation from them on all relevant factors, considered together and weighed in conjunction with each other, including:

1. The financial resources and needs of the child.

2. The financial resources and needs of the custodial parent.

3. The standard of living the child would have enjoyed if the child lived in an intact home with both parents to the extent it is economically feasible considering the resources of each parent and each parent's need to maintain a home and to provide support for the child when the child is with that parent.

4. The physical and emotional condition of the child, and the child's educational needs.

5. The financial resources and needs of the noncustodial parent.

6. The medical support plan for the child.  The plan should include the child's medical support needs, the availability of medical insurance or services provided by the Arizona health care cost containment system and whether a cash medical support order is necessary.

7. Excessive or abnormal expenditures, destruction, concealment or fraudulent disposition of community, joint tenancy and other property held in common.

8. The duration of parenting time and related expenses.

E. Even if a child is over the age of majority when a petition is filed or at the time of the final decree, the court may order support to continue past the age of majority if all of the following are true:

1. The court has considered the factors prescribed in subsection D of this section.

2. The child has severe mental or physical disabilities as demonstrated by the fact that the child is unable to live independently and be self-supporting.

3. The child's disability began before the child reached the age of majority.

F. If a child reaches the age of majority while the child is attending high school or a certified high school equivalency program, support shall continue to be provided during the period in which the child is actually attending high school or the equivalency program but only until the child reaches nineteen years of age unless the court enters an order pursuant to subsection E of this section.  Notwithstanding any other law, a parent paying support for a child over the age of majority pursuant to this section is entitled to obtain all records related to the attendance of the child in the high school or equivalency program.

G. If a personal check for support payments and handling fees is rightfully dishonored by the payor bank or other drawee, the person obligated to pay support shall make any subsequent support payments and handling fees only by cash, money order, cashier's check, traveler's check or certified check.  If a person required to pay support other than by personal check demonstrates full and timely payment for twenty-four consecutive months, that person may pay support by personal check if these payments are for the full amount, are timely tendered and are not rightfully dishonored by the payor bank or other drawee.

H. Subsection G of this section does not apply to payments made by means of an assignment.

I. If after reasonable efforts to locate the obligee the clerk or support payment clearinghouse is unable to deliver payments for the period prescribed in section 25-503 due to the failure of the person to whom the support has been ordered to be paid to notify the clerk or support payment clearinghouse of a change in address, the clerk or support payment clearinghouse shall not deliver further payments and shall return the payments to the obligor consistent with the requirements of section 25-503.

J. An order for child support shall assign responsibility for providing medical insurance for the child who is the subject of the support order to one of the parents and shall assign responsibility for the payment of any medical costs of the child that are not covered by insurance according to the child support guidelines.  Each parent shall provide information to the court regarding the availability of medical insurance for the child that is accessible and available at a reasonable cost.  In title IV-D cases, the parent responsible pursuant to court order for providing medical insurance for the child shall notify the child support enforcement agency in the department of economic security if medical insurance has been obtained or if the child is no longer covered under an insurance plan.

K. If the court finds that neither parent has the ability to obtain medical insurance for the child that is accessible and available at a reasonable cost, the court shall:

1. In a title IV-D case, in accordance with established title IV-D criteria, establish a reasonable monthly cash medical support order to be paid by the obligor.  If medical assistance is being provided to a child under title XIX of the social security act, cash medical support is assigned to the state pursuant to section 46-407.  On verification that the obligor has obtained private insurance, the cash medical support order terminates by operation of law on the first day of the month after the policy's effective date or on the date the court, or the department in a title IV-D case, is notified that insurance has been obtained, whichever is later.  If the private insurance terminates, the cash medical support order automatically resumes by operation of law on the first day of the month following the termination date of the policy.

2. Order one parent to provide medical insurance when it becomes accessible and available at a reasonable cost.

3. Order that medical costs in excess of the cash medical support amount shall be paid by each parent according to the percentage assigned for payment of uninsured costs.

L. In a title IV-D case, if the court orders the noncustodial parent to obtain medical insurance the court shall also set an alternative cash medical support order to be paid by that parent if the child is not covered under an insurance plan within ninety days after entry of the order or if the child is no longer covered by insurance.  The court shall not order the custodial parent to pay cash medical support.

M. In title IV-D cases the superior court shall accept for filing any documents that are received through electronic transmission if the electronically reproduced document states that the copy used for the electronic transmission was certified before it was electronically transmitted.

N. The court shall presume, in the absence of contrary testimony, that a parent is capable of full-time employment at least at the applicable state or federal adult minimum wage, whichever is higher.  This presumption does not apply to noncustodial parents who are under eighteen years of age and who are attending high school.

O. An order for support shall provide for an assignment pursuant to sections 25-504 and 25-323.

P. Each licensing board or agency that issues professional, recreational or occupational licenses or certificates shall record on the application the social security number of the applicant and shall enter this information in its database in order to aid the department of economic security in locating parents or their assets or to enforce child support orders.  This subsection does not apply to a license that is issued pursuant to title 17 and that is not issued by an automated drawing system. If a licensing board or agency allows an applicant to use a number other than the social security number on the face of the license or certificate while the licensing board or agency keeps the social security number on file, the licensing board or agency shall advise an applicant of this fact.

Q. The factors prescribed pursuant to subsection D of this section are stated for direction to the supreme court.  Except pursuant to subsection E of this section and sections 25-501 and 25-809, the superior court shall not consider the factors when making child support orders, independent of the child support guidelines.

R. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Accessible" means that insurance is available in the geographic region where the child resides.

2. "Child support guidelines" means the child support guidelines that are adopted by the state supreme court pursuant to 42 United States Code sections 651 through 669B.

3. "Date of separation" means the date the married parents ceased to cohabit.

A. A decree of dissolution of marriage or of legal separation is final when entered, subject to the right of appeal.

The provisions as to property disposition may not be revoked or modified, unless the court finds the existence of conditions that justify the reopening of a judgment under the laws of this state. Modifications and terminations are effective on the first day of the month following notice of the petition for modification or termination unless the court, for good cause shown, orders the change to become effective at a different date but not earlier than the date of filing the petition for modification or termination.

B. Unless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the decree, the obligation to pay future maintenance is terminated on the death of either party or the remarriage of the party receiving maintenance.

C. Unless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly provided in the decree, provisions for the support of a minor child are not terminated by the death of a parent obligated to support the child. If a parent obligated to pay support dies, the amount of future support may be modified, revoked or commuted to a lump sum payment to the extent just and appropriate in the circumstances and has priority equal to the right for family allowance in section 14-2404.  Past due support has priority equal to claims provided for in section 14-3805, subsection A, paragraph 6.

D. Notwithstanding any other law, pursuant to a petition filed pursuant to this section the court may suspend the imposition of future interest that accrues on a judgment for support issued pursuant to this article for the period of time that the petitioner is incarcerated or has physical or mental disabilities to the extent that the person is unable to maintain employment.

 

#### Section 25-328. Sequence of trials when custody or parenting time is an issue

A. In all cases when custody or parenting time is a contested issue, the court shall first hear and decide all other issues including maintenance and child support if requested to do so by the petitioner, the respondent or the child's attorney.

#### Section 25-381.22. Subsequent petition filed within one year

Once a petition by either or both of the spouses has been filed as permitted by section 25-381.09, the filing of any subsequent petition under such section within one year thereafter by either or both of the spouses shall not stay any action for annulment, dissolution of marriage, or legal separation then pending nor prohibit the filing of such an action by either party. The filing of a subsequent petition by either or both of the spouses more than one year after the filing of any previous petition with such effect shall have the same effect toward staying any domestic relations action then pending and toward prohibiting the filing of any such action as provided in section 25-381.18.

#### Section 25-381.23. Option for mandatory conciliation

In those counties in which the superior court has by rule or order established a conciliation court, the judge or judges of the conciliation court may, by local rule, with the approval of the presiding judge of the superior court in that county, require one or more hearings or conferences at which the parties must attend in order to further the purposes of this article.

#### Section 25-402. Jurisdiction

A. Before it conducts a proceeding concerning legal decision-making or parenting time, including a proceeding to determine the legal decision-making or visitation of a nonparent, a court in this state first must confirm its authority to do so to the exclusion of any other state, Indian tribe or foreign nation by complying with the uniform child custody jurisdiction and enforcement act, the parental kidnapping prevention act and any applicable international law concerning the wrongful abduction or removal of children.

B. The following persons may request legal decision-making or parenting time under the following circumstances:

1. A parent in any proceeding for marital dissolution, legal separation, annulment, paternity or modification of an earlier decree or judgment.

2. A person other than a parent, by filing a petition for third party rights under section 25-409 in the county in which the child permanently resides.

 

#### Section 25-403. Legal decision-making; best interests of child

A. The court shall determine legal decision-making and parenting time, either originally or on petition for modification, in accordance with the best interests of the child. The court shall consider all factors that are relevant to the child's physical and emotional well-being, including:

1. The past, present and potential future relationship between the parent and the child.

2. The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child's parent or parents, the child's siblings and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interest.

3. The child's adjustment to home, school and community.

4. If the child is of suitable age and maturity, the wishes of the child as to legal decision-making and parenting time.

5. The mental and physical health of all individuals involved.

6. Which parent is more likely to allow the child frequent, meaningful and continuing contact with the other parent.  This paragraph does not apply if the court determines that a parent is acting in good faith to protect the child from witnessing an act of domestic violence or being a victim of domestic violence or child abuse.

7. Whether one parent intentionally misled the court to cause an unnecessary delay, to increase the cost of litigation or to persuade the court to give a legal decision-making or a parenting time preference to that parent.

8. Whether there has been domestic violence or child abuse pursuant to section 25-403.03.

9. The nature and extent of coercion or duress used by a parent in obtaining an agreement regarding legal decision-making or parenting time.

10. Whether a parent has complied with chapter 3, article 5 of this title.

11. Whether either parent was convicted of an act of false reporting of child abuse or neglect under section 13-2907.02.

B. In a contested legal decision-making or parenting time case, the court shall make specific findings on the record about all relevant factors and the reasons for which the decision is in the best interests of the child.

 

#### Section 25-403.01. Sole and joint legal decision-making and parenting time

A. In awarding legal decision-making, the court may order sole legal decision-making or joint legal decision-making.

B. In determining the level of decision-making that is in the child's best interests, the court shall consider the factors prescribed in section 25-403, subsection A and all of the following:

1. The agreement or lack of an agreement by the parents regarding joint legal decision-making.

2. Whether a parent's lack of an agreement is unreasonable or is influenced by an issue not related to the child's best interests.

3. The past, present and future abilities of the parents to cooperate in decision-making about the child to the extent required by the order of joint legal decision-making.

4. Whether the joint legal decision-making arrangement is logistically possible.

C. An order for sole legal decision-making does not allow the parent designated as sole legal decision-maker to alter unilaterally a court-ordered parenting time plan.

D. A parent who is not granted sole or joint legal decision-making is entitled to reasonable parenting time to ensure that the minor child has substantial, frequent, meaningful and continuing contact with the parent unless the court finds, after a hearing, that parenting time would endanger the child's physical, mental, moral or emotional health.

 

#### Section 25-403.02. Parenting plans

A. If the child's parents cannot agree on a plan for legal decision-making or parenting time, each parent must submit a proposed parenting plan.

B. Consistent with the child's best interests in section 25-403 and sections 25-403.03, 25-403.04 and 25-403.05, the court shall adopt a parenting plan that provides for both parents to share legal decision-making regarding their child and that maximizes their respective parenting time.  The court shall not prefer a parent's proposed plan because of the parent's or child's gender.

C. Parenting plans shall include at least the following:

1. A designation of the legal decision-making as joint or sole as defined in section 25-401.

2. Each parent's rights and responsibilities for the personal care of the child and for decisions in areas such as education, health care and religious training.

3. A practical schedule of parenting time for the child, including holidays and school vacations.

4. A procedure for the exchanges of the child, including location and responsibility for transportation.

5. A procedure by which proposed changes, relocation of where a child resides with either parent pursuant to section 25-408, disputes and alleged breaches may be mediated or resolved, which may include the use of conciliation services or private counseling.

6. A procedure for periodic review of the plan's terms by the parents.

7. A procedure for communicating with each other about the child, including methods and frequency.

8. A statement that each party has read, understands and will abide by the notification requirements of section 25-403.05, subsection B.

D. If the parents are unable to agree on any element to be included in a parenting plan, the court shall determine that element. The court may determine other factors that are necessary to promote and protect the emotional and physical health of the child.

E. Shared legal decision-making does not necessarily mean equal parenting time.

 

#### Section 25-403.03. Domestic violence and child abuse

A. Notwithstanding subsection D of this section, joint legal decision-making shall not be awarded if the court makes a finding of the existence of significant domestic violence pursuant to section 13-3601 or if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a significant history of domestic violence.

B. The court shall consider evidence of domestic violence as being contrary to the best interests of the child.  The court shall consider the safety and well-being of the child and of the victim of the act of domestic violence to be of primary importance. The court shall consider a perpetrator's history of causing or threatening to cause physical harm to another person.

C. To determine if a person has committed an act of domestic violence the court, subject to the rules of evidence, shall consider all relevant factors including the following:

1. Findings from another court of competent jurisdiction.

2. Police reports.

3. Medical reports.

4. Records of the department of child safety.

5. Domestic violence shelter records.

6. School records.

7. Witness testimony.

D. If the court determines that a parent who is seeking sole or joint legal decision-making has committed an act of domestic violence against the other parent, there is a rebuttable presumption that an award of sole or joint legal decision-making to the parent who committed the act of domestic violence is contrary to the child's best interests.  This presumption does not apply if both parents have committed an act of domestic violence.  For the purposes of this subsection, a person commits an act of domestic violence if that person does any of the following:

1. Intentionally, knowingly or recklessly causes or attempts to cause sexual assault or serious physical injury.

2. Places a person in reasonable apprehension of imminent serious physical injury to any person.

3. Engages in a pattern of behavior for which a court may issue an ex parte order to protect the other parent who is seeking child custody or to protect the child and the child's siblings.

E. To determine if the parent has rebutted the presumption the court shall consider all of the following:

1. Whether the parent has demonstrated that being awarded sole or joint legal decision-making or substantially equal parenting time is in the child's best interests.

2. Whether the parent has successfully completed a batterer's prevention program.

3. Whether the parent has successfully completed a program of alcohol or drug abuse counseling, if the court determines that counseling is appropriate.

4. Whether the parent has successfully completed a parenting class, if the court determines that a parenting class is appropriate.

5. If the parent is on probation, parole or community supervision, whether the parent is restrained by a protective order that was granted after a hearing.

6. Whether the parent has committed any further acts of domestic violence.

F. If the court finds that a parent has committed an act of domestic violence, that parent has the burden of proving to the court's satisfaction that parenting time will not endanger the child or significantly impair the child's emotional development. If the parent meets this burden to the court's satisfaction, the court shall place conditions on parenting time that best protect the child and the other parent from further harm. The court may:

1. Order that an exchange of the child must occur in a protected setting as specified by the court.

2. Order that an agency specified by the court must supervise parenting time. If the court allows a family or household member to supervise parenting time, the court shall establish conditions that this person must follow during parenting time.

3. Order the parent who committed the act of domestic violence to attend and complete, to the court's satisfaction, a program of intervention for perpetrators of domestic violence and any other counseling the court orders.

4. Order the parent who committed the act of domestic violence to abstain from possessing or consuming alcohol or controlled substances during parenting time and for twenty-four hours before parenting time.

5. Order the parent who committed the act of domestic violence to pay a fee for the costs of supervised parenting time.

6. Prohibit overnight parenting time.

7. Require a bond from the parent who committed the act of domestic violence for the child's safe return.

8. Order that the address of the child and the other parent remain confidential.

9. Impose any other condition that the court determines is necessary to protect the child, the other parent and any other family or household member.

G. The court shall not order joint counseling between a victim and the perpetrator of domestic violence. The court may provide a victim with written information about available community resources related to domestic violence.

H. The court may request or order the services of the department of child safety if the court believes that a child may be the victim of child abuse or neglect as defined in section 8-201.

I. In determining whether the absence or relocation of a parent shall be weighed against that parent in determining legal decision-making or parenting time, the court may consider whether the absence or relocation was caused by an act of domestic violence by the other parent.

 

#### Section 25-403.04. Substance abuse

A. If the court determines that a parent has abused drugs or alcohol or has been convicted of any drug offense under title 13, chapter 34 or any violation of section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383 within twelve months before the petition or the request for legal decision-making or parenting time is filed, there is a rebuttable presumption that sole or joint legal decision-making by that parent is not in the child's best interests.  In making this determination the court shall state its:

1. Findings of fact that support its determination that the parent abused drugs or alcohol or was convicted of the offense.

2. Findings that the legal decision-making or parenting time arrangement ordered by the court appropriately protects the child.

B. To determine if the person has rebutted the presumption, at a minimum the court shall consider the following evidence:

1. The absence of any conviction of any other drug offense during the previous five years.

2. Results of random drug testing for a six month period that indicate that the person is not using drugs as proscribed by title 13, chapter 34.

3. Results of alcohol or drug screening provided by a facility approved by the department of health services.

 

#### Section 25-403.05. Sexual offenders; murderers; legal decision-making and parenting time; notification of risk to child

A. Unless the court finds that there is no significant risk to the child and states its reasons in writing, the court shall not grant a person sole or joint legal decision-making of a child or unsupervised parenting time with a child if the person:

1. Is a registered sex offender.

2. Has been convicted of murder in the first degree and the victim of the murder was the other parent of the child who is the subject of the order. In making its finding, the court may consider, among other factors, the following:

(a) Credible evidence that the convicted parent was a victim of domestic violence, as defined in section 13-3601, committed by the murdered parent.

(b) Testimony of an expert witness that the convicted parent suffered trauma from abuse committed by the murdered parent.

B. A child's parent or custodian must immediately notify the other parent or custodian if the parent or custodian knows that a convicted or registered sex offender or a person who has been convicted of a dangerous crime against children as defined in section 13-705 may have access to the child.  The parent or custodian must provide notice by first class mail, return receipt requested, by electronic means to an electronic mail address that the recipient provided to the parent or custodian for notification purposes or by other communication accepted by the court.

 

#### Section 25-403.06. Parental access to prescription medication and records

A. Unless otherwise provided by court order or law, on reasonable request both parents are entitled to have equal access to prescription medication, documents and other information concerning the child's education and physical, mental, moral and emotional health including medical, school, police, court and other records directly from the custodian of the records or from the other parent.

B. A person who does not comply with a reasonable request shall reimburse the requesting parent for court costs and attorney fees incurred by that parent to force compliance with this section.

C. A parent with joint legal custody shall not designate one pharmacy in a single location as the only source of the child's prescription medication without agreement of the other parent.

D. A parent who attempts to restrict the release of documents or information by the custodian or attempts to withhold prescription medication without a prior court order is subject to appropriate legal sanctions.

 

#### Section 25-403.07. Identification of a primary caretaker and public assistance

The court may specify one parent as the primary caretaker of the child and one home as the primary home of the child for the purposes of defining eligibility for public assistance. This finding does not diminish the rights of either parent and does not create a presumption for or against either parent in a proceeding for the modification of a legal decision-making or parenting time order.

 

#### Section 25-403.08. Resources and fees

A. In a proceeding regarding sole or joint legal decision-making or parenting time, either party may request attorney fees, costs and expert witness fees to enable the party with insufficient resources to obtain adequate legal representation and to prepare evidence for the hearing.

B. If the court finds there is a financial disparity between the parties, the court may order payment of reasonable fees, expenses and costs to allow adequate preparation.

 

#### Section 25-403.09. Child support

A. For any parenting time order entered under this article, the court shall determine an amount of child support in accordance with section 25-320 and guidelines established pursuant to that section.

B. An award of joint legal decision-making or a substantially equal parenting time plan does not diminish the responsibility of either parent to provide for the support of the child.

 

#### Section 25-404. Temporary orders

A. A party to a legal decision-making and parenting time proceeding may move for a temporary order. This motion must be supported by pleadings as provided in section 25-411. The court may award temporary legal decision-making and parenting time under the standards of section 25-403 after a hearing, or, if there is no objection, solely on the basis of the pleadings.

B. If a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation is dismissed, any temporary legal decision-making or parenting time order is vacated unless a parent or the child's custodian moves that the proceeding continue as a legal decision-making or parenting time proceeding and the court finds, after a hearing, that the circumstances of the parents and the best interest of the child require that a legal decision-making or parenting time plan decree be issued.

C. If a legal decision-making or parenting time proceeding commenced in the absence of a petition for dissolution of marriage or legal separation is dismissed, any temporary custody order thereby is vacated.

 

#### Section 25-405. Interviews by court; professional assistance

A. The court may interview the child in chambers to ascertain the child's wishes as to the child's custodian and as to parenting time.

B. The court may seek the advice of professional personnel, whether or not employed by the court on a regular basis. The advice given shall be in writing and shall be made available by the court to counsel, on request, under such terms as the court determines. Counsel may examine as a witness any professional personnel consulted by the court, unless that right is waived.

#### Section 25-406. Investigations and reports

A. In contested legal decision-making and parenting time proceedings, and in other custody proceedings if a parent or the child's custodian so requests, the court may order an investigation and report concerning legal decision-making or parenting time arrangements for the child. The investigation and report may be made by the court social service agency, the staff of the juvenile court, the local probation or welfare department or a private person.  The report must include a written affirmation by the person completing the report that the person has met the training requirements prescribed in subsection C of this section.

B. If an investigation and report are ordered pursuant to this section or if the court appoints a family court advisor, the court shall allocate cost based on the financial circumstances of both parties.

C. The court shall require a court appointed attorney for a child, a court appointed advisor or any person who conducts an investigation or prepares a report pursuant to this section to receive training that meets the following minimum standards:

1. Six initial hours of training on domestic violence.

2. Six initial hours of child abuse training.

3. Four subsequent hours of training every two years on domestic violence and child abuse.

D. A person who has completed professional training to become licensed or certified may use that training to completely or partially fulfill the requirements in subsection C of this section if the training included at least six hours each on domestic violence and child abuse and meets the minimum standards.  Subsequent professional training in these subject matters may be used to partially or completely fulfill the training requirements prescribed in subsection C of this section if the training meets the minimum standards.

E. A physician who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 is exempt from the training requirements prescribed in subsection C of this section.

F. In preparing a report concerning a child, the investigator may consult any person who may have information about the child or the child's potential legal decision-making and parenting time arrangements.

G. The court shall mail the investigator's report to counsel at least ten days before the hearing. The investigator shall make available to counsel the names and addresses of all persons whom the investigator has consulted. Any party to the proceeding may call for examination of the investigator and any person consulted by the investigator.

 

#### Section 25-407. Legal decision-making and parenting time hearings; priority; costs; record

A. Legal decision-making and parenting time proceedings shall receive priority in being set for hearing.  If a party to a legal decision-making or parenting time action files a motion for temporary orders in any pre-decree matter, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing within sixty days after the party files the motion unless:

1. The filing party waives the requirement for a hearing to be conducted within sixty days after the party files the motion.

2. Temporary orders are established through a separate conference or hearing within sixty days after the party files the motion.

3. Extraordinary circumstances exist and the court is not able to schedule the hearing.  If the court is not able to schedule the hearing within sixty days after the motion is filed, it must make a written finding on the record as to the cause of the delay.

B. Subsection A of this section does not preclude any other conference or hearing.

C. The court may charge as costs the payment of necessary travel and other expenses incurred by any person whose presence at the hearing the court deems necessary to determine the best interest of the child.

D. The court, without a jury, shall determine questions of law and fact. If it finds that a public hearing may be detrimental to the child's best interest, the court may exclude the public from a custody hearing, but may admit any person who has a direct and legitimate interest in the particular case or a legitimate educational or research interest in the work of the court.

E. If the court finds that to protect the child's welfare, the record of any interview, report, investigation or testimony in a legal decision-making or parenting time proceeding should be kept secret, the court may then make an appropriate order sealing the record.

 

#### Section 25-408. Rights of each parent; parenting time; relocation of child; exception; enforcement; access to prescription medication and records

A. If by written agreement or court order both parents are entitled to joint legal decision-making or parenting time and both parents reside in the state, at least forty-five days' advance written notice shall be provided to the other parent before a parent may do either of the following:

1. Relocate the child outside the state.

2. Relocate the child more than one hundred miles within the state.

B. The notice required by this section shall be made by certified mail, return receipt requested, or pursuant to the Arizona rules of family law procedure. The court shall sanction a parent who, without good cause, does not comply with the notification requirements of this subsection.  The court may impose a sanction that will affect legal decision-making or parenting time only in accordance with the child's best interests.

C. Within thirty days after notice is made the nonmoving parent may petition the court to prevent relocation of the child. After expiration of this time any petition or other application to prevent relocation of the child may be granted only on a showing of good cause.  This subsection does not prohibit a parent who is seeking to relocate the child from petitioning the court for a hearing, on notice to the other parent, to determine the appropriateness of a relocation that may adversely affect the other parent's legal decision-making or parenting time rights.

D. Subsection A of this section does not apply if provision for relocation of a child has been made by a court order or a written agreement of the parties that is dated within one year of the proposed relocation of the child.

E. If a child is relocated pursuant to this section, unless otherwise ordered by the court, all parties must continue to comply with current court orders, regardless of distance moved or notice required.

F. Pending the determination by the court of a petition or application to prevent relocation of the child:

1. A parent with sole legal decision-making or a parent with joint legal decision-making and primary residence of a child who is required by circumstances of health, safety, employment or eviction of that parent or that parent's spouse to relocate in less than forty-five days after written notice has been given to the other parent may temporarily relocate with the child.

2. A parent who shares joint legal decision-making and substantially equal parenting time and who is required by circumstances of health, safety, employment or eviction of that parent or that parent's spouse to relocate in less than forty-five days after written notice has been given to the other parent may temporarily relocate with the child only if both parents execute a written agreement to permit relocation of the child.

G. The court shall determine whether to allow the parent to relocate the child in accordance with the child's best interests. The burden of proving what is in the child's best interests is on the parent who is seeking to relocate the child.  To the extent practicable the court shall also make appropriate arrangements to ensure the continuation of a meaningful relationship between the child and both parents.

H. The court shall not deviate from a provision of any parenting plan or other written agreement by which the parents specifically have agreed to allow or prohibit relocation of the child unless the court finds that the provision is no longer in the child's best interests. There is a rebuttable presumption that a provision from any parenting plan or other written agreement is in the child's best interests.

I. In determining the child's best interests the court shall consider all relevant factors including:

1. The factors prescribed under section 25-403.

2. Whether the relocation is being made or opposed in good faith and not to interfere with or to frustrate the relationship between the child and the other parent or the other parent's right of access to the child.

3. The prospective advantage of the move for improving the general quality of life for the custodial parent or for the child.

4. The likelihood that the parent with whom the child will reside after the relocation will comply with parenting time orders.

5. Whether the relocation will allow a realistic opportunity for parenting time with each parent.

6. The extent to which moving or not moving will affect the emotional, physical or developmental needs of the child.

7. The motives of the parents and the validity of the reasons given for moving or opposing the move including the extent to which either parent may intend to gain a financial advantage regarding continuing child support obligations.

8. The potential effect of relocation on the child's stability.

J. The court shall assess attorney fees and court costs against either parent if the court finds that the parent has unreasonably denied, restricted or interfered with court-ordered parenting time.

K. Pursuant to section 25-403.06, each parent is entitled to have access to prescription medication, documents and other information about the child unless the court finds that access would endanger seriously the child's or a parent's physical, mental, moral or emotional health.

 

#### Section 25-409. Third party rights

A. Pursuant to section 25-402, subsection B, paragraph 2, a person other than a legal parent may petition the superior court for legal decision-making authority or placement of the child. The court shall summarily deny a petition unless it finds that the petitioner's initial pleading establishes that all of the following are true:

1. The person filing the petition stands in loco parentis to the child.

2. It would be significantly detrimental to the child to remain or be placed in the care of either legal parent who wishes to keep or acquire legal decision-making.

3. A court of competent jurisdiction has not entered or approved an order concerning legal decision-making or parenting time within one year before the person filed a petition pursuant to this section, unless there is reason to believe the child's present environment may seriously endanger the child's physical, mental, moral or emotional health.

4. One of the following applies:

(a) One of the legal parents is deceased.

(b) The child's legal parents are not married to each other at the time the petition is filed.

(c) A proceeding for dissolution of marriage or for legal separation of the legal parents is pending at the time the petition is filed.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, it is a rebuttable presumption that awarding legal decision-making to a legal parent serves the child's best interests because of the physical, psychological and emotional needs of the child to be reared by a legal parent. A third party may rebut this presumption only with proof showing by clear and convincing evidence that awarding legal decision-making to a legal parent is not consistent with the child's best interests.

C. Pursuant to section 25-402, subsection B, paragraph 2, a person other than a legal parent may petition the superior court for visitation with a child.  The superior court may grant visitation rights during the child's minority on a finding that the visitation is in the child's best interests and that any of the following is true:

1. One of the legal parents is deceased or has been missing at least three months. For the purposes of this paragraph, a parent is considered to be missing if the parent's location has not been determined and the parent has been reported as missing to a law enforcement agency.

2. The child was born out of wedlock and the child's legal parents are not married to each other at the time the petition is filed.

3. For grandparent or great-grandparent visitation, the marriage of the parents of the child has been dissolved for at least three months.

4. For in loco parentis visitation, a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or for legal separation of the legal parents is pending at the time the petition is filed.

D. A petition filed under subsection A or C of this section must be verified or supported by affidavit and must include detailed facts supporting the petitioner's claim. The petitioner must also provide notice of this proceeding, including a copy of the petition and any affidavits or other attachments, and serve the notice pursuant to the Arizona rules of family law procedure to all of the following:

1. The child's legal parents.

2. A third party who possesses legal decision-making authority over the child or visitation rights.

3. The child's guardian or guardian ad litem.

4. A person or agency that possesses physical custody of the child or claims legal decision-making authority or visitation rights concerning the child.

5. Any other person or agency that has previously appeared in the action.

E. In deciding whether to grant visitation to a third party, the court shall give special weight to the legal parents' opinion of what serves their child's best interests and consider all relevant factors including:

1. The historical relationship, if any, between the child and the person seeking visitation.

2. The motivation of the requesting party seeking visitation.

3. The motivation of the person objecting to visitation.

4. The quantity of visitation time requested and the potential adverse impact that visitation will have on the child's customary activities.

5. If one or both of the child's parents are deceased, the benefit in maintaining an extended family relationship.

F. If logistically possible and appropriate, the court shall order visitation by a grandparent or great-grandparent if the child is residing or spending time with the parent through whom the grandparent or great-grandparent claims a right of access to the child.

G. A grandparent or great-grandparent seeking visitation rights under this section shall petition in the same action in which the family court previously decided legal decision-making and parenting time or, if no such case existed, by separate petition in the county of the child's home state, as defined in section 25-1002.

H. All visitation rights granted under this section automatically terminate if the child is adopted or placed for adoption.  If the child is removed from an adoptive placement, the court may reinstate the visitation rights. This subsection does not apply if the child is adopted by the spouse of a natural parent after the natural parent remarries.

I. For the purposes of this section, a child who is adopted may be treated as if born in lawful wedlock only if the child is adopted jointly by parents who are married to one another as provided in section 8-103, subsection A.

#### Section 25-410. Judicial supervision

A. Except as otherwise agreed by the parties in writing at the time of the legal decision-making or parenting time order or divorce decree, the parent designated as sole legal decision-maker may determine the child's upbringing, including the child's education, care, health care and religious training, unless, on motion by the other parent, the court, after a hearing, finds that in the absence of a specific limitation of the parent designated as the sole legal decision-maker's authority, the child's physical health would be endangered or the child's emotional development would be significantly impaired.

B. If either parent requests the order, or if all contestants agree to the order, or if the court finds that in the absence of the order the child's physical health would be endangered or the child's emotional development would be significantly impaired, and if the court finds that the best interests of the child would be served, the court shall order a local social service agency to exercise continuing supervision over the case to assure that the custodial or parenting time terms of the decree are carried out. At the discretion of the court, reasonable fees for the supervision may be charged to one or both parents, provided that the fees have been approved by the supreme court.

 

#### Section 25-411. Modification of legal decision-making or parenting time; affidavit; contents; military families

A. A person shall not make a motion to modify a legal decision-making or parenting time decree earlier than one year after its date, unless the court permits it to be made on the basis of affidavits that there is reason to believe the child's present environment may seriously endanger the child's physical, mental, moral or emotional health. At any time after a joint legal decision-making order is entered, a parent may petition the court for modification of the order on the basis of evidence that domestic violence involving a violation of section 13-1201 or 13-1204, spousal abuse or child abuse occurred since the entry of the joint legal decision-making order. Six months after a joint legal decision-making order is entered, a parent may petition the court for modification of the order based on the failure of the other parent to comply with the provisions of the order. A motion or petition to modify an order shall meet the requirements of this section.  Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a parent is a member of the United States armed forces, the court shall consider the terms of that parent's military family care plan to determine what is in the child's best interest during that parent's military deployment.

B. If the parent with whom the parent's child resides a majority of the time receives temporary duty, deployment, activation or mobilization orders from the United States military that involve moving a substantial distance away from the parent's residence a court shall not enter a final order modifying parental rights and responsibilities and parent-child contact in an existing order until ninety days after the deployment ends, unless a modification is agreed to by the deploying parent.

C. The court shall not consider a parent's absence caused by deployment or mobilization or the potential for future deployment or mobilization as the sole factor supporting a real, substantial and unanticipated change in circumstances pursuant to this section.

D. On motion of a deploying or nondeploying, mobilizing or absent military parent, the court, after a hearing, shall enter a temporary order modifying parental rights and responsibilities or parent-child contact during the period of deployment or mobilization if:

1. A military parent who has legal decision-making or parenting time pursuant to an existing court order has received notice from military leadership that the military parent will deploy or mobilize in the near future.

2. The deployment or mobilization would have a material effect on the military parent's ability to exercise parental rights and responsibilities or parent-child contact.

E. On motion of a deploying parent, if reasonable advance notice is given and good cause is shown, the court shall allow that parent to present testimony and evidence by electronic means with respect to parenting time or parent-child contact matters instituted pursuant to this section if the deployment of that parent has a material effect on that parent's ability to appear in person at a regularly scheduled hearing.  For the purposes of this subsection, "electronic means" includes communication by telephone or video teleconference.

F. The court shall hear motions for modification because of deployment as expeditiously as possible.

G. If a military parent receives military temporary duty, deployment, activation or mobilization orders that involve moving a substantial distance away from the military parent's residence or that otherwise have a material effect on the military parent's ability to exercise parenting time, at the request of the military parent, for the duration of the military parent's absence the court may delegate the military parent's parenting time, or a portion of that time, to a child's family member, including a stepparent, or to another person who is not the child's parent but who has a close and substantial relationship to the minor child, if the court determines that is in the child's best interest.  The court shall not allow the delegation of parenting time to a person who would be subject to limitations on parenting time.  The parties shall attempt to resolve disputes regarding delegation of parenting time through the dispute resolution process specified in their parenting plan, unless excused by the court for good cause shown.  A court order pursuant to this subsection does not establish separate rights to parenting time for a person other than a parent.

H. All temporary modification orders pursuant to this section shall include a specific transition schedule to facilitate a return to the predeployment order within ten days after the deployment ends, taking into consideration the child's best interests.

I. A decree or order that a court enters in contemplation of or during the military deployment of a parent outside of the continental United States shall specifically reference the deployment and include provisions governing the legal decision-making or parenting time arrangements, or both, of the minor child after the deployment ends.  Either parent may file a petition with the court after the deployment ends to modify the decree or order, in compliance with subsection L of this section. The court shall hold a hearing or conference on the petition within thirty days after the petition is filed.

J. The court may modify an order granting or denying parenting time rights whenever modification would serve the best interest of the child, but the court shall not restrict a parent's parenting time rights unless it finds that the parenting time would endanger seriously the child's physical, mental, moral or emotional health.

K. If after a legal decision-making or parenting time order is in effect one of the parents is charged with a dangerous crime against children as defined in section 13-705, child molestation as defined in section 13-1410 or an act of domestic violence as prescribed in section 13-3601 in which the victim is a minor, the other parent may petition the court for an expedited hearing.  Pending the expedited hearing, the court may suspend parenting time or change legal decision-making ex parte.

L. To modify any type of legal decision-making or parenting time order a person shall submit an affidavit or verified petition setting forth detailed facts supporting the requested modification and shall give notice, together with a copy of the affidavit or verified petition, to other parties to the proceeding, who may file opposing affidavits.  The court shall deny the motion unless it finds that adequate cause for hearing the motion is established by the pleadings, in which case it shall set a date for hearing on why the requested modification should not be granted.

M. The court shall assess attorney fees and costs against a party seeking modification if the court finds that the modification action is vexatious and constitutes harassment.

N. Subsection L of this section does not apply if the requested relief is for the modification or clarification of parenting time and not for a change of legal decision-making.

#### Section 25-414. Violation of visitation or parenting time rights; penalties

A. If the court, based on a verified petition and after it gives reasonable notice to an alleged violating parent and an opportunity for that person to be heard, finds that a parent has refused without good cause to comply with a visitation or parenting time order, the court shall do at least one of the following:

1. Find the violating parent in contempt of court.

C. Court costs and attorney fees incurred by the nonviolating parent associated with the review of noncompliance with a visitation or parenting time order shall be paid by the violating parent. In the event the custodial parent prevails, the court in its discretion may award court costs and attorney fees to the custodial parent.

 

 

#### Section 25-415. Sanctions for litigation misconduct

A. The court shall sanction a litigant for costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred by an adverse party if the court finds that the litigant has done any one or more of the following:

1. Knowingly presented a false claim under section 25-403, 25-403.03 or 25-403.04 with knowledge that the claim was false.

2. Knowingly accused an adverse party of making a false claim under section 25-403, 25-403.03 or 25-403.04 with knowledge that the claim was actually true.

In the case of children with mental or physical disabilities, if the court, after considering the factors set forth in section 25-320, subsection D, deems it appropriate, the court may order support to continue past the age of majority. If a child reaches the age of majority while the child is attending high school or a certified high school equivalency program, support shall continue to be provided while the child is actually attending high school or the equivalency program but only until the child reaches nineteen years of age unless the court enters an order pursuant to section 25-320, subsection E.

D. All duties of support as prescribed in this chapter may be enforced by all civil and criminal remedies provided by law.

E. Remedies provided by this chapter are cumulative and do not affect the availability of remedies under other law.

F. The court may determine that a parent is not obligated to contribute to the support of the parent's minor child if maternity or paternity is the result of the parent's sexual contact with a person who, as a result of that contact, has been found guilty of sexual conduct with a minor under section 13-1405 or sexual assault under section 13-1406. The court may also apply this exemption to the parent's parents or legal guardian.

G. In any action filed pursuant to this title, if a duty of support for another person exists or may exist the parties shall file the social security number of each party and any affected children in the record of the proceeding in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Arizona rules of family law relating to sensitive data.  The court shall include this information in the state case registry and shall maintain this information in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of the Arizona rules of family law relating to sensitive data.

 

#### Section 25-502. Jurisdiction, venue and procedure; additional enforcement provisions

A. The superior court has original jurisdiction in proceedings brought by the department, its agents, a person having physical custody of a child or a party to the case to establish, enforce or modify the duties of support as prescribed in this chapter. All such proceedings are civil actions except as provided in section 25-511. Proceedings to enforce the duties of support as prescribed in this chapter may be originated in the county of residence of the respondent or the petitioner or of the child or children who are the subject of the action.

B. A proceeding to establish support must originate in the county where the child resides or, if the child resides out of state, the county of this state where the party filing the petition to establish support resides, if either of the following applies:

1. An action does not exist under this title.

2. Paternity was established without a court order pursuant to section 36-334.

C. A person or the department or its agent must file a petition to establish or modify a child support order in the superior court in the county of the last order issued under this title if an order exists in this state. If a person wishes the case transferred to the county of this state where the child resides or, if the child resides out of state, the county of this state where the party requesting the transfer resides, the person must file a request for transfer with the clerk of the superior court that issued the last order.

D. A request for transfer pursuant to subsection C of this section must include a petition or motion regarding support, a statement of payments in default, if applicable, and the transmittal fee prescribed in section 12-284. The responding party may object to the transfer by filing an objection and affidavit within twenty days after service of the request to transfer.

E. If the clerk does not receive an objection and affidavit pursuant to subsection D of this section, the clerk shall issue the transfer order and transfer the proceeding and all related court files to the other county within thirty days after service of the request to transfer.  If the clerk receives an objection and affidavit within the time prescribed in subsection D of this section, the clerk shall notify all parties of the date of the hearing at least ten days before the hearing date.  The court may hear evidence relevant only to the issue of the transfer.  If after that hearing the court orders the transfer, the clerk shall transfer the proceeding and court files within ten days after the order.  The county to which the transfer is made retains the court files and venue for all purposes and the transferring county shall not retain a copy of those files.

F. The county to which a transfer is made pursuant to subsection D or E of this section shall proceed as if the proceeding was brought in that county originally.  A judgment from that county has the same effect and may be enforced or modified as a judgment from the original county.

G. The party who petitioned for transfer must pay the postadjudication fee prescribed in section 12-284 to the county to which the proceeding was transferred within ten days after the date the clerk of the court mails the notice of the requirement to pay the postadjudication fee.  If the party does not pay the fee by that date, the transfer order is automatically nullified and the court clerk shall return the proceeding and all related court files to the original county.

H. Except as provided in section 25-510, in title IV-D cases the superior court shall accept for filing any documents that are received through electronic transmission if the electronically reproduced document states that the copy used for the electronic transmission was certified before it was electronically transmitted.

I. On filing of the petition and, if applicable, after a transfer is completed, the court shall issue an order requiring the responding party to appear at the time and place set for the hearing on the petition. Service of the order and a copy of the petition shall be as provided in the Arizona rules of family law procedure.  If the responding party receives notice of a hearing but fails to appear, the court may issue a child support arrest warrant as provided in article 5 of this chapter and shall require that the responding party pay at the time of arrest an amount set by the court to secure the responding party's release from custody pending an appearance at the next scheduled hearing. The court also may find the party to be in contempt of court pursuant to section 12-864.01 and set an amount to be paid to purge the contempt. Any purge amount set by the court shall supersede the amount required to be set to secure the responding party's release, and the responding party shall pay only the purge amount as a condition of release from custody.  Any amounts paid under this section shall be deposited with the clerk of the court or the support payment clearinghouse and credited first to the responding party's current child support obligation and then to arrearages.  The court may grant a default judgment for arrearages on a prima facie showing of the amount due.

J. The department or its agent or a parent, guardian or custodian may file with the clerk of the superior court a request to establish child support.  The request must include a proposed order, the worksheet for child support and a notice of the right to request a hearing within twenty days after service in this state or within thirty days after service outside this state.  The request, proposed order, worksheet and notice shall be served pursuant to the Arizona rules of family law procedure on all parties, and in a title IV-D case, on the department or its agent.  In a title IV-D case, the department or its agent may serve all parties by certified mail, return receipt requested. If a party does not request a hearing within the time prescribed by this subsection, the court shall review the proposed order and worksheet and enter an appropriate order or set the matter for a hearing. In a title IV-D case, the department or its agent shall enforce the order.

K. Each licensing board or agency that issues professional, recreational or occupational licenses or certificates shall record on the application the social security number of the applicant and shall enter this information in its database in order to aid the department of economic security in locating parents or their assets or to enforce child support orders.  This subsection does not apply to a license that is issued pursuant to title 17 and that is not issued by an automated drawing system.  If a licensing board or agency allows an applicant to use a number other than the social security number on the face of the license or certificate while the licensing board or agency keeps the social security number on file, the licensing board or agency shall advise an applicant of this fact.

 

#### Section 25-503. Order for support; methods of payment; modification; termination; statute of limitations; judgment on arrearages; notice; security

A. In any proceeding in which there is at issue the support of a child, the court may order either or both parents to pay any amount necessary for the support of the child. If the court order does not specify the date when current support begins, the support obligation begins to accrue on the first day of the month following the entry of the order.  If any form of payment is rightfully dishonored by the payor bank or other drawee, any subsequent support payments and handling fees shall be paid only by cash, money order, cashier's check, traveler's check or certified check. The department may collect from the drawer of a dishonored payment an amount allowed pursuant to section 44-6852. Pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, the department shall deposit monies collected pursuant to this subsection in a child support enforcement administration fund. If a party required to pay support by guaranteed means demonstrates full and timely payment for twenty-four consecutive months, that party may pay support by regularly accepted forms of payment if these payments are for the full amount, are timely tendered and are not rightfully dishonored by the payor bank or other drawee. On a showing of good cause, the court may order that the party or parties required to pay support give reasonable security for these payments. If the court sets an appearance bond and the obligor fails to appear, the bond is forfeited and credited against any support owed by the party required to pay support.  This subsection does not apply to payments that are made by means of a wage assignment.

B. On a showing that an income withholding order has been ineffective to secure the timely payment of support and that an amount equal to six months of current support has accrued, the court shall require the obligor to give security, post bond or give some other guarantee to secure overdue support.

C. In title IV-D cases, and in all other cases subject to an income withholding order issued on or after January 1, 1994, after notice to the party entitled to receive support, the department or its agent may direct the party obligated to pay support or other payor to make payment to the support payment clearinghouse. The department or its agent shall provide notice by first class mail.

D. The obligation for current child support shall be fully met before any payments under an order of assignment may be applied to the payment of arrearages.  If a party is obligated to pay support for more than one family and the amount available is not sufficient to meet the total combined current support obligation, any monies shall be allocated to each family as follows:

1. The amount of current support ordered in each case shall be added to obtain the total support obligation.

2. The ordered amount in each case shall be divided by the total support obligation to obtain a percentage of the total amount due.

3. The amount available from the obligor's income shall be multiplied by the percentage under paragraph 2 of this subsection to obtain the amount to be allocated to each family.

E. Any order for child support may be modified or terminated on a showing of changed circumstance that is substantial and continuing, except as to any amount that may have accrued as an arrearage before the date of notice of the motion or order to show cause to modify or terminate.  The addition of health insurance coverage as defined in section 25-531 or a change in the availability of health insurance coverage may constitute a continuing and substantial change in circumstance. Modification and termination are effective on the first day of the month following notice of the petition for modification or termination unless the court, for good cause shown, orders the change to become effective at a different date but not earlier than the date of filing the petition for modification or termination. The order of modification or termination may include an award of attorney fees and court costs to the prevailing party.

F. On petition of a person who has been ordered to pay child support pursuant to a presumption of paternity established pursuant to section 25-814, the court may order the petitioner's support to terminate if the court finds based on clear and convincing evidence that paternity was established by fraud, duress or material mistake of fact.  Except for good cause shown, the petitioner's support obligations continue in effect until the court has ruled in favor of the petitioner.  The court shall order the petitioner, each child who is the subject of the petition and the child's mother to submit to genetic testing and shall order the appropriate testing procedures to determine the child's inherited characteristics, including blood and tissue type.  If the court finds that the petitioner is not the child's biological father, the court shall vacate the determination of paternity and terminate the support obligation.  Unless otherwise ordered by the court, an order vacating a support obligation is prospective and does not alter the petitioner's obligation to pay child support arrearages or any other amount previously ordered by the court.  If the court finds that it is in the child's best interests, the court may order the biological father to pay restitution to the petitioner for any child support paid before the court ruled in favor of the petitioner pursuant to this subsection.

G. Notwithstanding subsection E of this section, in a title IV-D case a party, or the department or its agent if there is an assignment of rights under section 46-407, may request every three years that an order for child support be reviewed and, if appropriate, adjusted. The request may be made without a specific showing of a changed circumstance that is substantial and continuing. The department or its agent shall conduct the review in accordance with the child support guidelines of this state.  If appropriate, the department shall file a petition in the superior court to adjust the support amount.  Every three years the department or its agent shall notify the parties of their right to request a review of the order for support. The department or its agent shall notify the parties by first class mail at their last known address or by including the notice in an order.

H. If a party in a title IV-D case requests a review and adjustment sooner than three years, the party shall demonstrate a changed circumstance that is substantial and continuing.

I. The right of a party entitled to receive support or the department to receive child support payments as provided in the court order vests as each installment falls due.  Each vested child support installment is enforceable as a final judgment by operation of law. The department or its agent or a party entitled to receive support may also file a request for written judgment for support arrearages.

J. Voluntary relinquishment of physical custody of a child to the obligor from the obligee is an affirmative defense in whole or in part to a petition for enforcement of child support arrears.  In determining whether the relinquishment was voluntary, the court shall consider whether there is any evidence or history of any of the following:

1. Domestic violence.

2. Parental kidnapping.

3. Custodial interference.

K. The relinquishment pursuant to subsection J of this section must have been for a time period in excess of any court-ordered period of parenting time and the obligor must have supplied actual support for the child.

L. If the obligee, the department or their agents make efforts to collect a child support debt more than ten years after the emancipation of the youngest child subject to the order, the obligor may assert as a defense, and has the burden to prove, that the obligee or the department unreasonably delayed in attempting to collect the child support debt.  On a finding of unreasonable delay a tribunal, as defined in section 25-1202, may determine that some or all of the child support debt is no longer collectible after the date of the finding.

M. Notwithstanding any other law, any judgment for support and for associated costs and attorney fees is exempt from renewal and is enforceable until paid in full.

N. If a party entitled to receive child support or spousal maintenance or the department or its agent enforcing an order of support has not received court-ordered payments, the party entitled to receive support or spousal maintenance or the department or its agent may file with the clerk of the superior court a request for judgment of arrearages and an affidavit indicating the name of the party obligated to pay support and the amount of the arrearages.  The request must include notice of the requirements of this section and the right to request a hearing within twenty days after service in this state or within thirty days after service outside this state. The request, affidavit and notice must be served pursuant to the Arizona rules of family law procedure on all parties including the department or its agents in title IV-D cases.  In a title IV-D case, the department or its agent may serve all parties by certified mail, return receipt requested. Within twenty days after service in this state or within thirty days after service outside this state, a party may file a request for a hearing if the arrearage amount or the identity of the person is in dispute.  If a hearing is not requested within the time provided, or if the court finds that the objection is unfounded, the court must review the affidavit and grant an appropriate judgment against the party obligated to pay support.

O. If after reasonable efforts to locate the obligee the clerk or support payment clearinghouse is unable to deliver payments for a period of one hundred twenty days after the date the first payment is returned as undeliverable due to the failure of a party to whom the support has been ordered to be paid to notify the clerk or support payment clearinghouse of a change in address, the clerk or support payment clearinghouse shall return that and all other unassigned payments to the obligor unless there is an agreement of the obligor to pay assigned arrears and other debts owed to the state.

P. If the obligee of a child support order marries the obligor of the child support order, that order automatically terminates on the last day of the month in which the marriage takes place and arrearages do not accrue after that date.  However, the obligee or the state may collect child support arrearages that accrued before that date.  The obligee, the obligor or the department or its agent in a title IV-D case may file a request or stipulation to terminate or adjust any existing order of assignment pursuant to section 25-504 or 25-505.01.

Q. For the purposes of this chapter, a child is emancipated:

1. On the date of the child's marriage.

2. On the child's eighteenth birthday.

3. When the child is adopted.

4. When the child dies.

5. On the termination of the support obligation if support is extended beyond the age of majority pursuant to section 25-501, subsection A or section 25-320, subsections E and F.

#### Section 25-503.01. Self-employed parent; monies held as security for payment of support

A. On a showing of good cause, the court may order that a self-employed parent who is required to make child support payments forward an amount equal to not more than six months of child support to the department to hold as security. The department shall release these monies to compensate an obligee for missed current child support payments.

B. This section does not apply unless the self-employed parent is in arrears for three months or more.

C. This section does not limit other remedies available to an obligee, the department or its agents.

D. If a self-employed parent who is required to forward monies to the department pursuant to this section demonstrates full and timely support payments for twenty-four consecutive months, the department shall release to that self-employed parent any monies that remain.

#### Section 25-504. Order of assignment; ex parte order of assignment; responsibilities; violation; termination

A. In a proceeding in which the court orders a person to pay support the court shall, and in a proceeding in which the court orders a person to pay spousal maintenance the court may, assign to the person or agency entitled to receive the support or spousal maintenance that portion of the person's income necessary to pay the amount ordered by the court. In a proceeding in which spousal maintenance is ordered to be paid the court shall order the assignment on either party's request.

B. A person who is obligated by an order to pay support or spousal maintenance, the person to whom support or spousal maintenance is ordered to be paid or the department or its agent in a title IV-D case may file a verified request with the clerk of the superior court requesting the clerk to issue an ex parte order of assignment for support or spousal maintenance.  The ex parte order of assignment may include a payment for current support and any other support, current spousal maintenance, spousal maintenance arrearages and interest on spousal maintenance arrearages.  A request filed by the department or its agent need not be verified.  The request shall state:

1. The name of the person or agency entitled to receive support or spousal maintenance.

2. The monthly amount of any current support and the monthly amount of any spousal maintenance ordered by the court.

3. The specific amount requested for any support arrearages, spousal maintenance arrearages or interest.

4. The name and address of the payor to whom it is requested the order of assignment be directed and the name of the person obligated to pay support or spousal maintenance.

C. After receipt of a request for an ex parte order of assignment the clerk of the superior court, without a hearing or notice to the person obligated to pay support or spousal maintenance, shall issue an order of assignment of that portion of the person's income as is sufficient to pay the amount requested to the person or agency entitled to receive the support or spousal maintenance. The order of assignment shall include the social security number of the obligated person.  On issuance of an ex parte order of assignment, the clerk shall issue a notice directed to the obligor in substantially the following form, which shall also be in Spanish:

Notice

To: The obligor (the person ordered to pay support or spousal maintenance)

This is to notify you that part of your income or other monies is being taken away by the enclosed order of assignment that was issued on a request for an order of assignment that also is enclosed. The order of assignment has been issued for currently accruing child support or spousal maintenance, or both, based on the requesting party's claim that you are obligated to pay this. In addition, the requesting party may be claiming a right to collect other support, as defined in section 25-500, Arizona Revised Statutes, arrearages on spousal maintenance or interest on a judgment for unpaid spousal maintenance.

If you believe the enclosed order of assignment is improper or unlawful, that your property is exempt by law or that your employer or other payor is withholding more than is permitted by law, you may request a hearing before the superior court.  You must file a request to terminate or adjust the order of assignment on forms provided by the clerk of the court within seven days after your receipt of the order for assignment, request for an order of assignment and this notice. If you request a hearing, it will be held no more than ten days after you file your request with the court.

Here are some other important things you should know:

The order of assignment is effective immediately on service of the order on your employer or another payor. The first employer or payor served shall not withhold or deduct amounts specified in the ex parte order of assignment for fourteen calendar days from the date of service to allow you, the obligor, an opportunity to contest the order of assignment as provided in section 25-504, Arizona Revised Statutes. A future employer or payor may begin deductions sooner than the fourteen day period after the order of assignment is received.

If you request a hearing, the court, after considering the financial resources of both parties and the reasonableness of the positions each party has taken, may order a party to pay a reasonable amount to the other for the attorney fees and costs of filing or defending the request.

Under state law (section 33-1131, Arizona Revised Statutes) no more than one-half of your disposable earnings for any pay period may be taken to satisfy an order issued for support or spousal maintenance. The amount of disposable earnings exempt from the order of assignment must be paid to you when due. Disposable income means the remaining portion of your wages, salary or compensation for personal services, including bonuses and commissions, or otherwise, and includes payments pursuant to a pension or retirement program or a deferred compensation plan, after deducting from such earnings the amounts required by law to be withheld.

An employer or other payor who receives the order of assignment may deduct from amounts due to you one dollar for each pay period, but not more than four dollars per month, for costs.  The employer or payor also must deduct a monthly amount for the support payment handling fee required by state law (section 25-510, Arizona Revised Statutes).

The employer or other payor on whom the order of assignment is served will continue to withhold the amount set in the order and will forward the payment to the support payment clearinghouse until you file with the clerk one of the following:

1. A verified request to adjust the order of assignment, and the court adjusts the order of assignment because there has been a change of circumstances since the time of the issuance of the order or there is other good cause to do so.

2. A verified request for a hearing to terminate the order of assignment and, after a hearing, the court terminates the order of assignment if all obligations have been satisfied or will be satisfied within ninety days.

3. A notarized stipulation stating that the obligation to pay support or spousal maintenance has ended and that all arrearages either have been satisfied or have been waived, and the clerk terminates the order of assignment.

An employer may not refuse to hire, may not discharge or may not otherwise discipline you as a result of the order of assignment. If you are wrongfully refused employment, discharged or otherwise disciplined you may recover damages suffered, plus reinstatement if appropriate, plus reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred against the employer.

Unless a court has expressly ordered otherwise, you must notify the clerk of the court or the support payment clearinghouse in writing of the address of your residence and of your employment and, within ten days, of a change in either one. Your failure to do so may subject you to sanctions for contempt of court, including reasonable attorney fees and costs pursuant to state law (section 25-504, subsection R, Arizona Revised Statutes). Official notices will be delivered to you at the most recent addresses you have provided to the clerk or support payment clearinghouse.

D. Any order of assignment shall be issued only for support, spousal maintenance, spousal maintenance arrearages, interest on spousal maintenance arrearages and handling fees. The order of assignment shall state the total amount that the payor shall withhold. The order of assignment also shall specify the monthly amount of current support and any other payment ordered for support, the monthly amount of any current spousal maintenance, the monthly amount of any spousal maintenance arrearages and any monthly interest payment.  If the obligor's disposable earnings from the primary employer or other payor do not meet the support obligation, the court shall issue an order of assignment to a secondary employer or other payor of the obligor in order to meet the full support obligation.

E. An order of assignment shall be served on any employer or other payor by first class mail, electronic transmission or personal delivery or pursuant to the Arizona rules of family law procedure. The order of assignment is effective immediately on receipt by any employer or other payor and any future employer or future payor. Any employer or other payor of monies shall begin withholding no later than fourteen days after receipt of an order of assignment.  The employer or other payor, if feasible, may begin withholding sooner than the fourteen day period if a payment to the obligor is due sooner.

F. Two copies of an ex parte order of assignment and of the request for an order of assignment, together with a copy of the notice required by this section, shall be served on any employer or other payor in the same manner as other orders of assignment under this section. Within five days after receipt, the employer or payor shall serve by personal delivery or by registered mail one copy of the ex parte order of assignment and of the request and the notice on the employee or other payee. The ex parte order of assignment is effective on any employer or other payor, and as an assignment by operation of law is effective on any future employers or other future payors, immediately on receipt. The first employer or other payor served shall not withhold or deduct amounts specified in the ex parte order of assignment for fourteen calendar days to allow the obligor an opportunity to contest the order of assignment as provided in this section. Any future employers or future payors shall begin withholding not later than fourteen days after receipt of an ex parte order of assignment but, if feasible, may begin withholding sooner than fourteen days if a payment to the obligor is due sooner.

G. After service of an ex parte order of assignment on the employer or payor that initially receives the order of assignment, an obligor may request a hearing to contest the ex parte order of assignment.  The request shall be made in writing, and the obligor shall state under oath the specific reason for the request. The request shall be filed with the court together with a notice of hearing form. The court shall hold a hearing within ten days after the request and notice of hearing form is filed. Immediately on the scheduling of the hearing, the obligor shall serve a copy of the request for and notice of hearing on the person entitled to receive support, and in a title IV-D case to the department. If the obligor files a request for hearing within seven days after receipt of the order of assignment, the court may order the support payment clearinghouse not to disburse any monies received pursuant to the order of assignment until further order of the court.  The obligor may contest the withholding for any of the following reasons:

1. There is an error in the identity of the obligor.

2. There is an error in the amount of support or spousal maintenance.

3. Invalidity of the order for support or spousal maintenance.

4. Current support or spousal maintenance is no longer owed, if the order of assignment includes a payment for current support or spousal maintenance.

5. Arrearages are not owed if the order of assignment includes a payment for arrearages.

H. Any employer or other payor who has received any order of assignment shall withhold the amount specified in the order of assignment, together with the handling fee as provided in section 25-510, from the income of the person obligated to pay support or spousal maintenance and shall transmit the withheld monies to the support payment clearinghouse within two business days after the obligor is paid or after the payment to the obligor is due.  The handling fee shall be deducted and transmitted monthly. For the cost of compliance the employer or payor may also withhold and retain an additional one dollar per payment but not more than four dollars per month for each obligor. An employer or payor may combine in a single payment withheld monies for more than one obligor, shall separately identify the portion of the remittance that is attributable to each obligor and shall include each obligor's social security number. An employer or payor shall notify the clerk or support payment clearinghouse in writing when the obligor is no longer employed or the right to receive income or other monies has been terminated. The employer or payor shall also notify the clerk or support payment clearinghouse in writing of the obligor's social security number and last known address and the name and address of the obligor's new employer, if known, within ten days.  In a non-title IV-D case, within ten days after receiving this information the support payment clearinghouse shall notify the clerk of the superior court in the county where the support or maintenance order was issued. If within ninety days of the last payment, the employer or other payor reemploys the obligor or becomes obligated to pay the obligor, the employer or payor is again bound by the order of assignment and is required to perform as required by this section. In a title IV-D case the order of assignment may be reinstated pursuant to section 25-505.01. An employer or payor who fails without good cause to comply with the terms of an order of assignment is liable for amounts not paid to the clerk or support payment clearinghouse pursuant to the order of assignment and reasonable attorney fees, costs and other expenses incurred in procuring compliance and may be subject to contempt.

I. If a person is obligated to pay child support for more than one family and the amount available for withholding is not sufficient to meet the total combined current child support obligation, any monies withheld from the obligor's income shall be allocated to each family by the employer or payor as follows:

1. The amount of current child support ordered in each case shall be added together to obtain the total current child support obligation.

2. The amount of current child support ordered in each case shall be divided by the total current child support obligation to obtain the percentage of the total current child support obligation to be allocated to each case.

3. The amount withheld from the obligor shall be multiplied by the percentage for each case to obtain the amount to be allocated to each case.

J. The person or agency entitled to receive support or spousal maintenance shall notify the clerk of the superior court or support payment clearinghouse in writing of any change of residential address and of any other information required pursuant to section 46-443, within ten days of any change.  If after reasonable efforts to locate the obligee the clerk or support payment clearinghouse is unable to deliver payments under an order of assignment for the period prescribed in section 25-503 due to the failure of an obligee to comply with the notice requirement of this subsection, the clerk or support payment clearinghouse shall not make further payment under the order of assignment and shall return payments to the obligor as prescribed in section 25-503. Under these circumstances the court, clerk or department or its agent shall order the release of the employer or payor from the order of assignment on request of the employer, the payor, the department or its agent or on the clerk's own initiative. Any order of assignment from which an employer or payor has been released may be reinstated by following the procedures for obtaining an ex parte order of assignment pursuant to this section or, in a title IV-D case, an administrative income withholding order pursuant to section 25-505.01.

K. Unless a court has ordered otherwise, the person ordered to pay support or spousal maintenance shall notify the clerk of the superior court or the support payment clearinghouse in writing of the obligor's residential address and the name and address of any employer, and within ten days of any change.  Failure to do so may subject the person to sanctions for contempt of court, including reasonable attorney fees and costs.

L. Any order of assignment may be adjusted if there has been a change of circumstances since the date the order of assignment was issued or for good cause. The department or its agent or a person obligated to pay or entitled to receive support or spousal maintenance shall file with the clerk of the superior court a request to adjust the order of assignment and a proposed order of assignment. The request shall specify the adjustment sought and the reason for the request. A copy of the request shall be served pursuant to the Arizona rules of family law procedure, or by the department or its agent in a title IV-D case by first class mail, on all other parties and on the state if the department is providing title IV-D support services or has a claim for arrearages. The party receiving the request and proposed order may request a hearing within twenty days or within thirty days if service is made outside this state. On proof of service and if a hearing has not been requested within the time allowed, the clerk shall issue the order of assignment as appropriate. Within two business days after the date the order of assignment is issued, the clerk shall transmit a copy of the order of assignment to the employer or payor, the department or its agent and all parties.  Unless ordered otherwise by the court, in a title IV-D case any order of assignment may be adjusted pursuant to section 25-505.01.

M. The department or its agent or a person obligated to pay or entitled to receive support or spousal maintenance may file a request to terminate any order of assignment if the obligation to pay support or spousal maintenance has ended or will end within ninety days after the filing of the request and if all arrearages either have been paid or will be paid within the period or have been waived. The request shall state the reason why termination is requested and shall contain the name and address of the employer or payor of the person obligated to pay support. A copy of the request shall be served pursuant to the Arizona rules of family law procedure, or by the department or its agent in a title IV-D case by first class mail, on all other parties and on the state if the department is providing title IV-D support services or has a claim for arrearages. A party receiving this notice may request a hearing within twenty days or within thirty days if service is made outside this state. On proof of service and if a hearing has not been requested within the time allowed, the clerk shall issue an order terminating the order of assignment as appropriate. Within two business days after the date the order is issued, the clerk shall transmit a copy of the order terminating the order of assignment to the employer or payor and to the department or its agent. If a hearing is requested, the court shall set the hearing within twenty days after receiving the request and shall issue an appropriate order. A person who is ordered to pay support may request the court to terminate an order of assignment at any time if an employer is making deductions on multiple assignments for an obligation for the same minor children. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the clerk shall not charge a fee to a person who files a request to terminate an order of assignment if an employer is making deductions on multiple assignments for an obligation for the same minor children.

N. If a request to adjust or terminate an order of assignment is filed, the court in its discretion may order that the clerk of the superior court or support payment clearinghouse not disburse any monies in dispute until further order of the court.

O. The clerk of the superior court shall issue an order terminating the order of assignment if the parties, including the department or its agent in a title IV-D case, file a notarized stipulation with the clerk that all obligations of support or spousal maintenance have been satisfied and that the obligor is no longer obligated to pay support or spousal maintenance.  The stipulation shall state that the current obligation of support or spousal maintenance no longer exists and that all arrearages either have been satisfied or waived. The stipulation shall also contain the name and address of the employer or payor of the person obligated to pay support or spousal maintenance. Within five business days after the date the stipulation is filed, the clerk shall transmit a copy of the order terminating the order of assignment to the employer or payor and to the department or its agent.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the clerk shall not charge a fee to a party who files a stipulation pursuant to this subsection.

P. An assignment ordered pursuant to this section has priority over all other executions, attachments or garnishments. An obligation for current child support shall be fully met before any payments pursuant to an order of assignment may be applied to any other support obligation.  An assignment ordered under this section does not apply to amounts made exempt under section 33-1131 or any other applicable exemption law.

Q. Any employer or other payor shall not refuse to hire a person and shall not discharge or otherwise discipline an obligor because of service of an order of assignment authorized by this section. An employer or payor who refuses to hire a person or who discharges or otherwise disciplines an employee or obligor because of service of an order of assignment is subject to contempt and sanctions as may be ordered by the court. A person who is wrongfully refused employment, wrongfully discharged or otherwise disciplined is entitled to recover damages sustained by the prohibited conduct, reinstatement, if appropriate, and attorney fees and costs incurred.

R. In any proceeding under this section the court, after considering the financial resources of the parties and the reasonableness of the positions each party has taken, may order a party to pay a reasonable amount to another party for the costs and expenses, including attorney fees, of maintaining or defending the proceeding.

 

#### Section 25-505. Limited income withholding orders; definition

A. The department or its agent may issue a limited income withholding order to any employer, payor or other holder of a nonperiodic or lump sum payment that is owed or held for the benefit of an obligor.  The department or its agent shall serve the order in the same manner as prescribed in section 25-505.01 for service of income withholding orders.  The employer, payor or holder shall deliver or mail by first class mail a copy of the order to the obligor within ten days after service on the employer, payor or holder.

B. The limited income withholding order shall state the amount of current support and any arrearages owed by an obligor and shall direct the employer, payor or holder to withhold and pay to the support payment clearinghouse the amount specified in the order and not otherwise exempt by law.

D. Notwithstanding sections 23-351 through 23-355, the employer, payor or holder who receives an income withholding order pursuant to section 25-505.01 or an order of assignment pursuant to section 25-504 shall withhold the amount specified and transmit that amount to the support payment clearinghouse immediately.

#### Section 25-505.01. Administrative income withholding order; notice; definition

A. In a title IV-D case, if a person is obligated to pay support, the department or its agent, without prior notice to the obligor, shall issue an income withholding order using the format prescribed by the United States secretary of health and human services.  The order shall include the obligor's social security number.  The withholding order shall include payment for current child support or spousal maintenance and may include an installment payment for arrearages pursuant to subsection B of this section or any other support.  A withholding order under this section does not apply to amounts exempt under section 33-1131, subsection C or any other applicable exemption law.  The withholding order shall direct the holder of the monies to withhold and pay to the person or agency entitled to receive the support the amount ordered by the department.  The withholding order shall be accompanied by a written notice of withholding as prescribed in this section.

B. In addition to current support an income withholding order may include an installment for arrearages or any other support if:

1. At the time of issuance, the arrearage is an amount equal to at least two months but not more than six months of the obligor's current support obligation, the income withholding order shall include an additional amount equal to twenty-five per cent of the current support obligation.

2. At the time of issuance, the arrearage is an amount equal to more than six months of the obligor's current support obligation, the income withholding order shall include an additional amount equal to thirty-three per cent of the current support obligation.

3. At the time of issuance, the arrearage is an amount equal to one year or more of the obligors's support obligation, an income withholding order may include an additional amount that exceeds thirty-three per cent of the support obligation.

C. If the obligor does not owe current support but arrearages remain unpaid, the department or its agent may issue or adjust an income withholding order only for arrearages.  The income withholding order shall be in the amount of the most recent current support order or the most recent order regarding the payment on arrearages, whichever is greater.

D. The department shall serve the order and notice on an employer or payor by first class mail or by electronic means. Service by mail as authorized in this section is complete as to the employer or payor when the mailing is received.  Service by electronic means is complete on transmission to the employer or payor.  The income withholding order shall direct the employer or payor to deliver or mail by first class mail a copy of the income withholding notice and order to the obligor within ten days after service on the employer or payor.

E. The income withholding order is an assignment and is binding fourteen days after receipt on an existing and future employer or payor of the person ordered to pay support or spousal maintenance on whom a copy of the income withholding order and notice of withholding is served. The employer or payor shall withhold the amount specified in the order from the income of the person obligated to pay support and shall transmit that amount to the support payment clearinghouse within two business days after the date the employee is paid. The employer or payor shall advise the support payment clearinghouse of the date the monies were withheld, may combine withheld amounts for several employees in a single payment and shall separately identify the portion of the payment that is attributable to each employee. The employer or other payor may also withhold and retain for application to the employer's or payor's cost of compliance an additional one dollar per pay period or four dollars per month.

F. If the obligor's disposable income from the primary employer or payor does not meet the support obligation, the department shall issue an income withholding order to a secondary employer of the obligor in order to meet the full support obligation.

G. Any obligor, employer or other payor may challenge the income withholding order issued by the department or its agent by filing a written request for administrative review with the department or its agent within ten days after receipt of the notice of income withholding order from the employer or payor.  The administrative review shall be conducted pursuant to section 25-522.  On receipt of a request for administrative review the department or its agent shall delay implementation of the income withholding order.

H. A change in income withholding pursuant to subsection B of this section is not a sufficient basis for a modification of the current support order.

I. Notwithstanding section 25-504, in a title IV-D case, if all obligations of support have been satisfied and the person obligated to pay support is no longer obligated and if the parties, including the department or its agent in a title IV-D case, submit a stipulation that the current obligation of support no longer exists and that all arrearages either have been satisfied or waived, the department or its agent shall issue an order terminating the income withholding order. The order shall state that the current obligation of support no longer exists and that all arrearages either have been satisfied or waived. The stipulation shall also contain the name and address of the employer or payor of the person obligated to pay support. Within five business days after the date the stipulation is submitted, the department or its agent shall send by first class mail a copy of the order terminating the income withholding order to the employer or payor, the parties and the clerk of the court.

J. Notwithstanding section 25-504, in a title IV-D case, the department or its agent on its own initiative, or the parties to a child support proceeding on request to the department, may terminate an income withholding order issued pursuant to this section or section 25-504, if the obligation to pay support has ended or will end within ninety days after the date the request is submitted and if all arrearages either have been paid or will be paid within the period or have been waived. The request shall include a statement of why the termination is requested, supporting documentation and the name and address of the employer and person obligated to pay support.  The requesting party shall notify each party by first class mail of the request to terminate the order.  The employer or payor shall continue to withhold and transmit support or spousal maintenance until otherwise ordered.  On receipt of a request to terminate an income withholding order the department or its agent may suspend disbursements until a determination is issued.  A party that receives notice of a request to terminate an income withholding order may object to the request and provide the department or its agent with the basis for the objection and supporting documents within ten days after receipt of the notice. Within forty-five days after the request the department or its agent shall issue a determination to all parties based on the information available. On a determination to terminate an income withholding order, the department or its agent within two business days shall send by first class mail a copy of the order terminating or adjusting the order to the employer or payor and to the support payment clearinghouse.

K. The employer or payor shall notify the support payment clearinghouse in writing when the person ordered to pay support or spousal maintenance is no longer employed by the employer or the right to receive income has been terminated. The employer shall notify the support payment clearinghouse in writing of the former employee's last known address and the name and address of the new employer, if known. If the employer or payor is again obligated to pay income to a person ordered to pay support within ninety days after termination of this right, the employer or payor is again bound by the income withholding order and is required to perform pursuant to this section.

L. The obligation for current child support shall be fully met before any payments under an order of assignment may be applied to payments of arrearages.  If a person is obligated to pay child support for more than one family and the amount available for withholding is not sufficient to meet the total combined child support obligation, any monies withheld from the obligor's income shall be allocated to each family by the employer or payor as follows:

1. The amount of current child support ordered in each case shall be added to obtain the total child support obligation.

2. The ordered amount in each case shall be divided by the total child support obligation to obtain a percentage of the total amount due.

3. The amount available from the obligor's income shall be multiplied by the percentage under paragraph 2 of this subsection to obtain the amount to be allocated to each family.

M. An income withholding order shall include a statement that an employer shall not refuse to hire a person or shall not discharge or otherwise discipline an employee as a result of an income withholding order authorized by this section, and an employer who refuses to hire a person or who discharges or otherwise disciplines an employee as a result of the income withholding order is subject to contempt and fines as established by the court.  Any person wrongfully refused employment or an employee wrongfully discharged or otherwise disciplined is entitled to recovery of damages suffered, reinstatement if appropriate, plus attorney fees and costs incurred.  Any employer or other payor who fails without good cause to comply with the terms of the income withholding order may be liable for amounts not paid to the support payment clearinghouse pursuant to the income withholding order, reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred and may be subject to contempt.  The department may initiate an action in superior court to enforce this subsection.

N. On issuance of an income withholding order the department or its agent shall issue a notice of withholding directed to the person ordered to pay support. The notice shall advise the obligor that:

1. An income withholding order has been issued against the obligor's income for payment of currently accruing child support or spousal maintenance, or both.

2. The income withholding order may include an amount for child support arrearages, or any other support.

3. The obligor may file a written request for administrative review with the department pursuant to section 25-522 within ten days after receipt of this notice if the obligor believes that:

(a) The income withholding order is improper or unlawful.

(b) The obligor's property is exempt by law.

(c) The employer or other payor is withholding more than permitted by law.

4. An income withholding order made pursuant to this section becomes binding on the employer or payor or any future employers or future payors fourteen days after receipt of a copy of the order and notice of withholding.

5. The employer or payor shall withhold the amount specified in the order from the income of the person obligated to pay support.

6. Not more than one-half of the obligor's disposable income for any period may be taken to satisfy an income withholding order issued for the support of any person.

7. The amount of disposable income exempt from the income withholding order must be paid to the obligor on the regular payday for the pay period in which income is earned.

8. The employer or other payor shall continue to withhold the amount set forth in the order each pay period and shall forward the amount to the child support payment clearinghouse until either:

(a) The obligor files a request for administrative review with the department or its agent and after review the department or its agent modifies or terminates the income withholding order.

(b) The obligor files a petition with the court and, after a hearing, the court modifies or terminates the income withholding order.

9. An employer may not refuse to hire, may not discharge or may not otherwise discipline the obligor as a result of this income withholding order. If the obligor is wrongfully refused employment, discharged or otherwise disciplined, the obligor may recover damages suffered, reinstatement of employment if appropriate and reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred against the employer.

10. Unless ordered otherwise, the obligor has a duty to notify the support payment clearinghouse in writing of the address of the obligor's residence and employment and, within ten days, of a change in either one. The department or its agent shall use these addresses to notify the obligor of all subsequent actions to enforce support. Failure of the obligor to advise the department of changes in residential or employment address may subject the obligor to sanctions for contempt of court, including reasonable attorney fees and costs.

O. An income withholding order issued pursuant to this section has the same force and effect as an order of the superior court, has priority over all other attachments, executions, garnishments or assignments and may be enforced against the obligor and employer in superior court.

P. For purposes of this section, "arrearages" means past due support, including interest.

 

#### Section 25-505.02. Insurance data exchange; withholding orders; immunity; definitions

A. Before remitting a payment under an insurance contract to a claimant whose claim is based on an accident or a loss that occurred in this state, an insurer authorized to transact insurance pursuant to title 20, chapter 2, article 1 may provide information to the department or its agent to ascertain whether a claimant owes any arrearage. An insurer may establish and revise at its discretion the dollar-amount threshold for claims at or above which it will report pursuant to this section.

B. The department or its agent shall establish an insurance industry data match reporting system that is operated by the department or its agent and use data exchanges to compare claimant information held by insurers with the department's database of obligors who owe arrearages. An insurer may either provide to the department or its agent information about the claimant or match information made available by the department or its agent with information about the claimant.

C. If a claimant who owes an arrearage is identified, an insurer may provide the following information on claims to the department or its agent before making a payment to the claimant:

1. The claimant's name, address, date of birth and social security number, if available, as they appear in the insurer's records.

2. The insurer's name, address and federal employer identification number.

3. The name and contact information for the insurer's employee that is managing the claimant's claim.

D. If the insurer is unable to use a method and format prescribed by the department or its agent, the insurer may cooperate with the department or its agent to identify another method including submission of written materials.

E. An insurer may provide information under this section by either of the following:

1. Participating in an insurance industry database that contains the necessary information and authorizes the department or its agent to obtain the information from the database for purposes of complying with this section.

2. Providing the information through the federal office of child support enforcement.

F. The department or its agent may use the information collected pursuant to this section for the administration and enforcement of child support pursuant to title IV-D. Except as provided by federal law, the information collected shall be used only to locate a person to establish paternity and to establish, modify and enforce support obligations.  The information may be disclosed to an agent under contract with the department to carry out these purposes.  The information may also be disclosed to agencies of this state, political subdivisions of this state, federal agencies involved with support, other states and political subdivisions of other states that are seeking to locate persons to enforce support pursuant to title IV-D.  The information collected pursuant to this section is exempt from disclosure pursuant to title 39, chapter 1.

G. If a comparison of claimant and obligor information reveals a match with an obligor who has child support arrearage in a title IV-D case, the department or its agent shall send to the insurer, within three business days after discovering the match, an income withholding order pursuant to section 25-505.01 or a child support limited income withholding order pursuant to section 25-505. Any portion that replaces wages or provides income in lieu of wages is subject to the limitations prescribed in section 33-1131, subsection C. The insurer shall withhold the full amount of the arrearages as set forth in the child support limited income withholding order that is not otherwise exempt by law and pay the withheld amount to the support payment clearinghouse.

H. An insurer that makes a payment as permitted by this section arising from a child support limited income withholding order as permitted in this section is not liable to the claimant or the claimant's beneficiary or creditors.

I. A child support limited income withholding order issued pursuant to this section encumbers the right of a claimant to payment under the policy. The insurer shall disburse to the claimant only the portion of the payment remaining, if any, after the child support limited income withholding order has been satisfied.

J. The child support limited income withholding order is inferior to any lien or claim for both of the following:

1. Documented services and expenses that are related to the claim, including attorney fees, court costs, witness fees and reasonable litigation expenses.

2. Health care expenses.

K. Notwithstanding any other law, an insurer is immune from any liability for using the data match reporting system to identify if a claimant owes an arrearage, for providing information to the department or its agent pursuant to this section or for a delay in the payment of a claim resulting from compliance with this section.

L. An insurer that makes a payment on a child support lien as permitted in this section is not liable to the claimant or the claimant's beneficiary or creditors. An insurer that in good faith fails to make a payment on a child support lien as provided in this section is immune from civil liability. This section does not give rise to a claim or cause of action against an insurer by a person who asserts that the person is the intended obligee of the outstanding lien for child support.

M. An insurer is not required to report or identify the following types of claims:

1. First-party actual property damage claims that are benefits payable under an insurance policy arising out of covered damage for actual repair, replacement or loss of use of an insured property, including a payment for:

#### Section 25-506. Order for assignment; foreign support order

A. A petition for an ex parte order for assignment may be filed by an agency based on an order for support issued by a court or an agency in a state other than this state. The petition shall include the information required by section 25-504 and the following documents:

1. A certified copy of the support order with all modifications.

2. A certified copy of an income withholding order, if any, still in effect.

3. A copy of the income withholding law of the jurisdiction that issued the support order.

4. A sworn statement of arrearages.

5. The assignment of support rights, if any.

B. On receipt of a petition pursuant to subsection A of this section, the clerk of the court shall enter an order for ex parte assignment. The order for wage assignment is binding on any employer or payor who is doing business in this state and who employs or is obligated to make periodic payments to the person owing child support or spousal maintenance and is subject to this section. Participation in a proceeding under this subsection does not confer jurisdiction on a court over any of the parties to the proceeding in any other proceeding. If an obligor does not have periodic earnings, income or entitlements, the court shall order an assignment against any monies owed to the obligor or held for the benefit of the obligor. The order of assignment shall direct the holder of the monies to withhold and pay to the person or agency entitled to receive the child support the amount necessary to pay the amount ordered by the court.

C. If the obligor seeks to quash the assignment, the attorney general or county attorney shall immediately notify the petitioning state of the date, time and place of the hearing and of the obligee's right to attend. The only bases for the obligor to contest the withholding are that:

1. The withholding is not proper because of a mistake of fact that is not res judicata.

2. The court or agency that issued the support order lacked personal jurisdiction over the obligor.

3. The order was obtained by fraud.

4. The statute of limitations precludes enforcement of all or a part of the arrearages.

D. The court, on request of any party, shall continue the hearing on the motion to quash to permit evidence relative to the defense to be adduced by either party.

E. On a motion to quash, the court, for good cause, may quash the portion of an assignment order relating to arrearages without prejudice to the petitioner.

F. The obligation for current child support shall be fully met before any payments under an order of assignment may be applied to the payment of arrearages. If a person is obligated to pay child support for more than one family and the amount available for withholding is not sufficient to meet the total combined child support obligation, any monies withheld from the obligor's earnings, income, entitlements or other monies shall be allocated to each family by the employer or payor as follows:

1. The amount of current child support ordered in each case shall be added to obtain the total child support obligation.

2. The ordered amount in each case shall be divided by the total child support obligation to obtain a percentage of the total amount due.

3. The amount withheld from the obligor's earnings, income, entitlements or other monies shall be multiplied by the percentage under paragraph 2 of this subsection to obtain the amount to be allocated to each family.

#### Section 25-507. Forms; alternative forms

A. The request for assignment, order of assignment, notices to obligor and employer, request for hearing and request to adjust or terminate the order of assignment shall be on forms prescribed by the supreme court and shall be furnished by the clerk of the superior court as required by law or on request of any obligor, payee or employer.

B. Any party may use documents other than those provided pursuant to this section if the documents are substantially similar to those prescribed by the supreme court pursuant to this section.

#### Section 25-508. Enforcement of support orders; fee prohibition

A. Any judgment, order or decree, whether arising from a dissolution, divorce, separation, annulment, custody determination, paternity or maternity determination or dependency proceeding or from a uniform interstate enforcement of support act proceeding and any interlocutory support award in any such proceeding or in any other proceeding regarding support that provides for alimony, spousal maintenance or child support may be enforced as a matter of right by lien, execution, attachment, garnishment, levy, appointment of a receiver, provisional remedies or any other form of relief provided by law as an enforcement remedy for civil judgments. An affidavit regarding all payments in default under the support order, along with a copy of the underlying support order, shall be filed with the clerk of the superior court along with the appropriate writ, application, petition or motion.

B. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a department of this state or its political subdivisions shall not charge the department or its agents a fee for performing an act necessary to enforce a support order as provided by this section.

#### Section 25-509. Representation by attorney general or county attorney; modification of order by attorney general or county attorney

A. The attorney general or county attorney on behalf of this state may initiate an action or intervene in an action to establish, modify or enforce a duty of child support, including medical support, regardless of the welfare or nonwelfare status of the person to whom the duty of support is owed. The attorney general or county attorney may establish, modify or enforce such a duty of support by all means available, including all civil and criminal remedies provided by law. An attorney-client relationship does not exist between the attorney and an applicant or recipient of child support enforcement services.

B. This state may initiate an action or may intervene in an action involving child support. Intervention by the state in an existing action is by unconditional right and is accomplished by the state filing an entry of appearance.

C. The attorney general or county attorney shall not seek or defend any ancillary matters, such as custody or parenting time, raised in these proceedings. The attorney general or county attorney may petition for modification of child support or medical support for children.

#### Section 25-510. Receiving and disbursing support and maintenance monies; arrearages; interest

A. The support payment clearinghouse established pursuant to section 46-441 shall receive and disburse all monies, including fees and costs, applicable to support and maintenance unless the court has ordered that support or maintenance be paid directly to the party entitled to receive the support or maintenance. Within two business days the clerk of the superior court shall transmit to the support payment clearinghouse any maintenance and support payments received by the clerk. Monies received by the support payment clearinghouse in cases not enforced by the state pursuant to title IV-D of the social security act shall be distributed in the following priority:

1. Current child support or current court ordered payments for the support of a family when combined with the child support obligation.

2. Current spousal maintenance.

3. The current monthly fee prescribed in subsection D of this section for handling support or spousal maintenance payments.

4. Past due support reduced to judgment and then to associated interest.

5. Past due spousal maintenance reduced to judgment and then to associated interest.

6. Past due support not reduced to judgment and then to associated interest.

7. Past due spousal maintenance not reduced to judgment and then to associated interest.

8. Past due amounts of the fee prescribed in subsection D of this section for handling support or spousal maintenance payments.

B. In any proceeding under this chapter regarding a duty of support, the records of payments maintained by the clerk or the support payment clearinghouse are prima facie evidence of all payments made and disbursed to the person or agency to whom the support payment is to be made and are rebuttable only by a specific evidentiary showing to the contrary.

C. At no cost to the clerk of the superior court, the department shall provide electronic access to all records of payments maintained by the support payment clearinghouse, and the clerk shall use this information to provide payment histories to all litigants, attorneys and interested persons and the court. For all non-title IV-D support cases, the clerk shall load new orders, modify order amounts, respond to payment inquiries, research payment related issues, release payments pursuant to orders of the court and update demographic and new employer information. The clerk shall forward orders of assignment to employers for non-title IV-D support orders. Within five business days the clerk shall provide to the department any new address, order of assignment or employment information the clerk receives regarding any support order. The information shall be provided as prescribed by the department of economic security in consultation with the administrative office of the courts.

D. The support payment clearinghouse shall receive a monthly fee for handling support and maintenance payments. The director, by rule, may establish this fee.  The court shall order payment of the handling fee as part of the order for support or maintenance.  The handling fee shall not be deducted from the support or maintenance portion of the payment.

E. In calculating support arrearages not reduced to a final written money judgment, interest accrues at the rate of ten per cent per annum beginning at the end of the month following the month in which the support payment is due, and interest accrues only on the principal and not on interest. A support arrearage reduced to a final written money judgment accrues interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum and accrues interest only on the principal and not on interest.

F. Past support reduced to a final written money judgment before September 26, 2008 and pursuant to section 25-320, subsection C or section 25-809, subsection B accrues interest at the rate of ten per cent per annum beginning on entry of the judgment by the court and accrues interest only on the principal and not on interest.  Past support reduced to a final written money judgment beginning on September 26, 2008 and pursuant to section 25-320, subsection C or section 25-809, subsection B does not accrue interest for any time period.

G. Any direct payments not paid through the clearinghouse or any equitable credits of principal or interest permitted by law and allowed by the court after a hearing shall be applied to support arrearages as directed in the court order.  The court shall make specific findings in support of any payments or credits allowed.  If the court order does not expressly state the dates the payments or credits are to be applied, the payments or credits shall be applied on the date of the entry of the order that allows the payments or credits. In a title IV-D case, if a court order does not indicate on its face that the state was either represented at or had notice of the hearing or proceeding where the payments or credits were determined, the court order shall not reduce any sum owed to the department or its agent without written approval of the department or its agent.

H. Any credit against support arrearages, other than by court order, shall be made only by written affidavit of direct payment or waiver of support arrearages signed by the person entitled to receive the support or by that person and the person ordered to make the support payment. The affidavit of direct payment or waiver of support arrearages shall be filed directly with the clerk of the court, who shall enter the information into the statewide case registry.  Any credits against support arrearages shall be applied as of the dates contained in the affidavit or the date of the affidavit if no other date is specified in the affidavit.  In a title IV-D case, the affidavit of direct payment or waiver of support arrearages shall not reduce any sum owed to the department or its agent without written approval of the department or its agent.

I. An arrearage calculator may be developed by a government agency using an automated transfer of data from the clearinghouse and the child support registry. The arrearage figure produced by this calculator is presumed to be the correct amount of the arrearage.

 

#### Section 25-511. Failure of parent to provide for child; classification

A. Except as provided in section 25-501, subsection F, any parent of a minor child who knowingly fails to furnish reasonable support for the parent's child is guilty of a class 6 felony.

B. It is an affirmative defense to a charge of a violation of subsection A of this section that the defendant has complied with a valid court order that was in effect for the time period charged and that set forth an amount of support for the minor child or was unable to furnish reasonable support. Inability to furnish reasonable support is not a defense if the defendant voluntarily remained idle, voluntarily decreased his income or voluntarily incurred other financial obligations.

C. The trier of fact, in determining whether the defendant has failed to furnish reasonable support, shall consider all assets, earnings and entitlements of the defendant and whether the defendant has made all reasonable efforts to obtain the necessary funds. On a showing of previous employment or lack of a physical or mental disability precluding employment, the trier of fact may infer that the defendant is capable of full-time employment at least at the federal adult minimum wage. This inference does not apply to noncustodial parents who are under the age of eighteen and who are still attending high school.

#### Section 25-511.01. Spousal maintenance order; violation; classification

A person who is obligated to pay spousal maintenance pursuant to an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor if the person has notice of the order and wilfully and without lawful excuse fails to comply with the terms of that order.

#### Section 25-512. Consumer credit reports; use of child support or spousal maintenance obligation information

A. A consumer reporting agency as defined in title 44, chapter 11, article 6 shall include as part of a consumer report information regarding:

1. A court order or judgment obligating a person to pay child support or spousal maintenance.

2. A court order for assignment under section 25-323 or 25-504.

3. An income withholding order issued by the department of economic security or its agent pursuant to section 25-505.01.

B. The state or a person entitled to receive support or spousal maintenance may provide a consumer reporting agency with a copy of a court order or judgment described in this section.

C. The department or its agent may provide a consumer reporting agency with electronic or documentary information that an order or judgment for support or spousal maintenance exists.

D. The department shall report to a consumer reporting agency the name of an obligor who is delinquent in the payment of support and the amount of the support owed.

E. The department shall provide written notice to an obligor that it shall report the amount of the support owed by the obligor to a consumer reporting agency. The department shall provide this notice by first class mail at the obligor's current address, or after a reasonable attempt to ascertain the obligor's location, at the obligor's last known address. The notice shall state the following:

1. The obligor's name and the amount of the arrearage.

2. The address and telephone number of the department or its agent.

3. That the obligor may make a written request to the department or its agent for an administrative review pursuant to section 25-522 to contest the arrearages within fifteen days after the date of mailing of the notice.

4. That if the obligor requests an administrative review the department shall not release the report to the consumer reporting agency until a final determination has been made at the administrative review.

5. That if an obligor requests an administrative review, the issues at the administrative review shall be limited to whether the obligor is required to pay child support, whether the obligor is in arrears and the amount of current support and arrears.

6. That if the obligor does not respond to the notice, the department shall send the report to the consumer reporting agency.

#### Section 25-513. Employer cooperation; violation; classification

A. On written request delivered to an employer, payor or self-employed person by the department or its agent or the child support enforcement entity of any other state or its agent that administers a child support enforcement program as required by title IV-D of the social security act or by either party to a proceeding for support or maintenance, the employer, payor or self-employed person to whom the request is directed within twenty days of delivery shall notify the requesting party of the following information that the employer, payor or self-employed person possesses concerning the person who is obligated to pay support or maintenance or against whom this obligation is sought or to whom this obligation is owed:

1. Complete name.

2. Social security number.

3. Date and place of birth.

4. Present and past employment status.

5. Earnings, income, entitlements or other monies without regard to source.

C. If any legal action is necessary for the requesting party to obtain the information requested pursuant to subsection A, the requesting party is entitled to receive costs and attorney fees from the employer, payor or self-employed person who fails to cooperate as prescribed in subsection A.

D. A party shall not request or receive address information protected by an order of protection, an injunction against harassment or any other court order in a domestic violence matter. The employer, payor or self-employed person is not required to determine whether an order of protection, an injunction against harassment or any other court order in a domestic violence matter exists before releasing the information requested pursuant to subsection A.

E. A party other than the department or its agent or the child support enforcement entity of any other state or its agent that administers a child support enforcement program as required by title IV-D of the social security act may make a request for information pursuant to this section not more than once in any three month period.

F. The department or its agent or the child support enforcement entity of any other state or its agent that administers a child support enforcement program as required by title IV-D of the social security act may deliver the request allowed in subsection A electronically.

2. To identify and locate a person against whom an obligation is sought.

4. To identify and locate information pursuant to subsection A, paragraphs 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 relating to a person who is obligated to pay support.

H. A party who requests or obtains information pursuant to subsection A for purposes other than those prescribed in subsection G is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.

 

#### Section 25-514. Priority of action and judgments

Except as otherwise provided by statute, actions pursuant to this article shall be given priority over all other civil actions. Except for judgments foreclosing or enforcing prior recorded mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts or conveyance of real property, security agreements, or other liens or encumbrances upon real or personal property created by the property owner a judgment resulting from an action brought for enforcement of child support has priority over all other judgments. Such priority shall not arise until a certified copy of the child support judgment is recorded with the county recorder.

#### Section 25-516. Lien; priority; recording; information statement; payoff amount; release

A. Notwithstanding section 25-514, in a title IV-D case an order to pay child support creates a lien by operation of law on all property presently owned and later acquired by the obligor to secure payment of the obligation. The department may perfect a lien by filing a copy of the child support order with the county recorder in the county in which the obligor has property or with a state agency or a political subdivision of this state that files personal property liens for recording on its official record. A liquidated judgment is not required to establish a lien. Recordation is constructive notice of the lien to the creditors of the owner or subsequent purchasers, against the personal or real property presently owned or later acquired.  The lien amount includes the amount owed at the time of recording and any amounts subsequently accrued. The lien has priority over other liens against this property except for liens arising from mortgages, deeds of trust, contracts, conveyances or security agreements created by the property owner and previously recorded or filed.

B. When recorded, the order shall be accompanied by the information statement of the judgment creditor pursuant to section 33-967. The statement shall set forth the amount of the current support order at the time of recording.  A copy of the information statement of the judgment creditor and the order recorded shall be mailed to the obligor at the obligor's last known address.

C. On request, the department shall provide a payoff amount to the obligor or a party acting with the obligor's consent.  If the obligor disagrees with the payoff amount, the obligor may make a written request for administrative review to contest the arrears pursuant to section 25-522. The issues to be determined are whether the obligor is required to pay support and is in arrears and the amount of arrears owed.

D. The department, at any time, may release the property subject to the lien from the lien. Notice by the department to the effect that the property has been released from the lien is conclusive evidence that the property had been released. When the department closes a title IV-D case, the department shall release any lien under this section.  The lien release does not satisfy any amount of unpaid support or release the lien associated with a recorded judgment. The department shall record the lien release in any county, agency or political subdivision where the original lien was recorded.

#### Section 25-517. License suspension; notice; administrative review or hearing

A. The department or its agent shall notify an obligor who is at least six months in arrears in making child support payments, periodic payments on a support arrearage or periodic payments pursuant to a court order of support that the obligor may be referred to court for a hearing to suspend or deny the obligor's driver license or recreational license.  The department or its agent shall notify the obligor by first class mail at the obligor's current address or, after a reasonable attempt to ascertain the obligor's location, at the obligor's last known address.  The notice shall state the following:

1. The obligor has failed to pay child support, continues to do so and is at least six months in arrears in making child support payments.

2. The obligor may request in writing an administrative review conducted pursuant to section 25-522 to contest the matter within fifteen days from the date of mailing of the notice.

3. If the obligor requests an administrative review, the department or its agent shall stay the action to refer the obligor to court for the suspension or denial of the obligor's recreational or driver license.

4. If the obligor fails to respond to the notice, the department or its agent shall refer the obligor to court for license suspension or denial pursuant to section 25-518.

5. The address and telephone number of the department.

6. The obligor may request a copy of the child support order.

B. The obligor has the burden of showing that the failure to make support payments was not wilful.

C. If an obligor requests an administrative review pursuant to this section, the issues at the review are limited to whether the obligor is required to pay child support and has wilfully failed to pay.  The department or its agent shall not refer the obligor to court unless the department or its agent determines that the obligor is at least six months in arrears and has wilfully failed to pay.  The department or its agent shall make this decision in writing and shall provide a copy to the obligor.

D. If the department or its agent determines that the obligor is at least six months in arrears and has wilfully failed to pay, the department shall refer the obligor to court for license suspension pursuant to section 25-518.

E. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, if an obligor is at least six months in arrears in making child support payments, periodic payments on a support arrearage or periodic payments pursuant to a court order of support, the title IV-D agency or its agent may issue a notice to the obligor that the obligor's professional or occupational license may be suspended.  The title IV-D agency or its agent shall notify the obligor by first class mail at the obligor's current address, or after a reasonable attempt to ascertain the obligor's location, at the obligor's last known address.  The notice shall state that the obligor has failed to pay child support, continues to do so and is at least six months in arrears in making child support payments.  The notice shall also state that within fifteen days after the notice is mailed the obligor may make a written request for an administrative review pursuant to section 25-522 to contest the matter.

F. If the obligor does not respond to the notice prescribed in subsection E of this section, the title IV-D agency or its agent shall issue an administrative order of noncompliance to the board or agency to order the suspension of the obligor's professional or occupational license.  If the obligor requests an administrative review, the title IV-D agency or its agent shall stay further action until a determination has been made at the administrative review. The issues at the review are limited to whether the obligor is required to pay child support and has wilfully failed to pay. The department or its agent shall make this decision in writing and shall provide a copy to the obligor. If the obligor disagrees with the final determination, the obligor has a right to a hearing before the suspension of the obligor's professional or occupational license.  The title IV-D agency or its agent must receive a request for a hearing on the determination of noncompliance within fourteen days after the date of the determination.

G. The title IV-D agency or its agent shall notify the office of administrative hearings of a request for a hearing pursuant to subsection F of this section within five business days after receipt of the request. The office of administrative hearings shall hold a hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  The obligor has the burden of showing that the failure to make support payments was not wilful.  The issues at the hearing are limited to whether the obligor is required to pay child support and has wilfully failed to pay. If the administrative law judge upholds the department's determination, the title IV-D agency or its agent shall issue an administrative order of noncompliance to the board or agency ordering it to suspend the obligor's professional or occupational license.

 

#### Section 25-518. Child support arrearage; license suspension; hearing

A. If a court finds from the evidence presented at a hearing to enforce a child support order that the obligor has wilfully failed to pay child support, continues after notice pursuant to section 25-517, subsection A to wilfully fail to pay child support and is at least six months in arrears, the court shall do either of the following:

1. Send a certificate of noncompliance to the board or agency ordering the suspension or denial of a driver license or recreational license.

The warrant shall command that the named person be arrested and either remanded to the custody of the sheriff or brought before the judicial officer or, if the judicial officer is absent or unable to act, the nearest or most accessible judicial officer of the superior court in the same county. A warrant that is issued pursuant to this section remains in effect until it is executed or extinguished by the court.

C. The court shall determine and the warrant shall state the amount the arrested person shall pay in order to be released from custody.

D. For the purposes of this article, "child support arrest warrant" means an order that is issued by a judicial officer in a noncriminal child support matter and that directs a peace officer in this state to arrest the person named in the warrant and bring the person before the court.

 

#### Section 25-682. Time and manner of execution; information

A. A child support arrest warrant is executed by the arrest of the person named in the warrant. The warrant may be executed at any time.

B. When making an arrest pursuant to a child support arrest warrant, the arresting officer shall inform the person named in the warrant that the arresting officer has a child support arrest warrant unless:

1. The named person flees or forcibly resists before the arresting officer has an opportunity to inform the named person.

2. Providing this information will imperil the arrest.

C. In order to execute a child support arrest warrant, the arresting officer may use reasonable force to enter any building in which the person named in the warrant is or is reasonably believed to be.

D. The arresting officer does not have to possess the warrant at the time of the arrest. If after the arrest the arrested person requests to see the warrant, the arresting officer shall show the arrested person a copy of the warrant as soon as practicable.

E. The arrested person shall be brought before the issuing judicial officer as soon as possible or, if that judicial officer is absent or unable to act, the nearest or most accessible judicial officer of the superior court in the same county. In any event, the arrested person shall be brought before a judicial officer of the superior court in the issuing county or the county of arrest within twenty-four judicial business hours of the execution of the warrant. If the person is arrested in a county other than the county in which the warrant was issued, the arresting officer shall notify the sheriff and the local title IV-D agency, if applicable, in the county in which the warrant was issued that the person has been arrested. As soon as practicable, the sheriff of the county in which the warrant was issued shall take custody of and transport the arrested person to the issuing judicial officer or a judicial officer of the superior court in the county in which the warrant was issued. If the arrested person is not taken into custody and transported within seventy-two hours after arrest, the arrested person shall be released and issued a written notice directing the arrested person to appear at a specified date and time in the superior court in the county in which the warrant was issued. The notice shall have the same force and effect as an order of the superior court. The notice shall state that if the arrested person fails to appear as directed a child support arrest warrant may be issued. A copy of this notice shall be sent to the court and the local title IV-D agency, if applicable, in the county in which the warrant was issued.

#### Section 25-683. Procedure after arrest; payment for release from custody

A. When a person who is arrested pursuant to a child support arrest warrant is brought before the court, the judicial officer shall advise the arrested person of the nature of the proceedings and shall set a date for the next court appearance. The arrested person may be released from custody pending the hearing if the arrested person pays the amount set by the court pursuant to section 25-681 or a larger amount as the court determines. The court shall not reduce the amount ordered to be paid. The arrested person shall not be released from custody without paying the amount unless the court finds in writing or on the record that a compelling reason exists to release the arrested person. Monies received pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited and credited pursuant to section 25-502, subsection I.

B. If the arrested person pays the full amount set forth in the warrant before the arrested person is brought before a judicial officer, the arrested person may be released after receiving a notice to appear in the superior court in the county in which the warrant was issued pursuant to the procedure prescribed in section 25-682, subsection E. If the arrested person fails to appear as directed, a child support arrest warrant may be issued.

C. The arresting agency shall forward all amounts that are paid by the arrested person for release pursuant to this subsection to the clerk of the superior court in the county in which the warrant was issued or the support payment clearinghouse for deposit and credit pursuant to section 25-502, subsection I.

#### Section 25-684. Preexisting warrants

A civil arrest warrant that is issued before the effective date of this section for the failure to appear in a child support enforcement proceeding under this chapter or chapter 3 of this title automatically becomes a child support arrest warrant after the effective date of this section. This article applies to all procedures under the warrant, unless the agency that is responsible for child support enforcement in a county elects not to convert warrants issued in that county.

#### Section 25-685. Entry into criminal information system

Child support arrest warrants shall be entered in the wanted person file of the Arizona criminal justice information system.

## Chapter 6 - MATERNITY AND PATERNITY PROCEEDINGS

### Article 1 - Maternity and Paternity Proceedings

#### Section 25-801. Jurisdiction

The superior court has original jurisdiction in proceedings to establish maternity or paternity. All such proceedings shall be civil actions.

#### Section 25-802. Venue

Proceedings to establish maternity or paternity may be originated in the county of residence of the respondent or the petitioner or the child or children the subject of the action.  The fact that the petitioner parent or child or both are not, or never have been, residents of Arizona does not bar the proceeding.

 

#### Section 25-803. Persons who may originate proceedings; legal decision-making; parenting time; conciliation court

A. Proceedings to establish the maternity or paternity of a child or children and to compel support under this article may be commenced by any of the following:

1. The mother.

2. The father.

3. The guardian, conservator or best friend of a child or children born out of wedlock.

4. A public welfare official or agency of the county where the child or children reside or may be found.

5. The state pursuant to section 25-509.

B. An adult may bring an action to establish the adult's biological parent.

C. Any party to a proceeding under this article other than the state may request that legal decision-making and specific parenting time be determined as a part of the proceeding. When paternity is established the court may award legal decision-making and parenting time as provided in section 25-408. The attorney general or county attorney shall not seek or defend any ancillary matters such as legal decision-making or parenting time.

D. In any case in which paternity is established the parent with whom the child has resided for the greater part of the last six months shall have legal decision-making unless otherwise ordered by the court.

E. The services of the conciliation court may be used in regard to disputed matters of legal decision-making and parenting time.

 

#### Section 25-804. Time for instituting proceedings

Proceedings to establish the paternity of the child may be instituted during the pregnancy of the mother or after the birth of the child. The court shall dismiss any proceeding that is barred pursuant to section 8-106, subsection J. For the purposes of establishing a duty to pay support or past support, the proceedings must be instituted before the child's eighteenth birthday.

 

#### Section 25-805. Effect of death, absence or insanity of plaintiff

If after the petition is filed the petitioner dies, becomes insane, departs the state or fails to litigate the issue, the proceedings do not abate but may be continued, with the state as petitioner, as to any child in the legal custody of any state agency, or as to any child who is the beneficiary of any state or federal financial assistance.

 

#### Section 25-806. Petition

A. Paternity proceedings are commenced by the filing of a verified petition that alleges that a woman is delivered of a child or children born out of lawful wedlock or pregnant with a child conceived out of wedlock and that the respondent is the father of the child or children.

B. Maternity proceedings are commenced by the filing of a verified petition that alleges that a woman is delivered of a child or children born out of lawful wedlock and that the woman as respondent is the mother of the child or children.

C. The procedure on the filing of the petition shall be as in other civil cases, except that a party who has been served pursuant to section 8-106, subsection G must serve the mother with a copy of the verified petition and summons within thirty days after completion of service of notice as prescribed by that subsection.

D. If the respondent does not file a response or if the respondent files a written response admitting paternity or maternity, the court may immediately enter a judgment of paternity or maternity.  If other relevant issues are raised in the petition or response or in a separate petition filed after entry of a paternity or maternity judgment, the court shall proceed to resolve all relevant issues in the case pursuant to the rules of procedure applicable to family law cases.

E. A trial held pursuant to this section shall be made to the court.

 

#### Section 25-807. Precedence of maternity and paternity proceedings; delay for paternity tests; court order; evidentiary use; alternative tests; out-of-state orders; immunity

A. Proceedings to establish maternity and paternity have precedence over other civil proceedings. The case shall be set for trial within sixty days from the filing of an answer by the respondent.

B. A delay in determining paternity in an action commenced before the birth of the child shall be granted until after the birth of the child for purposes of paternity tests if any party to the proceedings requests.

C. The court, on its own motion or on motion of any party to the proceedings, shall order the mother, her child or children and the alleged father to submit to genetic testing and shall direct that inherited characteristics to determine parentage, including blood and tissue type, be determined by appropriate testing procedures conducted by an accredited laboratory.  If the mother is unavailable or fails to cooperate by refusing to submit to genetic testing, testing of the alleged father and child or children may be appropriate. An expert duly qualified as an examiner of genetic markers shall be agreed on by the parties or appointed by the court to analyze and interpret the results and report to the court.

D. If the results of the genetic tests indicate that the likelihood of the alleged father's paternity is ninety-five per cent or greater, the alleged father is presumed to be the parent of the child and the party opposing the establishment of the alleged father's paternity shall establish by clear and convincing evidence that the alleged father is not the father of the child.

E. The examiner's report shall be admitted at trial unless a timely written challenge to the examiner's report is filed with the court within twenty days of the date the report was filed with the court. If the results of the examiner's report have been challenged and on the reasonable request of a party, the court shall order an additional test to be made by the same laboratory or an independent laboratory at the expense of the party requesting additional testing.

F. If a timely written challenge is not filed pursuant to subsection E, the examiner's report is admissible in evidence without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy.

G. The court, on application of either party, shall determine the proportion and time in which the initial test costs shall be paid.

H. On motion of a party to the proceedings, the court may order that experts perform alternative or additional tests including medical, scientific and genetic tests.

I. Either party may apply for summary judgment on the issue of paternity.

J. A state or local agency in this state, including the department of economic security, the department of child safety, the state department of corrections and any other correctional facility that has custody of a person who is the subject of the genetic testing order, shall treat a genetic testing order issued in another state that appears to be in good order as if it were issued by a court of this state.

K. Notwithstanding any other law, an agency, agency employee or agency contractor that acts in good faith to cooperate in obtaining genetic testing samples under this section is not subject to civil or criminal liability.

 

#### Section 25-808. Preliminary injunction; temporary restraining order; effect

A. In an action to establish legal decision-making and parenting time for a child who was born out of wedlock, the clerk of the court shall issue, pursuant to an order of the superior court, a preliminary injunction that is directed to each party to the action if the petitioner has filed one of the following:

1. A copy of the birth certificate that lists the father as parent.

2. An affidavit or acknowledgement signed by the father admitting paternity.

3. An adoption order listing both parties as parents.

4. A court order establishing paternity.

B. The preliminary injunction shall contain the following orders:

1. That both parties are enjoined from all of the following:

(a) Molesting, harassing, disturbing the peace of or committing an assault or battery on the person of the other party or any natural or adopted child of the parties.

(b) Removing any natural or adopted child of the parties then residing in this state from the jurisdiction of the court without the prior written consent of the parties or the permission of the court.

(c) Removing or causing to be removed any child of the parties from any existing insurance coverage, including medical, hospital, dental, automobile or disability insurance.

2. That both parties maintain all insurance coverage in full force and effect.

C. The preliminary injunction prescribed in subsection A of this section shall include the following statement:

Warning

This is an official court order.  If you disobey this order the court may find you in contempt of court.  You may also be arrested and prosecuted for the crime of interfering with judicial proceedings and any other crime you may have committed in disobeying this order.  You or the other party may file a certified copy of this order with your local law enforcement agency.  A certified copy may be obtained from the clerk of the court that issued this order.  If you are the person who brought this action, you must also file evidence with the law enforcement agency that this order was served on the other party.  This court order is effective until a final order of paternity, legal decision-making or parenting time is filed or the action is dismissed.

D. The preliminary injunction is effective against the petitioner when the petition is filed and against the respondent on service of a copy of the order or on actual notice of the order, whichever is sooner.  If service is by registered mail under the Arizona rules of family law procedure, the order is effective on receipt of the order.  The order remains effective until further order of the court or the entry of paternity, legal decision-making or parenting time.

E. At the time of filing the petition for paternity, legal decision-making or parenting time, the copies of the preliminary injunction shall be issued to the petitioner or the agent, servant or employee filing the petition for paternity, legal decision-making or parenting time. The petitioner is deemed to have accepted service of the petitioner's copy of the preliminary injunction and to have actual notice of its contents by filing or causing to be filed a petition for paternity, legal decision-making or parenting time. The petitioner shall cause a copy of the preliminary injunction to be served on the respondent with a copy of the summons and petition for paternity, legal decision-making or parenting time.

F. The preliminary injunction has the force and effect of an order of the superior court signed by a judge and is enforceable by all remedies made available by law, including contempt of court.

G. The court may issue a temporary restraining order without requiring notice to the other party only if it finds on the basis of the moving affidavit or other evidence that irreparable injury will result to the moving party if no order is issued until the time for responding has elapsed. A bond is not required unless the court deems it appropriate.

H. A temporary order or preliminary injunction:

1. Does not prejudice the rights of the parties or of any child that are to be adjudicated at the subsequent hearings in the proceeding.

2. May be revoked or modified before the final decree on a showing by affidavit of the facts necessary for revocation or modification of a final decree.

3. Terminates when the final order is entered or when the petition is dismissed.

I. A person who disobeys or resists a preliminary injunction in violation of subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section is subject to arrest and prosecution for interference with judicial proceedings pursuant to section 13-2810 and the following procedures apply:

1. Any party may cause a certified copy of the injunction and return of service on the other party to be registered with the sheriff having jurisdiction of the area in which the party resides.  The party originally registering the injunction shall register any changes or modifications of the injunction with the sheriff.  For enforcement by arrest and prosecution for interference with judicial proceedings, a certified copy of the injunction, whether or not registered with the sheriff, is presumed to be a valid existing order of the court until a final order is entered or the action is dismissed.

2. A peace officer, with or without a warrant, may arrest a person if the peace officer has probable cause to believe that an offense under this subsection has been committed and has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed the offense, whether the offense is a felony or a misdemeanor and whether the offense was committed within or without the presence of the peace officer.  The release procedures available under section 13-3883, subsection A, paragraph 4 and section 13-3903 are not applicable to arrests made pursuant to this paragraph.

3. A peace officer making an arrest pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection is not civilly or criminally liable for the arrest if the officer acts on probable cause and without malice.

4. A person arrested pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection may be released from custody in accordance with the Arizona rules of criminal procedure or other applicable statute.  An order for release, with or without an appearance bond, shall include pretrial release conditions necessary to provide for the protection of the alleged victim and other specifically designated persons and may provide additional conditions that the court deems appropriate, including participation in any counseling programs available to the defendant.

5. The remedies provided in this subsection for enforcement of the preliminary injunction are in addition to any other civil or criminal remedies available, including civil contempt of court.  The use of one remedy does not prevent the simultaneous or subsequent use of any other remedy.

 

#### Section 25-809. Judgment

A. Except as provided in section 25-501, subsection F, if a respondent admits parentage or if the issue is decided in the affirmative in an action instituted during the child's minority, the court shall direct, subject to applicable equitable defenses and using a retroactive application of the current child support guidelines, the amount, if any, the parties shall pay for the past support of the child and the manner in which payment shall be made.

B. The court shall enter an order for support determined to be due for the period between the commencement of the proceeding and the date that current child support is ordered to begin.  The court shall not order past support retroactive to more than three years before the commencement of the proceeding unless the court makes a written finding of good cause after considering all relevant circumstances, including:

1. The circumstances, conduct or motivation of the party who claims entitlement to past support in not seeking an earlier establishment of maternity or paternity.

2. The circumstances, conduct or motivation of the party from whom past support is sought in impeding the establishment of maternity or paternity.

3. The diligence with which service of process was attempted on the respondent.

C. The court shall also direct the amount either parent shall pay for the actual costs of the pregnancy, childbirth and any genetic testing and other related costs subject to production of billing statements or other documentation. This documentation is prima facie evidence of amounts incurred and is admissible in evidence without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy.

D. In any proceeding under this article the court shall order either parent or both parents to pay any monies reasonable and necessary for the support of the minor unemancipated child until the child reaches the age of majority or is emancipated.  In determining the amount of support for the child, the court shall apply the child support guidelines pursuant to section 25-320, subsection D.  If a child reaches the age of majority while the child is attending high school or a certified high school equivalency program, support shall continue to be provided while the child is actually attending high school or the equivalency program but only until the child reaches nineteen years of age unless the court enters an order pursuant to subsection F of this section.

E. The court may modify an order of support pursuant to section 25-503.

F. Even if a child is over the age of majority when a petition is filed or at the time of the final decree, the court may order support to continue past the age of majority if all of the following are true:

1. The court has considered the factors prescribed in subsection D of this section.

2. The child has severe mental or physical disabilities as demonstrated by the fact that the child is unable to live independently and be self-supporting.

3. The child's disability began before the child reached the age of majority.

G. After considering the financial resources of both parties and the reasonableness of the positions each party has taken throughout the proceedings, the court may order a party to pay a reasonable amount to the other party for the costs and expenses of maintaining or defending any proceeding under this article.  The court may order the party to pay these amounts directly to the attorney.  The attorney may enforce the order in the attorney's name with the same force and effect and in the same manner as if the order had been made on behalf of any party to the action.  For the purposes of this subsection, "costs and expenses" includes attorney fees, deposition costs, appellate costs and other reasonable expenses the court determines were necessary.

H. The court has contempt powers to enforce its orders.

I. The parties may terminate an action brought under this article by agreement and compromise only if the court has approved the terms of the agreement and compromise.

 

#### Section 25-810. Liability of parents if putative mother or father is a minor; periodic payments

A. Except as provided pursuant to section 25-501, subsection F, the parent or parents having custody or control of the putative mother or father may be joined as respondents in the action if the putative mother or father is a minor or was a minor at the time the action was commenced. The parents may be held jointly and severally liable with the minor until the minor reaches the age of majority.

B. The court may order that a judgment made against a parent pursuant to this section be satisfied through periodic payments as other child support orders.

C. In addition to the enforcement of support remedies provided pursuant to section 25-508, an order made pursuant to this section that provides for periodic payments shall be enforced pursuant to this chapter.

 

#### Section 25-812. Voluntary acknowledgment of paternity; action to overcome paternity

A. This state or the parent of a child born out of wedlock may establish the paternity of a child by filing one of the following with the clerk of the superior court, the department of economic security or the department of health services:

1. A notarized or witnessed statement that contains the social security numbers of both parents and that is signed by both parents acknowledging paternity or two separate substantially similar notarized or witnessed statements acknowledging paternity. If the voluntary acknowledgment is filed with the court, the filing party must redact any social security numbers and file them separately pursuant to section 25-501, subsection G.  If another man is presumed to be the child's father pursuant to section 25-814, an acknowledgment of paternity is valid only with the presumed father's written consent or as prescribed pursuant to section 25-814. A statement that is witnessed by an employee of the department of economic security or the department of health services or by an employee of a hospital must contain the printed name and residential or business address of the witness.  A statement that is witnessed by any other person must contain the printed name and residential address of the witness. If the acknowledgment of paternity is witnessed, the witness must be an adult who is not related to either parent by blood or by marriage.

2. An agreement by the parents to be bound by the results of genetic testing including any genetic test previously accepted by a court of competent jurisdiction, or any combination of genetic testing agreed to by the parties, and an affidavit from a certified laboratory that the tested father has not been excluded.

B. On filing a document required in subsection A of this section with the clerk of the superior court, the clerk or authorized court personnel shall issue an order establishing paternity, which may amend the name of the child or children, if requested by the parents.  The clerk shall transmit a copy of the order of paternity to the department of health services and the department of economic security.

C. On entry of an order by the clerk of the superior court, the paternity determination has the same force and effect as a judgment of the superior court.  In a non-title IV-D case, the clerk shall transmit a copy of an order granted under this subsection to the state title IV-D agency. The case filing fee prescribed by section 12-284 shall not be charged to any person who, in the same county, initiates or responds to a proceeding to establish child support or to obtain an order for custody or parenting time within ninety days after an order establishing paternity is issued under subsection B of this section.

D. A voluntary acknowledgment of paternity executed pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section may be filed with the department of economic security, which shall provide a copy to the department of health services.  A voluntary acknowledgment of paternity made pursuant to this section is a determination of paternity and has the same force and effect as a superior court judgment.

E. Pursuant to rule 85(c) of the Arizona rules of family law procedure, the mother, father or child, or a party to the proceeding on a rule 85(c) motion, may challenge a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity established in this state at any time after the sixty day period only on the basis of fraud, duress or material mistake of fact, with the burden of proof on the challenger and under which the legal responsibilities, including child support obligations of any signatory arising from the acknowledgment shall not be suspended during the challenge except for good cause shown.  The court shall order the mother, her child or children and the alleged father to submit to genetic testing and shall direct that appropriate testing procedures determine the inherited characteristics, including blood and tissue type.  If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the genetic tests demonstrate that the established father is not the biological father of the child, the court shall vacate the determination of paternity and terminate the obligation of that party to pay ongoing child support. An order vacating the determination of paternity operates prospectively only and does not alter the obligation to pay child support arrearages or, unless otherwise ordered by the court, any other amount previously ordered to be paid pursuant to section 25-809.

F. Before signing a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity pursuant to this section, the parties shall be provided notice of the alternatives to, the legal consequences of and the rights and responsibilities that arise from signing the acknowledgment.

G. The department of economic security shall notify the department of health services of all paternity determinations and rescissions.

H. The mother or the father may rescind the acknowledgment of paternity within the earlier of:

1. Sixty days after the last signature is affixed to the notarized acknowledgment of paternity that is filed with the department of economic security, the department of health services or the clerk of the court.

2. The date of a proceeding relating to the child, including a child support proceeding in which the mother or father is a party.

I. A rescission authorized pursuant to subsection H of this section must be in writing and a copy of each rescission of paternity shall be filed with the department of economic security. The department of economic security shall mail a copy of the rescission of paternity to the other parent and to the department of health services.

J. Voluntary acknowledgments of paternity and rescissions of paternity filed pursuant to this section shall contain data elements in accordance with the requirements of the United States secretary of health and human services.

 

#### Section 25-813. Default order of paternity

In an action to establish paternity, the court shall enter an order of paternity if either:

1. The service of summons is complete and the respondent fails to appear or otherwise answer.

2. An order for genetic or blood testing has been entered and the respondent fails to appear without cause for an appointment to take a blood or genetic test or fails to take a blood or genetic test.

 

#### Section 25-814. Presumption of paternity

A. A man is presumed to be the father of the child if:

1. He and the mother of the child were married at any time in the ten months immediately preceding the birth or the child is born within ten months after the marriage is terminated by death, annulment, declaration of invalidity or dissolution of marriage or after the court enters a decree of legal separation.

2. Genetic testing affirms at least a ninety-five per cent probability of paternity.

3. A birth certificate is signed by the mother and father of a child born out of wedlock.

4. A notarized or witnessed statement is signed by both parents acknowledging paternity or separate substantially similar notarized or witnessed statements are signed by both parents acknowledging paternity.

B. If another man is presumed to be the child's father under subsection A, paragraph 1, an acknowledgment of paternity may be effected only with the written consent of the presumed father or after the presumption is rebutted.  If the presumed father has died or cannot reasonably be located, paternity may be established without written consent.

C. Any presumption under this section shall be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. If two or more presumptions apply, the presumption that the court determines, on the facts, is based on weightier considerations of policy and logic will control. A court decree establishing paternity of the child by another man rebuts the presumption.

#### Section 25-815. Paternity; full faith and credit

If paternity has been established in another state by a court or administrative order or voluntary acknowledgment, the determination of paternity has the same force and effect in this state as if the determination of paternity was granted by a court in this state.

#### Section 25-816. Title IV-D child support; paternity establishment; genetic testing

A. On receipt of a sworn statement by the mother or the alleged father alleging paternity and setting forth the facts establishing a reasonable possibility of the requisite sexual contact between the parties, the department of economic security or its agent may order the mother, her child or children and the alleged father to submit to the drawing of blood or tissue samples for genetic testing of a type generally acknowledged as reliable by accreditation bodies.  If the mother cannot be located the department or its agent may order the caretaker of the child or children to present the child or children for genetic testing.  The order shall be served by first class mail or delivered at least ten business days before the genetic testing.  The department or its agent shall pay the costs of the test subject to repayment from the mother or the alleged father if paternity is established. An order of genetic testing issued by the department or its agent has the same force and effect as a superior court order.

B. If the results of the genetic testing indicate that the likelihood of the alleged father's paternity is ninety-five per cent or greater, the alleged father is presumed to be the parent of the child and the party opposing the establishment of the alleged father's paternity shall establish by clear and convincing evidence that he is not the father of the child.

C. A person who is tested pursuant to this section may contest the test results in writing to the department or its agent within thirty days after the department or its agent mails the results to that person. If the original test results are contested in a timely manner, on request and advance payment by the requesting party, the department or its agent shall order a second genetic test pursuant to subsection A.

 

#### Section 25-817. Temporary orders; presumption of paternity

A. Pending a judicial determination of paternity, the court shall issue a temporary order of support, and may issue a temporary order regarding custody and parenting time, if any of the following applies:

1. Genetic testing affirms at least a ninety-five per cent probability of paternity.

2. A notarized or witnessed statement is signed by both parents acknowledging paternity or separate substantially similar notarized or witnessed statements are signed acknowledging paternity and filed with the department of health services pursuant to section 36-334 or filed with the department of economic security.

3. The respondent admits or does not deny paternity in a written response filed with the clerk of the court.

B. A temporary order issued pursuant to this section does not prejudice the rights of a person or child that are adjudicated at subsequent hearings in the proceeding.

C. A temporary order issued pursuant to this section may be revoked or modified and terminates when the final support, custody or parenting time order is entered or when the petition for support, custody or parenting time is dismissed.

 

#### Section 25-818. Paternity case registry; acknowledgments and paternity and maternity orders; recording requirements

A. The department of economic security shall maintain a paternity case registry for this state.  Public and private entities that obtain or receive a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity shall promptly transmit the original signed and completed acknowledgment to the department of economic security. This requirement does not apply to the superior court.

B. The department of economic security may dispose of an original voluntary acknowledgment of paternity not sooner than one year after the date of the last signature on the acknowledgment and only after it makes an electronic copy of the original acknowledgment.

C. The clerk of the superior court shall transmit a copy of each order of paternity or maternity to the department of economic security.

D. The department of economic security shall maintain automated records regarding the parents and any child whose name is stated in a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity or an order of paternity or maternity.

E. The clerk of the superior court, the department of economic security and the department of health services shall cooperate to ensure that the state registrar of vital records receives a copy of a voluntary acknowledgment of paternity or order of paternity or maternity relating to any child born in this state.

A. If section 25-1313 does not apply, on petition, a tribunal of this state may modify a child support order issued in another state that is registered in this state if, after notice and a hearing, it finds that any of the following is true:

1. The following requirements are met:

(a) Neither the child, the obligee who is an individual nor the obligor resides in the issuing state.

(b) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification.

(c) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state.

2. This state is the residence of the child, or a party who is an individual is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the parties who are individuals have filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

B. Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements, procedures and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this state, and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.

C. A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may not be modified under the laws of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of support.  If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same child, the order that controls and must be recognized under section 25-1227 establishes the aspects of the support order that are nonmodifiable.

D. In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of support.  The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.

E. On issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child support order issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal having continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

F. Notwithstanding this section and section 25-1221, subsection B, a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if both of the following are true:

1. One party resides in another state.

2. The other party resides outside the United States.

 

#### Section 25-1312. Recognition of order modified in another state

If a child support order issued by a tribunal of this state is modified by a tribunal of another state that assumed jurisdiction pursuant to the uniform interstate family support act, a tribunal of this state:

1. May enforce the order that was modified only as to arrears and interest accruing before the modification.

2. May provide appropriate relief for violations of its order that occurred before the effective date of the modification.

3. Shall recognize the modifying order of the other state, on registration, for the purpose of enforcement.

#### Section 25-1313. Jurisdiction to modify child support order of another state if individual parties reside in this state

A. If all of the individual parties reside in this state and the child does not reside in the issuing state, a tribunal of this state has jurisdiction to enforce and modify the issuing state's child support order in a proceeding to register that order.

B. A tribunal of this state exercising jurisdiction as provided in this section shall apply the provisions of this article and articles 1 and 2 of this chapter to the enforcement or modification proceeding. Articles 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 of this chapter do not apply, and the tribunal shall apply the procedural and substantive laws of this state.

 

#### Section 25-1314. Notice to issuing tribunal of modification

Within thirty days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal that had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order and in each tribunal in which the party knows the earlier order has been registered. A party that obtains the order and fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which the issue of failure to file arises. The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability of the modified order of the new tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.

 

#### Section 25-1315. Jurisdiction to modify child support order of foreign country

A. Except as provided in section 25-1341, if a foreign country lacks or refuses to exercise jurisdiction to modify its child support order pursuant to its laws, a tribunal of this state may assume jurisdiction to modify the child support order and bind all individuals subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal whether the consent to modification of a child support order otherwise required of the individual pursuant to section 25-1311 has been given or whether the individual seeking modification is a resident of this state or of the foreign country.

B. An order issued by a tribunal of this state modifying a foreign child support order pursuant to this section is the controlling order.

 

#### Section 25-1316. Procedure to register child support order of foreign country for modification

A party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify, or to modify and enforce, a foreign child support order not under the convention may register that order in this state in the same manner as provided in sections 25-1301, 25-1302, 25-1303, 25-1304, 25-1305, 25-1306, 25-1307 and 25-1308 if the order has not been registered.  A petition for modification may be filed at the same time as a request for registration, or at another time. The petition must specify the grounds for modification.

#### Section 25-1501. Alleged incapacitated person; guardian ad litem

A. In a proceeding filed pursuant to this title, if the court finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that an adult party is or may be an incapacitated person as defined in section 14-5101 or is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 14-5401 and that the party is or may be in need of guardianship or conservatorship, or both, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem to conduct an investigation concerning the need for a guardian or conservator, or both.
