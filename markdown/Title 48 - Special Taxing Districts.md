#### Section 48-261. District creation; procedures; notice; hearing; determinations; petitions

A. A fire district, community park maintenance district, sanitary district or hospital district for either a hospital or an urgent care center shall be created by the following procedures:

1. Any adult person desiring to propose creation of a district shall provide a legal description of the area proposed for inclusion in the district to the county assessor of the county in which the district is to be located.  The county assessor shall provide to the person proposing formation of the district a detailed list of all taxable properties in the area proposed for inclusion in the district. The person proposing formation of the district shall prepare and submit a district impact statement to the board of supervisors of the county in which the district is to be located. The county assessor's parcel map and the assessed valuation of the properties as prescribed by section 42-17052 and as shown in the county assessor's records at the time the district impact statement is submitted are deemed sufficient for any required maps and for determining the assessed valuations prescribed by this section. Except for a proposed community park maintenance district that is to be located in more than one county, if a proposed district is located in more than one county, the impact statement shall be submitted to the board of supervisors of the county in which the majority of the assessed valuation of the proposed district is located. The boards of supervisors of any other counties in which a portion of the district is to be located shall provide information and assistance to the responsible board of supervisors.  For a community park maintenance district that is to be located in more than one county, the impact statement shall be submitted to the board of supervisors for each of the affected counties. If the person desiring to create a district pursuant to this section is unable to complete the district impact statement, the board of supervisors may assist in the completion of the impact statement if requested to do so, provided the bond required in subsection C of this section is in an amount sufficient to cover any additional cost to the county. The district impact statement shall contain at least the following information:

(a) A legal description of the boundaries of the proposed district and a map and a general description of the area to be included in the district sufficiently detailed to permit a property owner to determine whether a particular property is within the proposed district.

(b) The detailed list of taxable properties provided by the assessor pursuant to this paragraph.

(c) An estimate of the assessed valuation within the proposed district.

(d) An estimate of the change in the property tax liability, as a result of the proposed district, of a typical resident of the proposed district.

2. On receipt of the district impact statement, the board of supervisors shall set a day, at least thirty but not more than sixty days after that date, for a hearing on the impact statement. The board of supervisors, at any time before making a determination pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subsection, may require that the impact statement be amended to include any information that the board of supervisors deems to be relevant and necessary.

3. On receipt of the district impact statement, the clerk of the board of supervisors shall mail, by first class mail, notice of the day, hour and place of the hearing on the proposed district to each owner of taxable property within the boundaries of the proposed district. The written notice shall state the purpose of the hearing and shall state where a copy of the impact statement may be viewed or requested.  The clerk of the board of supervisors shall post the notice in at least three conspicuous public places in the area of the proposed district and shall publish twice in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area of the proposed district, at least ten days before the hearing, or, if no daily newspaper of general circulation exists in the area of the proposed district, at least twice at any time before the date of the hearing, a notice setting forth the purpose of the impact statement, the description of the area of the proposed district and the day, hour and place of the hearing.

4. At the hearing called pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection, the board of supervisors shall hear those who appear for and against the proposed district and shall determine whether the creation of the district will promote public health, comfort, convenience, necessity or welfare. If the board of supervisors determines that the public health, comfort, convenience, necessity or welfare will be promoted, it shall approve the district impact statement and authorize the circulation of petitions as provided in this subsection.  For a community park maintenance district that is required to obtain the approval of more than one county's board of supervisors, the petitions may only be circulated after approval of the board of supervisors from each affected county.  The order of the board of supervisors shall be final, but if the request to circulate petitions is denied, a subsequent request for a similar district may be refiled with the board of supervisors after six months from the date of the denial.  The county board of supervisors shall authorize the circulation of petitions of only one proposed new district of the same type in which any property owner's land is proposed for inclusion. A new petition circulation shall not be authorized until the one-year period to submit signatures prescribed by paragraph 6 of this subsection of the original petition circulation has expired or has otherwise been extinguished.

5. Within fifteen days after receiving the approval of the board of supervisors as prescribed by paragraph 4 of this subsection, the clerk of the board shall determine the minimum number of signatures and assessed valuation required for compliance with paragraph 7 of this subsection.

The items required to be contained with the petition under this subdivision shall be printed on the back of the petition form required pursuant to section 48-266 unless the size of the items precludes compliance with this requirement.  An error in the legal description of the proposed district shall not invalidate the petitions if considered as a whole the information provided is sufficient to identify the property as illustrated in the map required pursuant to this subdivision.

(b) Be signed by owners of more than one-half of the taxable property units in the area of the proposed district and be signed by persons owning collectively more than one-half of the assessed valuation of the property in the area of the proposed district.  Property exempt pursuant to title 42, chapter 11, article 3 shall not be considered in determining the total assessed valuation of the proposed district nor shall owners of property not subject to taxation be eligible to sign petitions.

8. On receipt of the petitions, including any supplemental signatures, and the report of the county assessor, the board of supervisors shall set a day for a hearing on the petition.

9. Before the hearing called pursuant to paragraph 8 of this subsection, the board of supervisors shall determine the validity of the petitions presented.

B. For the purpose of determining the validity of the petitions presented pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 6 of this section:

1. Property held in multiple ownership shall be treated as if it had only one property owner, and the signature of only one of the owners of property held in multiple ownership is required on the formation petition.  The number of persons owning property inside the boundaries of the proposed district shall be determined as follows:

(a) In the case of property assessed by the county assessor, the number of persons owning property shall be as shown on the most recent assessment of property.

(b) In the case of property valued by the department of revenue, the number of persons owning property shall be as shown on the most recent valuation of property.

The board of supervisors may require of the person desiring to propose creation of a district pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section a reasonable bond to be filed with the board at the start of proceedings under this section.  The bond shall be in an amount sufficient to cover costs incurred by the county if the district is not finally organized. County costs covered by the bond include any expense incurred from completion of the district impact statement, mailing of the notice of hearing to district property owners, publication of the notice of hearing and other expenses reasonably incurred as a result of any requirements of this section.

D. If a district is created pursuant to this section, the cost of publication of the notice of hearing, the cost of the mailing of notices to property owners, the cost of the bond and all other costs incurred by the county as a result of this section shall be a charge against the district.

E. If a proposed district would include property located within an incorporated city or town, in addition to the other requirements of subsection A of this section, the board shall approve the creation and authorize the circulation of petitions only if the governing body of the city or town has by ordinance or resolution endorsed the creation.

F. Except as provided in section 48-851 and section 48-2001, subsection A, the area of a district created pursuant to this section shall be contiguous.

G.

The person proposing any change to the boundaries of the district shall prepare and submit a boundary change impact statement to the governing body of the district.

If the property is located in an incorporated city or town, in addition to the other requirements prescribed in this subsection, the governing body of the fire district or sanitary district may approve the boundary change only if the governing body of the affected city or town by ordinance or resolution has approved the inclusion of the property in the district. If the governing body determines that the inclusion of that property will benefit the district and the property owner, the boundary change may be made by order of the governing body and is final on the recording of the governing body's order that includes a legal description of the property that is added to the district.  A petition and impact statement are not required for an amendment to a sanitary district's or fire district's boundaries made pursuant to this subsection.

J. Until August 1, 2014, in a county with a population greater than two million persons, notwithstanding subsection I of this section, any property owner, including the United States, this state or a county, whose land is within two thousand six hundred forty feet of an adjacent sanitary district or fire district, not contiguous to the boundaries of the sanitary district or fire district and within an unincorporated area or county island may request in writing that the governing body of the district amend the district boundaries to include that property owner's land.

K. A fire district shall not annex or otherwise add territory that is already included in another existing fire district, unless deannexed pursuant to subsections D, E and F of this section.

L. A fire district, community park maintenance district or sanitary district may appropriate and spend monies as necessary or reasonably required to assist one or more individuals or entities to change the district's boundaries pursuant to this section.

M. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, if an incorporated city or town has previously adopted a resolution designating a fire district as the fire service agency for the city or town, the jurisdictional boundaries of the fire district without further notice or election shall be changed to include any property annexed into the city or town. If the annexation occurs pursuant to a joint petition for annexation, any joint petition for annexation shall clearly indicate in its title and in the notice required in the petition that the property to be annexed will be subject to the jurisdiction of both the city or town and the fire district.  A joint petition for annexation shall comply with both section 9-471 and this section.  Any fire district boundary change that occurs through city or town annexation pursuant to this subsection is effective on the effective date of the annexation by the incorporated city or town.  If an incorporated city or town that has designated a fire district as the fire service agency for that city or town annexes property that is already part of another fire district, the annexed property shall remain part of the fire district in which it was located before the city or town's annexation.

N. Notwithstanding subsection I of this section, from August 2, 2012 until July 1, 2015, in counties with a population of more than two million five hundred thousand persons, any property owner, including the United States, this state or a county, whose land is within two thousand six hundred forty feet of an adjacent sanitary district or fire district and is not contiguous to the boundaries of the sanitary district or fire district may request in writing that the governing body of the district amend the district boundaries to include that property owner's land. If the property is located in an incorporated city or town, in addition to the other requirements prescribed in this subsection, the governing body of the sanitary district or fire district may approve the boundary change only if the governing body of the affected city or town, by ordinance or resolution, has approved the inclusion of the property in the district. If the governing body determines that the inclusion of that property will benefit the district and the property owner, the boundary change may be made by order of the governing body and is final on the recording of the governing body's order that includes a general description of the property, including the assessor's parcel number, that is added to the district. A petition and impact statement are not required for an amendment to a sanitary district's or fire district's boundaries made pursuant to this subsection.

O. For the purposes of this section, assessed valuation does not include property exempt pursuant to title 42, chapter 11, article 3.

B. The referees, the court or the jury, shall find separately the value of each parcel of property sought to be condemned, and all improvements thereon pertaining to the realty and of each separate estate or interest therein.

C. If the proceedings in the superior court result in decreasing the amount necessary to pay compensation and damages, the amount of decrease shall be prorated among the parcels assessed and credited on the taxes of the city or town assessed on the respective parcels.

#### Section 48-557. Deficiency in fund; temporary advancements

If there is a deficiency in the funds collected from the special assessments, the municipality shall make good the deficiency by transferring into the special fund out of its general fund an amount sufficient to make such deficiency good, reimbursing itself from the funds collected from the installments when they are received, or from any monies thereafter coming into the fund.

B. The powers and duties of the governing body of the municipality and the procedure to be followed shall be as provided in this article for other types of special improvement districts.

C. If a petition for the formation of an improvement district under the provisions of this section is presented to the governing body purporting to be signed by all of the real property owners in the proposed district, exclusive of mortgagees and other lienholders, the governing body, after verifying such ownership and making a finding of such fact, shall adopt a resolution of intention to order the improvement pursuant to the provisions of section 48-576 and shall have immediate jurisdiction to adopt the resolution ordering the improvement pursuant to the provisions of section 48-581, without the necessity of the publication and posting of the resolution of intention provided for in section 48-578.

D. The engineer shall make duplicate diagrams of the property contained within the improvement district. The diagram shall show each separate lot numbered consecutively, the area in square feet of each lot, and the area in square feet of any building or buildings located on each lot. Prior to making any assessment upon the district, the diagram shall be approved by the governing body.

E. The governing body shall make annual statements and estimates of the expenses of the district, and shall assess the total sum upon the several lots, each respectively in proportion to the benefits to be received by each lot. When the assessments have been completed, the governing body shall fix a time when it will hear and pass upon the assessments and the prior proceedings relating thereto which shall not be less than twenty days from the date of the notice. Notice of hearing shall be given in the manner provided by section 48-590, subsection E. Any person owning real property affected by the assessment who has any objection to the legality of the assessment, or to any of the previous proceedings connected therewith, may prior to the time fixed for the hearing file a written notice briefly specifying the grounds of the objection. At the time fixed for the hearing or at any time not later than ten days thereafter to which the hearing may be postponed, the governing body shall hear and pass upon the objections. The decision of the governing body shall be final and conclusive upon all persons entitled to object as to all errors, informalities and irregularities which the governing body might have remedied or avoided any time during the progress of the proceedings.

F. The assessments for the annual expenses shall be collectible in the manner and by the officers provided by law for the collection and enforcement of general taxes the municipality is authorized to levy. All statutes providing for the levy and collection of county and city taxes, including the collection of delinquent taxes and sale of property for nonpayment of taxes, shall be applicable to the district assessments provided for under this section.

G. An improvement district formed under the provisions of this section shall not be authorized to issue improvement bonds.

H. No improvement district formed under the provisions of this section shall be authorized to engage in any activity other than as provided in subsection A of this section. If the municipality is willing to participate in the cost of the district, the governing body may, by resolution, summarily order such participation.

I. The formation of an improvement district under the provisions of this section shall not prevent the subsequent establishment of improvement districts for any other purpose authorized by law.

J. If, in the opinion of the governing body, any territory of a district formed under this section is not benefited by being a part of the district, the governing body may, by resolution, exempt such territory from assessment under this chapter, or if any portion of the territory of a district formed under this section is no longer benefited by being a part of the district, the governing body may, by resolution, summarily delete from the district formed under this section any such area and may form a new district from the balance of the original district formed under this section.

K. Any real property that is within the boundaries of the district, that is utilized for residential purposes and that is not specifically benefited by the public services at a higher level or greater degree shall be exempt from assessment pursuant to this section for that year. Existing improved real property utilized for residential purposes with four units or less per building at the time of formation of the district is presumed to not be specifically benefited by a public service at a higher level or greater degree.

L. Within ten days after adoption of the resolution of intention to order the improvement, the municipality shall record the resolution in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the district is located in such a way as to give notice of formation of the district to all property owners within the district.

M. If, in the opinion of the governing body of the municipality, territory adjacent to a district formed under this section would benefit from being a part of the district, the governing body, by resolution, may include the territory in the district formed under this section if all of the following conditions are met:

1. Including the territory in the district will not adversely affect the district.

2. Notice of the proposed inclusion of the territory in the district has been published in five consecutive issues of a daily newspaper or two consecutive issues of a weekly or semiweekly newspaper of general circulation published in the municipality and a public hearing has been held to consider the inclusion of the territory in the district.

3. Notice, including an accurate map of the territory proposed for inclusion in the district, has been sent by first class mail at least ten days before the hearing prescribed in paragraph 2 to each owner of property listed on the tax roll within the district and in territory that is now or would be subject to taxation by the district in the event of inclusion of the territory.

N. Within ten days after the governing body of the municipality adopts a resolution pursuant to subsection M of this section, the municipality shall record the resolution in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the district is located to give notice of the inclusion of the territory in the district to all property owners in the district. If, before the governing body of the municipality adopts the resolution pursuant to subsection M of this section, a majority of the property owners, by area, of either the original district formed under this section or the territory proposed to be included in the district files with the governing body of the municipality written objections to the proposed inclusion of the territory, the territory shall not be included in the district.

O. An improvement district to provide enhanced municipal services may continue to exist in an area that is no longer in a designated area as defined in section 48-571, if at the time of district formation all of the following apply:

1. The area contained in the improvement district has been in a designated area for five or more years.

2. Not more than ten per cent of the frontage of the property fronting on the proposed improvement, or if the cost of the improvement is to be made chargeable on a district, not more than ten per cent of the frontage of the property contained within the limits of the improvement district, is owned by the same person.

3. Not more than one-third of the property owners by frontage of the area contained in the improvement district files with the governing body of the municipality written objections to the improvement district.

4. The municipality otherwise complies with the provisions of this article for the process of forming the improvement district.

#### Section 48-576. Resolution or ordinance of intention to order improvement; petition

A. Before ordering an improvement authorized by this article, the governing body of the municipality shall comply with both of the following:

1. Pass a resolution or ordinance of intention so to do, briefly describing the improvement. By the resolution or ordinance and the proceedings subsequent thereto, one or more improvements may be made on one or more streets and shall constitute one improvement and be constructed under one or more contracts. The resolution or ordinance of intention may be combined in a single resolution or ordinance of intention to open, extend, widen, straighten or close public streets or off-street parking areas pursuant to section 48-505. If the work proposed is already done for a lot, the lot shall be excepted from the assessment therefor to the extent of the work done.

2. If the governing body determines that the district should be formed after the final resolution of any protests made pursuant to section 48-579, the governing body shall submit within one hundred twenty days to the city or town clerk a petition to form the district that is signed by owners of more than one-half of the taxable property units within the area of the proposed district and that is signed by persons owning collectively more than one-half of the assessed valuation of the property within the area of the proposed district.  Property that is exempt pursuant to title 42, chapter 11, article 3 is not considered in determining the total assessed valuation of the proposed district and owners of property that is not subject to taxation are not eligible to sign the petition. On verification of the petition signatures, the governing body may form the improvement district and order the improvement as otherwise provided by law.

B. When the proposed improvement, in the opinion of the governing body, is of more than local or ordinary public benefit, it may order the expense of the improvement chargeable upon a district, and shall describe the extent of the district in general terms in its resolution or ordinance of intention, either by reference to street lines or block numbers, or by designating its exterior boundaries by their courses and distances from the street or streets the improvement of which is contemplated, and may refer for a more particular description thereof to a map on file with the city or town engineer, showing the exterior boundary lines of the district, and delineating block and lot numbers or containing such details as will show the location of the lines. A city or town shall not assess the costs of an improvement which is for the general public benefit against land in an assessment district. If a portion of the expense of an improvement is for general public benefit, the city or town shall assess the district only that portion of the expense which benefits the property within the district.

C. The governing body, in the resolution or ordinance of intention, may provide that the improvement described therein may be made according to any of several alternative plans and specifications, or methods, classes or kinds of construction, or classes and kinds of material to be thereafter determined by the legislative body.

#### Section 48-577. Plans; estimate of cost; limitation on assessment

Before passing the resolution of intention, preliminary plans that show the location and the type and character of the proposed improvements and estimates of the cost and expenses of the proposed improvements shall be prepared and filed with the clerk. The assessment for any lot shall not exceed its proportion of the estimate.

#### Section 48-578. Publication of resolution of intention; posting notice of resolution

The resolution of intention shall be published in successive issues five times in a daily newspaper, or two times in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper, published and of general circulation in the municipality. The superintendent of streets shall also cause to be conspicuously posted along the line of the proposed improvement, at not more than three hundred feet apart, notices of the passage of the resolution. The notice shall be headed "Notice of proposed improvement" in letters at least one inch in height, and shall state the fact of the passage of the resolution of intention, and briefly describe the improvement proposed.

#### Section 48-579. Protest against proposed improvement; protest as bar to improvement proceedings; objection to extent of assessment district

A. The owners of a majority of the frontage of the property fronting on the proposed improvement, or, when the cost of the improvement has been made chargeable upon a district, the owners of a majority of the frontage of property contained within the limits of the assessment district, may make a written protest against the improvement within fifteen days after the date of the last publication of the resolution of intention, or within fifteen days after the completion of the posting of notices by the superintendent of streets if such date is subsequent to the day of the last publication.

B. The protest shall show a description of the property and the amount of the frontage owned by each signer together with his post office address, and shall be filed with the clerk who shall endorse thereon the date of delivery to him, and the protests so delivered and endorsed, if sufficient, shall be a bar to any further proceedings in making the improvement for six months from the date the protest is filed, unless the owners of one half or more of the frontage as aforesaid shall meanwhile petition for the work to be done. No portion of the improvement included in any proceeding barred by the protest shall be included within a new proceeding within six months from filing the protest, unless the owners of one half or more of the frontage of property fronting upon such portion petition for the work to be included in the new proceeding.

C. When the cost of the improvement has been made chargeable upon a district, objections to the extent of the district to be assessed to pay the expenses of the improvement may be made by an owner in the assessment district within the time provided for the filing of protests against the work. The objections shall show the amount of frontage owned by each signer, and his post office address.

D. When an objection to the extent of the proposed assessment district has been filed, the governing body of the municipality shall fix a time for hearing the objection, and the clerk shall notify the objectors by mail at the address given by each objector of the date of the hearing at least ten days prior to the hearing.

E. At the hearing, which may be adjourned, the governing body shall hear and pass upon the objections, and its decision shall be final and conclusive. It may modify the extent of the proposed assessment district, in which event a new resolution of intention shall be passed containing a description of the modified district, which shall be published, and notices thereof posted as required of an original resolution of intention.

#### Section 48-580. Procedure for making and hearing protests and objections

A. In determining protests and objections, the governing body shall be guided by these rules:

1. Each paper containing signatures shall have attached thereto the affidavit of an owner to be assessed, stating that each signature was affixed in his presence and is the signer's genuine signature.

2. The protest or objection shall be counted only for the property described as belonging to the signer, and a signature without the description shall not be counted.

3. The signature of one cotenant, or, if community property, the signature of either spouse, is sufficient for a protest if no objection to the signature is made by the other cotenant or spouse. If the signature is so protested, the protest shall be counted only to the extent of the signer's interest in the property.

4. A protest or objection signed by a guardian, executor, administrator or trustee is valid without an order of court therefor.

5. A protest or objection by a person in possession under contract of purchase is valid.

6. When several persons have a claim to or an interest in property, the signature of any of them is sufficient unless questioned by another having such claim or interest, whereupon the wishes of the person legally entitled to possession of the property at the date of the protest shall control.

7. A protest or objection signed by an agent or attorney in fact shall be disregarded unless the authority of the agent has been recorded with the county recorder, or written or telegraphic authority is attached to the protest or objection before expiration of the time for filing the protest or objection.

8. A signature may be withdrawn from a protest or objection by filing the withdrawal with the clerk in his office at or before five o'clock p.m., of the last day set for filing protests.

9. An objection to the signature of a cotenant, spouse, claimant or person interested may be filed, and the authority of an agent or attorney in fact questioned, at any time before the governing body finally passes upon the sufficiency of the protest, but an agency or authority may not be revoked as to the signature after expiration of the protest period.

B. The governing body may fix a date for a hearing upon the sufficiency of a protest, which shall be within thirty days from the expiration of the protest period, and shall give notice of the hearing by publication twice in a daily, or once in a weekly or semiweekly paper published in the municipality or county, and by mailing the notice to each protestant at his address of record.

C. The notice shall require all persons signing the protest, their agents or attorneys, to appear and show cause why the protest should not be overruled.

D. Upon the hearing the governing body may disregard all signatures of which the right to sign does not appear upon the records of the county recorder, and which is not supported by evidence at the hearing.

#### Section 48-581. Resolution ordering improvement; notice; bids

A. When no protests against the work or no objections as to the extent of the proposed assessment district have been filed within the time specified, or when a protest is found by the governing body to be insufficient, or when the objections to the extent of the proposed district have been heard and denied, the governing body may order, by resolution, the proposed improvements described in the resolution of intention.

B. The resolution need not fully describe the improvement nor the extent of the assessment district, but may refer to the resolution of intention for the description.

C. On completion of the plans and specifications, the superintendent shall publish a notice of the passage of the resolution ordering the work, and inviting sealed bids for making the improvement therein ordered, twice in one or more daily newspapers or once in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper, published and circulated in the city or town, and shall post a copy of the notice for five days on or near the door of the meeting place of the governing body. The notice shall state the time within which proposals may be filed with the clerk, which shall not be less than ten days from the date of the first publication of the notice.

D. When in the resolution of intention the governing body has provided for alternative plans and specifications, the invitation for bids for making the improvement may require separate bids according to each of the several alternative plans and specifications.

E. The governing body may combine by resolution two or more improvement projects for which resolutions of intention have been approved in order to allow the construction of those improvements under one contract and to allow one series of improvement bonds.

#### Section 48-582. Assessment of public property

A. When a lot belonging to the United States, the state, a county, city, school district or any political subdivision or institution of the state or county, fronts upon the proposed work or improvement, or is included within the district declared by the governing body in its resolution of intention to be the district to be assessed to pay the costs and expenses thereof, the governing body shall, in the resolution of intention, declare whether or not such lot shall be omitted from the assessment thereafter to be made.

B. If the lot is omitted from the assessment, then the total expense of all work done shall be assessed on the remaining lots fronting on the work or improvement, or lying within the assessment district, without regard to the omitted lot.

C. If the governing body declares the lot included in the assessment, or if no declaration is made respecting the lot, then the municipality shall be liable for and shall pay such sum as thereafter may be assessed against the lot. The amount of the assessment levied against the lot may be included in any bonds issued for the improvement, and if so included, the assessments shall bear the same interest, and be payable by the municipality in installments, as assessments against property of private persons.

D. The municipality may contract with the state, or body to which the lot belongs, for payment to the municipality of the assessment and interest as it becomes due and payable, and the state, or such body, shall perform the contract.

#### Section 48-583. Payment of costs by city

A. The governing body may order in the resolution of intention that the whole or any part of the cost and expenses of any work shall be paid from the treasury of the municipality from such fund as it designates. When so ordered, the superintendent of streets, in making up the assessment, shall first deduct from the whole cost and expenses such part as has been ordered paid from the treasury, and assess the remainder of the costs and expenses proportionately upon the lots liable to be assessed for the work.

B. When the whole of the cost is to be paid out of the treasury, then no assessment shall be made and the whole amount shall be payable thirty days after the acceptance of the work by the street superintendent.

#### Section 48-584. Bids; bond; award of contract; entering into contract; liability on bond

A. Bids shall be submitted accompanied by a bond payable to the municipality for an amount not less than ten per cent of the aggregate bid. Alternative bids may be accompanied by one bond at least equal to ten per cent of the amount of the highest proposal submitted.

B. The governing body of the city or town shall, in open session, publicly declare the bids, and may reject any or all when deemed for the public good, and shall reject all bids other than the lowest and best bid of a responsible bidder. The governing body may award the contract for the work or improvement to the lowest and best responsible bidder at the price named in his bid, upon motion, noted in its minutes, and upon a majority vote of its members.

C. When the resolution of intention to make the improvement and the resolution ordering the work has provided for alternative plans and specifications, and the notice has invited separate bids in accordance with the alternative plans and specifications, the governing body shall not award the contract for the improvement until fifteen days after the bids have been opened, examined and declared. If within such period the owners of a majority of the frontage of property fronting on the proposed improvement, or, when the cost of the improvement has been made chargeable upon a district, the owners of a majority of the frontage of property contained within the limits of the assessment district, in writing require that the proposed improvement be constructed in accordance with any particular one of the alternative plans and specifications, then the governing body shall so determine and require, and shall award the contract to the lowest and best responsible bidder. If no such written requirement is filed, then the governing body shall determine which of the alternative plans and specifications shall be adopted, considering the cost and efficiency thereof, and shall award the contract accordingly.

D. Notice of the award of contract shall be published twice in a daily newspaper or once in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper, published and of general circulation in the city or town.

E. At any time within fifteen days from the date of the first publication, any person having an interest in a lot liable to assessment, claiming that any of the previous acts or proceedings relating to the improvements are irregular, illegal or faulty, may file with the clerk a written notice specifying in what respect the acts and proceedings are irregular, illegal or faulty, and all objections to any act or proceeding which are not made prior to the notice of award shall be waived, except as to matters directly affecting the authority of the governing body. If the governing body finds any objection well taken, it may abandon the proceedings, or correct or modify any portion thereof, and proceed as in the first instance.

F. Within twenty days after the date of the first publication, if no objections have been filed, the successful bidder shall enter into a contract to make the improvement according to his bid. If objections are filed but are rejected by the governing body, the contract shall be entered into within five days after receiving notice from the clerk of such rejection. If the bidder fails to enter into the contract within such period provided, then the governing body without further proceedings shall again advertise for bids as in the first instance, and the bidder shall be liable upon his bond accompanying the bid for all costs and damages incurred and sustained by reason of the failure to enter into the contract.

#### Section 48-585. Option of municipality to reject bids; municipality as contractor; limitation of assessment

The governing body may at any time within ten days after the time fixed for opening bids, by resolution adopted by a vote of two thirds of all its members, order that the proposed contract not be made, and that the municipality itself perform the work embraced therein, in accordance with the plans and specifications adopted for such work. If the order is made that the municipality perform the work, then the municipality shall become and shall be considered the contractor. The municipality shall not be permitted to assess an amount in excess of the amount proposed by the lowest responsible bidder, or, if no bids have been received, in excess of the amount of the estimate therefor.

#### Section 48-586. Form and execution of contract; liquidated damages; supervision of performance; delivery of assessment

A. The superintendent of streets shall make all written contracts and receive all bonds authorized by this article. The contracts shall specify a reasonable time for completion of the improvement.

B. The governing body may prescribe a form of contract not inconsistent with this article and fix a reasonable time for completion of the work, which may be extended from time to time by the superintendent with the consent of the governing body.

C. The governing body may prescribe in the form of the contract an amount, not as a forfeit or penalty but as liquidated damages, per calendar day to be paid by the contractor if the contractor fails to complete the work within the time fixed in the contract or as the time for completion of the work may have been extended by the superintendent with the consent of the governing body. Allowing the contractor to finish the work or any part of the work after the time fixed for its completion, or after the date to which the time fixed for its completion may have been extended, does not operate as a waiver by the governing body or the superintendent of any of their rights under the contract or subsections E and F of this section. Any liquidated damages received shall be used to decrease the amounts assessed. Any assessments that are affected by a decrease in the contract amount as a result of the imposition of liquidated damages may be adjusted pursuant to section 48-590, subsection F, except that where the municipality has contributed its funds to the construction of the improvements, the liquidated damages so received shall be prorated between the municipality and the properties assessed.

D. The work shall be done under the direction of the superintendent, but the governing body may prescribe rules and regulations relating to the supervision of the work. The superintendent may appoint a suitable person to take charge of and superintend the construction of an improvement who shall see that the contract is fulfilled. The governing body shall fix the compensation to be allowed such person.

E. If the work is not prosecuted with diligence, the governing body, after a hearing on notice served on the contractor and the contractor's bondsmen, may prescribe such terms and conditions as it deems proper before allowing the contractor to continue with the work.

F. If the governing body finds that the contractor is unable to continue with the work or to perform the work according to the contract, the governing body shall hold the contractor in default and make demand on the surety to act in accordance with the contract and terms and conditions of the performance bond. Should the surety fail to act within sixty days from written notice, the governing body may order that bids be received from other contractors to complete the work. After receiving bids, the governing body may award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder. If, after receiving the new bids, the cost of completion exceeds the monies or bonds available for payment, the governing body shall make a demand on the defaulting contractor's surety for payment of the differential within twenty days after the mailing of the notice.  If the surety is represented by an attorney-in-fact, the demand may be served on the attorney-in-fact or at the  surety's principal office within this state. If the surety has no attorney-in-fact and no principal office within this state, the demand shall be served on the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions. The demand may not exceed the penal sum of the performance bond. Monies collected from the surety shall be used to pay the added costs of the work. Any difference between the actual costs of the work and the amount assessed shall be advanced by the municipality, which shall use its contingency funds or any other available funds to make payments to the new contractor. The municipality shall reimburse itself from the amounts paid by the former contractor or the former contractor's surety or from assessments and bonds when funds become available. All additional costs of the work not received from the original contractor's surety shall ultimately be assessed against the benefitting parcels of property.

G. If the contractor is not to be paid pursuant to section 48-597, subsection G or section 48-618, subsection F, on completion of the work the contractor shall be entitled to the issuance and delivery of the assessment as provided in this article.

#### Section 48-587. Bonds required from contractor

The contractor shall, before executing the contract, file with the superintendent such bond or bonds as required under the provisions of title 34, chapter 2, article 2.

#### Section 48-588. Cost of publication

A. Before the contract is entered into, the bidder to whom the award was made shall advance to the superintendent of streets, for payment by him, the costs of publication of the notices, resolutions, orders and other expenses required under the proceedings provided for by this article.

B. If the work is abandoned by the municipality before letting the contract, the costs incurred previous to the abandonment shall be paid by the municipality.

#### Section 48-589. Diagrams of property affected; estimate of benefits; assessment; warrant

A. The engineer shall make duplicate diagrams of the property fronting upon the proposed work or improvement, or contained within the assessment district when the expenses of the proposed improvement are to be assessed upon a district. The diagrams shall show each separate lot, numbered consecutively, the approximate area in square feet of each lot, and the location of the lot in relation to the work proposed to be done.

B. When the diagrams have been approved by the governing body, and the clerk has certified that fact and the date thereof, the diagrams shall be delivered to the superintendent of streets.

C. At any time after bids have been received for the construction of the work or the municipality has entered into a contract to purchase an existing facility, the superintendent shall estimate on the lots fronting on the work when no district has been established, or, when a district has been established, upon each of the lots within the district, the benefits arising, or expected to arise, from the work. The superintendent shall thereupon make an assessment to cover the sum due for the work performed and specified in the bid of the person to whom the contract was awarded, including incidental expenses, and shall assess upon and against the lots the total amount of the costs and expenses of the work. In so doing the superintendent shall assess the total sum upon the several lots, each respectively in proportion to the benefits to be received by each lot.

D. When the work has not been declared by the resolution of intention to be of more than local or ordinary public benefit, and has not been made assessable upon a district, the lots liable to be assessed for the improvement shall be those fronting upon the street or streets improved, and those situated in the quarter blocks and irregular blocks adjoining and cornering upon the crossings, or where there is a termination in the two quarter blocks adjoining and cornering thereon, halfway to the next main street crossing and all the way to a boundary line of the municipality when no cross street intervenes.

E. The assessment shall cover the sum due for the work performed or to be performed as specified in the bid of the person to whom the contract may be awarded, and shall also include incidental expenses. The incidental expenses shall include the compensation of the city or town engineer for work done by him, the cost of printing, advertising and posting, the compensation of the person appointed by the superintendent to take charge of and superintend the work of constructing the improvements and the expenses of making the assessment, interest on the bonds for a period not longer than the expected period of construction and six months beyond and all legal and financial fees, expenses and costs incurred in drafting the proceedings and in the sale of the bonds. The amount of incidental expenses shall be settled and allowed by the superintendent upon verified itemized bills.  If deemed necessary by the governing board, a reserve fund and additional, similar funds may be established either with proceeds from the sale of the bonds and that will be covered by the assessment or by increasing the collections of the annual installments of principal, over and above the amounts required to pay maturing principal on the bonds.  The monies in those funds may be used only to cure deficits in the principal and interest funds or to pay interest and principal on the final maturity or maturities of the bonds.

F. The assessment shall briefly refer to the award of the contract or to the contract if it has then been executed and shall name the person to whom the contract has been awarded and such person's surety, and the amount to be paid therefor as stated in the winning bid or as finally computed by the engineer, if the assessment is not made until the work is completed, together with the incidental expenses, the amount of each assessment, the name of the owner of each lot, if known, and if unknown the word "unknown" shall be written opposite the number of the assessment, together with the amount assessed thereon. The superintendent of streets shall list the names of owners as shown on the most recently certified property tax assessment roll and any other person of whom the superintendent has personal knowledge that such other person may be the owner of the respective lot. The assessments upon the lots assessed shall be consecutively numbered, and the diagram shall be numbered to correspond with the numbers of the assessments.

G. There shall be attached to the assessment a warrant signed by the superintendent and countersigned by the mayor, which shall be substantially in the following form: "By virtue hereof, I (name of superintendent of streets), of the (name of municipality and county), and state of Arizona, by virtue of the authority vested in me as said superintendent of streets, do authorize and empower (name of contractor or the municipality, if the municipality elects to sell the bonds instead of delivering the bonds to the contractor), or the contractor's agents or assigns, to demand and receive the several assessments upon the assessment hereto attached, and this shall be the contractor's warrant for the same."

H. The warrant and assessment shall be recorded in the office of the superintendent not earlier than the date of execution of the construction contract and one diagram shall be there filed. When so recorded, the several amounts assessed shall be a first lien on the lots assessed subject only to the lien for general property taxes and prior special assessments for a period terminating on the date the assessment against the respective lot is paid in full, and such recording shall be notice to all persons interested of the contents of the record.

I. For a community facilities district and in compliance with section 48-721, subsection A, after adoption by the district board of a resolution that levies a special assessment on property in the district for a public infrastructure purpose pursuant to section 48-709, subsection A but before the issuance of special assessment bonds, the district may enter into a written agreement with a landowner as to the manner in which the assessment is to be allocated if the land is to be divided into more than one parcel.  Based on that agreement, the district may provide that the collection of installments of assessments be paid to that landowner for the costs of public infrastructure purposes on the same basis that payments would be made on bonds, until the district board determines, if ever, that bonds should be issued.  Until bonds are issued, assessments may bear interest at the rate specified by the district board in the written agreement.  Installments on assessments or principal that are paid to the landowner shall be credited against the costs of public infrastructure purposes, including incidental expenses as provided in the written agreement.

 

#### Section 48-590. Delivery of warrant and assessment to contractor; demand for payment; release of assessments; review of assessment

A. After the warrant and assessment are recorded, they shall be delivered to the contractor, or to the treasurer of the municipality if the municipality charges itself with the duty of making demands for the payment of the several assessments, together with one of the diagrams, and by virtue of the warrant, the contractor or treasurer, as the case may be, is authorized to demand and receive the amount of the several assessments.

B. The contractor or treasurer, as the case may be, shall call upon the person assessed, either in person or by use of the United States mail if the person can conveniently be found, and demand payment, and if paid shall give a receipt therefor. The receipt, when presented to the superintendent, shall be an order to the superintendent to release the assessment.

C. The contractor or treasurer shall promptly notify the superintendent of all payments made to the contractor or treasurer, whereupon the superintendent shall release assessments which have been fully paid. When the name of the owner of the lot is stated as "unknown" on the assessment, the contractor or treasurer shall demand payment of a person in possession. If someone is in possession, such demand may be made either by use of the United States mail, if a mailing address for the person in possession can be determined, or in person. If the premises are unoccupied or the person in possession cannot be found, such demand is unnecessary.

D. The warrant shall be returned to the superintendent within thirty days after its date with a "return" endorsed thereon, signed by the contractor or treasurer, as the case may be, verified upon oath stating the nature and character of the demand, and whether any assessments remain unpaid in whole or in part, and the amount thereof. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, the verified statement of the person making the return is conclusive proof that the demand for payment was made upon each owner, person in possession or each parcel of property as required by this section. The superintendent shall record the return so made in the margin of the record of the warrant and assessment. After return of the assessment and warrant all amounts remaining due shall draw interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum until paid or, upon the issuance of bonds, at the rate specified in the bonds payable for the semiannual period specified in the bonds notwithstanding the fact that the installments of assessments may be due at dates earlier than installments of interest are payable on the bonds.

E. After completion of the work, the superintendent shall notify the governing body of such fact, and the board shall fix a time when it will hear and pass upon the assessment and the proceedings theretofore had and taken, which shall not be less than twenty days thereafter. The governing body shall cause notice of the hearing to be given by publication for five days in a daily newspaper published and circulated in the municipality, or two times in a semiweekly or weekly newspaper so published, and the street superintendent shall cause notices of the time and place of the hearing to be mailed by first class mail, at least twenty days before the hearing date, to all persons owning real property affected by the assessments as the names and addresses appear on the last certified property tax roll. If no address appears for any person on the last certified tax roll, then no notice need be mailed to such person. The street superintendent shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite therein that the persons to whom notices were mailed constitute all persons whose names and addresses appear upon the tax roll as owning property within the particular improvement area, which affidavit shall be conclusive proof that notice was mailed each person to whom notice is required to be mailed. Failure to receive notice shall not constitute any jurisdictional defect invalidating any proceeding or assessment if notice has been sent pursuant to this section.

F. If the assessment is dated before the work has been completed, the superintendent shall file with the clerk, at or prior to the hearing, a recapitulated assessment based on the actual quantities determined by the engineer to have been constructed or installed, or the actual cost of the acquisition, as the case may be, together with the known incidental expenses expended to that date and the itemized estimated incidental expenses remaining to be expended. The engineer need not recompute each individual assessment but shall determine the amount of the increase or decrease to be assessed and shall file a supplemental statement with the clerk setting forth the ratio of the differential between the contractor's bid and the recapitulated amount and ordering that each assessment be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by such ratio. If the total assessment is decreased, the treasurer shall return to the owner, if the owner can be located, that portion of each assessment previously paid in cash which represents an excess payment.

G. The owners, contractor and all other persons directly interested in the work or in the assessment, who have any objection to the legality of the assessment or to any of the previous proceedings connected therewith, or who claim that the work has not been performed according to the contract, may, prior to the time fixed for the hearing, file a written notice briefly specifying the grounds of their objections. At the time fixed for the hearing or at any time not later than ten days thereafter to which the hearing may be postponed, the governing body shall hear and pass upon the objections. The decision of the governing body shall be final and conclusive upon all persons entitled to object as to all errors, informalities and irregularities which the governing body might have remedied or avoided at any time during the progress of the proceedings.

H. If the governing body finds that the contract has not been fully performed, it shall withhold all amounts or bonds owed and not then paid, or delivered, to the contractor until such time as in its opinion the contract is fully performed. If the governing body finds that the amount or bonds left on hand to be paid to the contractor is not sufficient to pay the costs necessary to complete the work and that the contractor is not likely to complete the work according to the contract, the governing body may summon the contractor and contractor's surety for a hearing pursuant to section 48-586. The governing body may modify the amounts of the several assessments after hearing, and may order that the assessment be recomputed if it finds that the benefits to any lots do not equal the amount of such lot's respective assessment. When recomputing the assessment, the superintendent of streets shall again levy the assessments according to the benefits derived, as instructed by the governing body, notwithstanding the fact that the reduction of any assessment may cause a corresponding increase in other assessments.

#### Section 48-591. Action against property owner to collect assessment

A. At any time after thirty-five days from the date of the warrant, or, if any objection filed with the governing body as provided in section 48-590 is denied, at any time after five days from its decision, the contractor may sue the owner of the lot assessed and recover the amount of an assessment remaining unpaid with interest thereon at the rate of eight per cent per annum until paid, and to foreclose the lien of the assessment.

B. Where personal demand has been made, and the owner has refused to pay the assessment so demanded, the plaintiff may recover a reasonable attorney's fee.

C. Only one action shall be commenced for the foreclosure of liens arising under a single proceeding against the same defendant.

D. The warrant, assessment and diagram, with the affidavit of demand and nonpayment, shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity and correctness of the assessment and of the prior proceedings and acts of the superintendent and governing body, upon which the warrant, assessment and diagram are based, and like evidence of the right of plaintiff to recover.

#### Section 48-592. Invalidity of liens or bonds; extent of validity; means to secure interest of persons damaged

A. If the lien of an assessment or reassessment, or of a bond issued to represent the amount assessed on any lot is held invalid by a court because a portion of the improvement ordered was without the power of the governing body to order, or was not properly embraced within the contract for the work, or in the assessment made to cover the expenses, the owner of the warrant or the holder of the bond is entitled to a judgment determining what portion of the assessment was legal. There shall thereafter be issued to him by the superintendent within sixty days, and in accordance with the directions of the judgment, a new assessment for an amount which the court finds was the reasonable value of the portion of the improvement legally authorized by the proceedings, which amount shall be reassessed upon the property in the same manner and with like effect as provided for issuing the original assessment, and may be enforced as an original assessment. The holder of bonds representing the original assessment shall be entitled to new bonds on each lot representing the amount of the reassessment.

B. If the lien of an assessment, or of a bond issued therefor, is held invalid by a court for any cause arising subsequent to the time the authority of the governing body attaches to order the work, or when the lien is defeated or held invalid for any cause, and it also appears that the owner of the property, holding it at the time the notice of the award of contract was published, had personal knowledge of the intention to order award of the contract, and has not filed a protest against the improvement or a notice of his objection to the award of contract, the owner of the assessment or bond may recover from the owner of the lot covered by the assessment such sum as the court shall find the lot to have been actually benefited by the improvement, not exceeding the amount which would have been properly assessable against the lot.

#### Section 48-593. Proportionate assessment; collection or issuance of bonds

The governing body may, upon completion of any portion of the improvement for which the contract price equals twenty thousand dollars or more, order the superintendent to make an assessment for the proportionate part of the contract completed, and thereon proceedings and rights of collection of such proportionate amount shall be had as provided by this article. If the resolution of intention for the improvement provides for the issuance of improvement bonds, they shall be issued and delivered to the contractor for the proportionate amount of the contract price so assessed.

#### Section 48-594. Correction of assessment; reallocation of assessment

A. After an assessment has been approved by the governing body, the contractor and all persons having an interest in any lot assessed may request the governing body, by a duly acknowledged written instrument, to modify or correct an assessment.  The governing body may order such modification or correction to be made, and direct the superintendent to note the modification or correction on his record of the assessment, together with the date it is made. The modification or correction under this subsection shall not affect the rights of persons under the assessment who have not joined in the request.

B. The governing body may reallocate all or part of an assessment as follows:

1. The superintendent shall prepare a list of all the assessments to be reallocated, including:

(a) The assessment number, legal description and amount assessed on each affected parcel before the reallocation.

(b) The assessment number, legal description and name and address of the owner as shown on the most recent tax roll.

(c) The amount to be assessed on each parcel after reallocation.

2. The superintendent shall prepare an amendment to the assessment diagram reflecting the new assessment numbers and parcel boundaries.

3. The superintendent shall cause a notice to be mailed to each owner of an affected parcel showing the proposed reallocation and stating that the owner may file a written objection to the reallocation within twenty days after the notice was mailed.

4. If no objections are received within twenty days after the notice is mailed, the governing body may approve the proposed reallocation.  If timely objections are received, the governing body shall hold a hearing on the objections.  The governing body shall mail notice of the hearing to all affected owners at least ten days before the hearing.  At the hearing the objecting parties shall present evidence supporting their objections.  After the hearing the governing body shall rule on all objections received and may approve the proposed reallocation or may make changes to the reallocation as the governing body considers necessary and approve the reallocation as changed.  The governing body shall also approve the amendment to the assessment diagram as submitted or with changes the governing body considers to be necessary.

5. After the governing body’s decision, the superintendent shall record the reallocated assessment and amended assessment diagram in the superintendent’s office.

6. The amount assessed immediately after the reallocation shall be equal to the amount assessed immediately before the reallocation.

7. As a condition to reallocation, the governing body may require the affected property owners to pay the costs of reallocation, including engineering and legal costs, or may include the costs in the amount assessed against the affected parcels.  The costs are due and payable as part of the next installment of the assessment.

#### Section 48-595. Issuance of improvement bonds; fund for payment of bonds

A. The governing body may determine that improvement bonds be issued to represent the cost and expense of the work or improvement constructed. The bonds shall be issued in the name of the municipality but shall be made payable only from the special fund collected by the municipality from special assessments levied and assessed upon the lots fronting upon the street improved and those situated in the quarter block and irregular blocks adjoining and cornering upon the crossings, or where there is a termination in the two quarter blocks adjoining and cornering upon them halfway to the next main street crossing, and all the way to a boundary line of the municipality when no cross street intervenes, or, if an assessment district has been created by the resolution of intention for the work, upon the lots included within the limits of the assessment district.

B. All sums collected from the special assessments shall be placed in the special fund and shall be used for no other purpose than payment of the principal and interest of the bonds.

#### Section 48-596. Description of improvement bonds in resolution and notices

A. When the governing body determines that improvement bonds be issued, it shall so declare in the resolution of intention for the work and shall specify the maximum rate of interest which they shall bear. A like description of the bonds shall be inserted in all notices of the proceedings required to be published or posted, and a notice that the bonds will be paid from a special fund collected in not to exceed twenty-five annual installments from the assessments of twenty-five dollars or over remaining unpaid at the date of the bonds. A like description of the bonds shall be included in the warrant.

B. All other proceedings for the work up to and including the approval of the assessment by the governing body, and including delivery of the assessment to the contractor or treasurer, demand of payment of the several assessments and the return and record thereof, shall be in all respects as provided in this article.

#### Section 48-597. List of unpaid assessments; issuance of bonds; denominations; due date

A. After the return of the warrant, and after recording the return, the superintendent shall make and certify to the clerk a complete list of all assessments unpaid, which amount to twenty-five dollars or over, upon any assessment.

B. If any person before certification of the list to the clerk presents to the superintendent an affidavit that the person owns a lot in the list, accompanied by the certificate of a searcher of records that the person is the owner of record, and notifies the superintendent in writing that the person desires no bond to be issued for the assessment upon the lot, then the assessment shall not be included in the list, and shall remain collectible as provided by this article.  Omission to file the notice shall bar any defense against the bonds except the defense that the governing body did not have authority to issue the bonds.

C. The clerk shall present the list to the governing body at its next meeting after the return has been recorded.  At any time after awarding a contract for construction or acquisition, the governing body may, by resolution, direct improvement bonds to be issued in an amount which shall not exceed the amount of unpaid assessments exceeding twenty-five dollars as may be shown on the certified list. The resolution shall prescribe the maximum number and denomination of the bonds, and the times when payable, which shall be so fixed that an approximately equal amount of principal shall be paid each year or any approximately equal aggregate amount of principal and interest shall be paid each year until the whole amount is paid.  The bonds shall mature in a period which shall not exceed twenty-five years and three months from the date of the bonds. The denominations of the bonds shall be fixed by the governing body.  The governing body may provide in the form of bond for redemption prior to maturity upon the giving of such notice as the governing body determines to be reasonable and for the payment of a premium at redemption if the governing body determines the premium to be advisable.  The resolution shall also fix the place, if any, other than the office of the treasurer, at which the bonds and the interest shall be payable.

D. The bonds shall be issued as of the date determined by the governing body, and shall bear interest from such date at the rates specified in the resolution, payable semiannually beginning on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, occurring no earlier than ninety days after the later of the date of the bond or the expected completion of the work, and shall be for the interest accrued at that time.

E. The due date of all bonds shall be January 1 in the years in which they respectively become due.

F. The city shall have the option to sell the bonds at public or private sale or by an on-line bidding process, at a price not below par and accrued interest to the date of payment, and at an interest rate not in excess of the maximum rate set in the resolution of intention.  In the event the bonds are not sold by the city they shall be delivered to the contractor for the amount of the assessments remaining unpaid and the bonds shall bear interest at the maximum interest rate set forth in the resolution or ordinance of intention.

G. If the bonds are sold before the work or acquisition is completed, the proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the treasurer and to be used for payment of incidental expenses and payments for construction or acquisition.  Proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be used for the acquisition mentioned in the resolution of intention or to make semimonthly or monthly payments to the contractor upon a basis of ninety per cent of the value of the work actually performed as estimated by the superintendent or engineer employed for such purposes to and including the fifteenth or last day of each calendar month. The balance shall be paid after the governing body has approved the assessment after the hearing.  Pending use of the bond proceeds, the treasurer may invest the proceeds in any investments for which sinking funds of this state may be invested.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if bond anticipation notes have been issued, the bond proceeds, or so much as is necessary, shall be used to redeem such notes.

H. The city and the county treasurer for the county in which the city is located may enter into an agreement for the county treasurer to collect the assessments in the manner and by the officers provided by law for the collection and enforcement of general taxes.  The city and the county treasurer may provide by agreement for the payment of the county treasurer's collection expenses that are directly related to the levy of the assessment and, if so provided, the levy of the assessment may include an amount for compensation of the county treasurer's expenses directly related to the collection of the assessment.  Section 11-496 applies to the compensation received by the county treasurer pursuant to the agreement.

 

#### Section 48-598. Form of bonds

A. The bonds shall be signed by the mayor, attested by the clerk and sealed with the corporate seal of the city or town, and the interest coupons shall bear the facsimile signature of the mayor and clerk.

B. The bonds shall be substantially in the following form: "City (or town) of . . . . . . . . . improvement bond. Know all men by these presents: That the city (or town) of . . . . . . . . . , Arizona, a duly organized municipal corporation, promises to pay as hereinafter stated to the bearer hereof, on the . . . . day of . . . . . . . . ., the sum of . . . . . . . . . dollars, together with interest on said sum, at the rate of . . . . per cent per annum, payable semiannually on the first days of January and July of each year, as evidenced by and upon the presentation and surrender of the interest coupons hereto attached as they severally become due. Both principal and interest are payable at the office of the city (or town) of . . . . . . . or at . . . . . . . , at the option of the holder. This bond is issued in pursuance of law, and is one of a series of . . . . . . . . bonds of like tenor and date for the total sum of . . . . . . . . . . dollars issued for that certain improvement in said municipality consisting of (briefly describing improvement), initiated by resolution no. . . . . . of (name of municipality), and is payable only out of the special fund to be collected from special assessments imposed on the lots, or parcels of land fronting on or benefited by said improvement. Said special fund is set apart by law for the payment of said bonds, and can be used for no other purpose. It is hereby certified and declared that the improvement for which this series of bonds is issued is authorized by law, that all the acts, conditions and things required to be done, precedent to and in the issuing of this series of bonds, have been done and performed in regular and due form as required by the laws of the state of Arizona, the charter of (name of municipality), and all ordinances and resolutions thereof, that the special assessments out of which said bonds are to be paid are first liens on the property assessed, subject only to the lien for general taxes and prior special assessments, and any bona fide purchaser for value of this bond has the right to rely on the recitals herein contained. For the assessment or reassessment, collection and payment of said special assessments, the full faith and diligence of said municipality are hereby irrevocably pledged."

#### Section 48-599. Certification of unpaid assessments; payments by installment; interest; payments in advance

A. The superintendent, at the time he certifies the list of assessments unpaid to the clerk, shall write the word "certified" on the record of the assessment opposite each assessment included in the list, and thereupon all assessments of twenty-five dollars or over shall cease to be payable in cash except as provided in subsection F of this section and shall thereafter be payable only in equal annual installments on December 1, in each year preceding January 1 on which the bonds become due. The governing body may provide a plan whereby the annual installment may be collected in partial payments prior to the time the installment is due, and the lien of each assessment on the property assessed shall continue and remain in full force and effect for two years after the last installment on the assessment becomes due, or until the assessment is fully paid.

B. An uncollected installment shall be added to the succeeding installment and, together with interest and penalties, shall be payable therewith.

C. The number of installments in which the assessment is payable shall correspond to the number of years in which there are bonds to be paid, but the total number of installments shall not exceed twenty-five.

D. All assessments of twenty-five dollars or more not paid before the certification of assessments unpaid to the clerk shall bear interest from the date of the warrant at the same rate as that specified for the bonds in the resolution of intention. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, the interest shall be payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, immediately before the interest becomes due on the bonds, but the governing body may provide a plan whereby the interest may be collected in partial payments prior to the date it becomes due.

E. The governing body may provide for receiving payment of the installments of the assessment before they become due, and using the proceeds thereof in redeeming such bonds as may be presented for redemption by the owners thereof, or for investing the proceeds in improvement bonds for other work or other satisfactory investment, but no investment of such funds shall be made so as to prejudice the prompt payment of the bonds on the date they become due.

F. Any loan repayment agreement between the municipality and the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona pursuant to section 48-622 may be secured by unpaid assessments certified in the manner prescribed by section 48-597. The loan repayment agreement may provide for different due dates for annual installments of principal, different interest payment date, different dates of delinquency and different dates for holding the sales pursuant to sections 48-601, 48-602 and 48-603. The loan repayment agreement may also provide for mailed notice to all owners in lieu of the publication requirements prescribed by section 48-600 and 48-601.

#### Section 48-600. Collection of assessment installments; notice; delinquent installments

A. All assessments not certified to the clerk shall remain collectable by the contractor as provided by this article, but the superintendent shall promptly collect all installments of principal and interest on the assessments so certified to the clerk. The superintendent shall, thirty days before any installment of principal or interest becomes due, give notice by mail to every person interested who has filed his name and address with the superintendent, and by publication in not smaller than eighteen point type at least two times in a daily newspaper published and circulated in the municipality, or at least two successive insertions in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper so published and circulated.

B. The notice shall serve for all assessments in the municipality becoming due on the date specified therein, and shall be substantially in the following form: "Notice of special assessments due on improvements. All persons owning property heretofore assessed for improvements, will take notice that an installment of _______________ becomes due and payable on or before the ______ day of _____________ 19____ and if not so paid on or before said date the same will become delinquent and five per cent penalty will be added to the amount thereof."

C. The governing body may publish a more detailed notice, in smaller type, but the heading of the notice shall not be smaller type than eighteen point. The first publication of notice shall be at least thirty days before the installment is payable. The method of publication of notice provided for in this section shall apply to and govern all bonds and assessments heretofore issued and levied, and all notices of special assessments due on improvements shall be given and published in accordance herewith.

D. When an installment is paid, the superintendent shall note in his record the date of the payment, the name of the person by or for whom it is paid and shall, if requested, give receipt therefor.

E. On the day succeeding the date on which the installment becomes due all installments unpaid shall become delinquent, and the superintendent shall certify such fact on his records and mark each installment delinquent and add five per cent to the amount of each installment.

#### Section 48-601. List of delinquent installments; publication of notice; sale of delinquent property

A. The superintendent shall, within twenty days from the date of the delinquency, begin the publication of the list of the assessments on which any installment is delinquent. The list shall contain a description of each parcel of property, and opposite each description the name of the owner as stated in the assessment, or, if no name is stated in the assessment, the word "unknown," and the amount of the installment delinquent, together with penalty and costs due, including the cost of advertising.

B. The superintendent shall append to and publish with the list, a notice that unless each delinquent installment, together with the penalty and costs thereon, is paid, the whole amount of the assessment will be declared due by him, and the property upon which the assessment is a lien will be sold at public auction at a time and place to be specified in the notice. The publication shall be published and circulated in the municipality for a period of ten days in a daily newspaper, or for two weeks in a weekly newspaper so published and circulated. If published in a daily newspaper, publication shall be made in two issues of the paper, and eight days shall intervene between the first and the last publication.

C. Before the date fixed for the sale or before the date to which the sale has been postponed, the superintendent shall obtain a record search that shows the names and addresses of record of all lien claimants on, and other persons with an interest in, all lots or parcels on which an installment of the assessment is delinquent.  The cost of a record search may be added to the assessment and is deemed to be a portion of the delinquent installment.

D. At least ten days before the sale date or the date to which the sale has been postponed, the superintendent shall serve by first class mail a notice of the date and place of the sale or postponed sale to the owner and to each of the lien claimants and other persons with an interest as shown by the search of records.  The notice shall state the date of the sale, the amount of the delinquent installments including penalties, costs of advertisement and costs of the record search, shall state either that the whole amount of the assessment and costs and penalties or, if the municipality has provided for the sale of the amount of the delinquent assessment, that the amount then delinquent and costs and penalties are due at the time of the sale and shall state that, unless redeemed within the time allowed by law, a superintendent's deed will be delivered to the purchaser and the superintendent's deed shall convey title to the lands described therein free and clear of all interests and liens, except for the lien for general property taxes and prior special assessments.

E. A final sale may not be held unless the superintendent has provided notice by mail as prescribed by this section to all lien claimants discovered in the search of records.  The mailing may occur either before the date originally set for the sale or before the date of any postponed sale, and only one mailing and one record search is required.

F. The time of sale shall not be less than five days after the last publication, and the place of sale shall be in or in front of the office of the superintendent, or in or in front of the usual place of meeting of the governing body of the municipality. The sale may be postponed.

#### Section 48-602. Payment after delinquency and before sale

At any time prior to the sale of any lot assessed, any person may pay the delinquent installment on the lot together with the penalty and costs then due, including the cost of advertising, whereupon the superintendent shall note on his records the date of payment, the name of the person by or for whom it is paid, and the amount paid.

#### Section 48-603. Sale procedure; municipality as purchaser; disposition of property by municipality

A. On the day fixed for the sale, the superintendent shall, at 10:00 a.m., or at any time thereafter to which the sale may be adjourned, begin the sale of the property advertised, commencing at the head of the list and continuing in the numerical order of lots, until all are sold. The superintendent may postpone or continue the sale from day to day until all the property is sold. Each lot separately assessed shall be offered for sale separately. The sale shall be for the entire assessment including the delinquent installments, and the person who will take the least quantity of land and then and there pay the amount of the assessment, penalty and costs due, including fifty cents to the superintendent for a certificate of sale, shall become the purchaser.

B. The municipality may provide by ordinance that if there is no purchaser other than the municipality who will pay the entire amount of the assessment, penalty and costs, including fifty cents to the superintendent for a certificate of sale, the superintendent shall sell the lot or portion of the lot to the person who will take the least quantity of land and then and there pay the amount of the assessment then delinquent, including interest, penalty and costs due, and fifty cents to the superintendent for a certificate of sale, and deed shall issue to the purchaser, subject to redemption, as provided by this article. The municipality may also provide by ordinance that the lien on the entire lot, piece or parcel of land assessed shall continue to be in effect for the amount of the assessment or portion thereof, including interest, penalties and costs, thereafter to become due, and the land may again be sold should the assessment again become delinquent. When so provided by ordinance such fact shall be stated in the notice of sale and the superintendent shall comply with the provisions.

C. If there is no purchaser for any lot offered for sale, it shall be struck off to the municipality as the purchaser, and the governing body shall appropriate first from any reserve and any additional, similar fund and then from the general fund of the treasury the amount bid for such purpose, and shall order the treasurer to place the amount in a special fund for such improvement. The governing body, however, may direct the treasurer to pay into the special fund only the sum required to pay the installment then due or to become due upon the bonds issued for the assessment, and thereupon the municipality shall become obligated to pay first from any reserve and any additional, similar fund and then from the general fund the succeeding installments and interest on the bonds, as are payable by the assessments on the lot. Thereafter the lien of the assessment shall not be extinguished for nonpayment of general taxes or prior special assessments, and the annual installments of principal and interest of the assessment shall constitute a first lien on the respective lot, piece or parcel of land, coequal with the lien for general taxes. If the lien has not been extinguished prior to the property being stricken off to the state, such lien shall extinguish upon sale of the property pursuant to title 42, chapter 18, article 7 and the municipality shall share pro rata in the proceeds of such sale to the extent of the delinquent assessments.

D. The municipality may sell any lot so purchased after the expiration of the time for redemption at public or private sale. All sums received by the municipality from redemption of property purchased by it and from sale by it of property so purchased, less the amount paid into the special fund first from any reserve and any additional, similar fund and then from the general fund, shall be paid into the special fund for the payment of the bonds until the special fund is sufficient to pay all outstanding bonds. If the municipality has provided that the installment of principal and interest may be paid in partial payments prior to the time each of the installments becomes due, and the owner of the property against which the installment of principal and interest has become delinquent has paid in to the superintendent partial payments on the installments, the owner of the property advertised for sale shall have the right to pay the balance due on the annual installments of principal and interest plus penalties and costs, and no sale shall be held on the parcel of land.

E. The superintendent shall record the date of the payment and mark the installment of principal or interest paid. In the event the owner does not pay the balance due on the installment of principal or interest, and the property is sold for the full amount of the assessment, the superintendent shall refund to the owner all money received from the owner by way of partial payments.

 

#### Section 48-604. Certificate of sale; lien

A. After making the sale, the superintendent shall execute, in duplicate, a certificate of sale stating the description of the property sold, the name of the owner thereof as given on the record of the assessment, that the property was sold for a delinquent assessment, specifying the improvement for which the assessment was made, the amount for which the property was sold, the date of sale, the name of the purchaser, and the time when the purchaser will be entitled to a deed. The superintendent shall file one copy of the certificate in his office, and deliver the other to the purchaser, or if the municipality is the purchaser, to the clerk, who shall file it in his office.

B. On filing the copy of the certificate in the office of the superintendent, the lien of the assessment shall vest in the purchaser, and is only divested by a redemption of the property, as provided in this article.

C. The superintendent shall also enter on the record of the assessment, opposite the description of each lot offered for sale, a description of the part thereof sold, the amount for which it was sold, the date of sale, and the name of the purchaser.

#### Section 48-605. Redemption

A. Redemption may be made by any party having an interest in the lot at any time before the execution and delivery of a deed therefor by paying to the superintendent the amount for which the property was sold and five per cent thereon if paid within three months from the date of sale, ten per cent if paid within six months, twelve per cent if paid within nine months, fifteen per cent if paid within twelve months, or twenty per cent if paid after twelve months.

B. When redemption is made, the superintendent shall note that fact on the duplicate certificate of sale in his office and deposit the amount paid with the treasurer, who shall credit the purchaser named in the certificate of sale with the amount, and pay the amount to such purchaser or his assignee, upon the surrender of the certificate of sale.

C. When the municipality is the purchaser, the treasurer shall notify the clerk of the redemption, and the clerk shall thereupon cancel the certificate of sale in his office.

#### Section 48-606. Deed to purchaser; notice to owner; redemption after notice; effect of deed

A. After the expiration of twelve months from the date of sale, the superintendent shall execute to the purchaser, or his assignee, on his application, if he has fully complied with this section, a deed to the property sold in which shall be recited substantially the matters contained in the certificate, any assignment thereof, and that no person has redeemed the property. The superintendent shall receive from the applicant for a deed, one dollar for making the deed, unless the municipality is the purchaser.

B.

The superintendent shall promptly pay to the treasurer all monies collected by him from sales. The treasurer, on receipt thereof, shall place the monies in the special fund hereby created for the payments of the bonds issued for the improvement.

#### Section 48-608. Ordinance for collection of assessments by taxation

A. The governing body may by ordinance passed before or after issuance of the bonds, provide that the assessments for the payment of the bonds shall be collectable in the manner and by the officers provided by law or by the charter of the municipality for the collection and enforcement of the general taxes levied by the municipality. The ordinance shall be general in terms and shall apply to assessments for all improvement bonds issued whether issued before or after passage of the ordinance.

B. The time for payment of the respective installments of principal and interest under the ordinance shall be the last regular date for the payment of general taxes of the municipality before the date at which the installment of principal or interest would become delinquent, and the delinquency and the penalties incurred for delinquency and the method of collection under the ordinance shall be the same as for general taxes of the municipality.

C. The governing body adopting such method of collection may at any time repeal the ordinance providing therefor, and upon repeal the provisions for the collection of the assessments provided in this article shall again become effective.

D. When any installment of an assessment is not collected when due, it may be added to and collected with any succeeding installment.

E. Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the governing body, by ordinance or resolution, may provide that assessments securing a loan repayment agreement authorized by section 48-622, be collected by taxation.

F. If the municipality's ad valorem taxes are collected by the county or if the municipality has no ad valorem taxes, assessments collected by taxation as provided in this section shall be collected and enforced in the same manner as state and county ad valorem taxes are collected and enforced, and the collection of all such assessments shall be added to, and become a part of, tax rolls and tax bills issued by the county treasurer.

G. Neither the county nor the county treasurer shall charge the municipality for collection of such assessments.

#### Section 48-609. Deficiency in collections

If there is a deficiency in the funds collected from the special assessments by reason of the inadequacy of the method of collection adopted by the municipality under section 48-608, the municipality shall make good the deficiency, reimbursing itself from the funds collected from the installments when they are received. If such method has not been adopted and the deficiency has not been funded by monies from a reserve, the municipality may, but is not so obligated, make good the deficiency by a temporary loan first from any reserve and any additional, similar fund and then from the general fund.

 

#### Section 48-609.01. Special provisions pertaining to loan agreements

A. Each municipality that has entered into, or enters into, a loan agreement with the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona pursuant to section 48-622, if the municipality adopts an ordinance for collection of assessments by taxation pursuant to section 48-608, shall remain contingently liable for all amounts to be paid pursuant to the loan agreement.

B. To implement contingent liability the municipality, no later than ten days before it is required to pay any amounts under a loan agreement from special assessments, shall transfer from its general fund to the county treasurer an amount equal to any then due and unpaid special assessments securing a loan agreement being collected pursuant to section 48-608. The municipality shall determine if the special assessments are delinquent. If, due to the timing of collections made pursuant to section 48-608, the municipality is unable to pay any amounts due on a loan agreement, the municipality shall advance the amounts from its general fund and reimburse itself from later special assessment collections that are not needed to make payments on the loan agreement.

C. The payment by the municipality to the county treasurer pursuant to subsection B of this section shall not satisfy the amount of taxes due but shall operate as an assignment of all rights to taxes collected thereafter, including penalties and interest, to the municipality, and the taxes shall remain subject to collection in the same manner as all other general taxes. On the payment of taxes or sale of the property assessed, the county treasurer shall return the portion paid by the municipality, plus a pro rata share of all penalties and interest to reimburse amounts paid from the municipality's general fund.

D. The municipality may also enforce all delinquent assessments securing a loan agreement through the summary sale provisions of title 35, chapter 3, article 4.1 and may refund the special assessments in the manner provided in title 35, chapter 3, article 4.

#### Section 48-610. Procedure when assessment declared void

A. When the assessment on a lot levied for the improvement, or part thereof, or the entire assessment, is adjudged void for any reason, the governing body shall cause to be levied and assessed upon the lot on which the assessment has been held void, or upon all the lots included within the limits assessed for the work, a new assessment sufficient to provide for the payment of principal and interest on all bonds then unpaid. The reassessment shall be made as nearly as practicable in the same manner, and with like effect, as the original assessment.

B. In case of partial deficit the governing body may pay the deficit from the general fund.

E. An improvement district formed under provisions of this section shall not be authorized to issue improvement bonds, and no assessment for district purposes against the property within such district shall exceed one dollar twenty cents per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation thereof in any tax year.

F. No improvement district formed under provisions of this section shall be authorized to engage in any activity other than the leasing of off-street parking sites and the improvement, operation and maintenance of same. If the municipality is willing to participate in the cost of leasing, improving, operating or maintaining the off-street parking sites in such improvement districts, the governing body may, by resolution, summarily order such participation.

G. The formation of an improvement district for off-street parking purposes under the provisions of this section shall not prevent the subsequent establishment of improvement districts for any other purpose authorized by law.

H. If, in the opinion of the governing body, any portion of the territory of a district formed under this section is no longer benefited by the off-street parking sites provided, the governing body may, by resolution, summarily delete from the district formed under this section any such area, and may form a new district from the balance of the original district formed under this section.

#### Section 48-615. Special provisions relating to improvement districts for purchasing electricity for lighting public streets or parks

A. If a petition for the formation of an improvement district to purchase electricity for street or public park lighting is presented to the governing body, which purports to be signed by all of the real property owners in the proposed district, exclusive of mortgagees and other lienholders, the governing body, after verifying such ownership and making a finding of such fact, shall adopt a resolution of intention to order the improvement pursuant to the provisions of section 48-576 and shall have immediate jurisdiction to adopt the resolution ordering the improvement pursuant to provisions of section 48-581, without the necessity of publication and posting of the resolution of intention provided for in section 48-578.

#### Section 48-616. Improvement districts for purchasing energy for lighting public streets and parks; consolidation

A. In addition to the purposes for which an improvement district may be formed under the provisions of section 48-572, an improvement district may be formed for the sole purpose of purchasing and not generating energy for the lighting of the public streets and parks of the improvement district.

B. Subject to the limitations contained in this section, the powers and duties of the governing body of a municipality are as provided in this article for other types of improvement districts.

C. The governing body shall make annual statements and estimates of the expenses of the district that shall be provided for by the levy and collection of ad valorem taxes on the assessed value of all the property real and personal in the district or by an equal apportionment of taxes based on the number and classification of properties within the district, publish notice of the statements and estimates, hold hearings on them and adopt them at the times and in the manner provided for incorporated cities and towns' statements and estimates by applicable portions of title 42, chapter 17, article 3, and the governing body, on or before the third Monday in August each year, shall fix, levy and assess the amount to be raised by ad valorem taxes or by an equal apportionment of taxes on all of the property of the district and collect as county taxes are collected the amounts shown by the statements and estimates as adopted by the governing body.  All statutes providing for the levy and collection of general county taxes, including collection of delinquent taxes and sale of property for nonpayment of taxes, are applicable to the district taxes as provided to be levied by this section.

D. An improvement district formed under the provisions of this section shall not be authorized to issue bonds, and no assessment for district purposes against the property within the district shall exceed one dollar twenty cents per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation thereof in any year.

E. A district is not authorized to engage in any activity other than contracting for and purchasing of energy for street and public park lighting.

F. In the event the municipality is willing to participate in the costs of the lighting of streets in improvement districts, the governing body may by resolution summarily order participation.  If the municipality is willing to assume the total cost of the lighting, the council may summarily dissolve the district by resolution after payment of all liabilities.

G. The formation of an improvement district for street and public park lighting under the provisions of this section shall not prevent the subsequent establishment of improvement districts for other purposes, including improvement districts for the purpose of constructing street lighting facilities within any part or all of the same territory.

H. In the event an improvement district is formed that includes the construction and operation of street lighting facilities within all or any part of the territory of a district formed under this section, the governing body may by resolution summarily delete from the district formed under this section any area covered by a subsequently formed district and form a new district from the balance of the original district formed under this section.

I. The rate to be paid for the purchase of energy may include a charge for electric power, natural gas and other forms of energy and a charge for the use of lighting facilities if the established rate of the public service corporation or public agency imposes such a charge for the type of lighting facilities that the governing body determines shall be installed in accordance with section 48-617, subsection C.

J. In either a new or existing improvement district organized for purposes prescribed by this section, a majority of the real property owners may petition the governing body to levy ad valorem taxes or to equally apportion the taxes based on the number and classification of properties within the district.  If the petition is signed by the required number of owners of real property in the district, the governing body of the district shall declare the petition approved and shall provide that beginning on a date certain, all subsequent taxes levied for the benefit of the district shall be assessed and levied as prescribed by this subsection.

K. A municipality may by ordinance or resolution consolidate two or more existing improvement districts formed pursuant to section 48-615, 48-617 or this section into a single district as follows:

1. The municipality receives a petition signed by a majority of the real property owners in each of the districts that are proposed to be consolidated. The districts proposed to be consolidated shall be contiguous and new territory may not be included in the districts by way of the consolidation.  For the purposes of this paragraph, districts are contiguous if they either have a common boundary or are separated only by a public right-of-way.

2. The governing body publishes a notice of hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality in which the affected districts are located.  The notice shall be published at least ten days before the scheduled date of the hearing.  The notice shall include the date, time and place of a public hearing at which the consolidation will be considered.  The notice shall state the purpose of the hearing and shall describe where information on the proposed consolidation may be obtained and reviewed.  The information provided by the municipality shall include the name and a general description of the boundaries of each district that is proposed to be consolidated and a detailed, accurate map of the area to be included in the consolidation. The notice also shall contain an estimate of the assessed value of the consolidated district, the estimated change in the property tax liability or liability for equal apportionment for a typical resident of the proposed consolidated district and a list of the benefits and injuries that may result from the proposed consolidated district.

3. At the public hearing called by the municipality, interested persons may appear and give comment. After the public hearing, the governing body may adopt the ordinance or resolution consolidating the districts included in the petitions.

4. The consolidation shall take effect on July 1 immediately following the timely filing of notice of the consolidation with the department of revenue, the county assessor and the county treasurer as prescribed in subsection L of this section.

5. On the effective date of the consolidation, the separate districts that were consolidated shall terminate and the municipality shall pay all remaining liabilities of the formerly separate districts from monies of those separate districts, and transfer any remaining monies and all late tax payments thereafter received for the separate districts to the account of the consolidated district.

L. To be eligible to levy a tax within a district consolidated pursuant to subsection K of this section and notwithstanding section 42-17257, the municipality shall notify the department of revenue, the county assessor and the county treasurer of the district consolidation not later than June 1 immediately preceding the effective date of the consolidation.

M. New territory may be added to a district formed pursuant to this section, including a consolidated district formed pursuant to subsection K of this section, by giving notice of the added territory in the same manner as providing notice of improvement pursuant to this article.  Notice is not required to be given within the territory then in the district.  Protests and objections to the extent of the enlarged district may be filed only by persons who own real property within the territory proposed to be added to an existing district.

#### Section 48-617. Special provisions relating to improvement districts for purchasing energy for lighting public streets or parks

A. If a petition for the formation of an improvement district to purchase and not generate energy for street or public park lighting is presented to the governing body, which purports to be signed by all of the real property owners in the proposed district, exclusive of mortgagees and other lienholders, the governing body, after verifying such ownership and making a finding of such fact, shall adopt a resolution of intention to order the proposed improvement pursuant to the provisions of section 48-576 and shall have immediate jurisdiction to adopt the resolution ordering the improvement, pursuant to the provisions of section 48-581, without the necessity of publication and posting of the resolution of intention provided for in section 48-578.

B. If a petition for the formation of an improvement district to purchase energy for street or public park lighting is presented to the governing body signed by a majority of the real property owners in the proposed district, the governing body shall adopt a resolution of intention to order the proposed improvement and cause same to be published and posted pursuant to the provisions of section 48-578, and unless protests received pursuant to section 48-579 are sufficient to bar further proceedings, the governing body shall thereafter proceed with the improvements so petitioned.

C. At the time of the adoption of the resolution of intention pursuant to the provisions of section 48-576, the governing body shall determine the type of lighting facilities to be installed and consider the rate to be paid for purchasing the energy for the proposed district.

#### Section 48-618. Bond anticipation notes; form; procedures applicable

A. Whenever the governing body has determined in the resolution of intention that improvement bonds shall be issued, bond anticipation notes may be sold at any time after the award of a construction contract.

B. Bond anticipation notes shall be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of improvement bonds and monies collected from property owners wishing to pay all or part of their assessments in cash prior to the filing of the certified list of unpaid assessments as provided in section 48-597. The notes may be in such form and denomination as the governing body shall provide. The notes shall be executed by either the street superintendent or the city treasurer and attested by the clerk. The notes may bear interest from their date at a rate not in excess of the maximum rate to be borne on the bonds as shown in the resolution of intention. The term of the notes shall be not more than six months beyond the date set for completion of the construction, but the governing body shall always retain the option of repaying such notes in advance of maturity and without penalty and the further option to extend the life of the notes if the term of the construction contract is extended or if any default is made by the contractor. The notes shall be authorized by resolution of the governing body.

C. The total amount of notes to be issued for any work or improvement shall not be greater than the aggregate of ninety per cent of the contract price and the total estimated amount of incidental expenses. The notes shall be sold at not less than par at either public or private sale. When authorized by the governing body, the superintendent of streets may enter into loan agreements with the purchaser of the notes relative to:

1. The time and place of delivery.

2. The sale of improvement bonds to the purchaser of the notes if the municipality is unable to procure a purchaser willing to purchase the bonds when issued.

3. Making of the demand upon the owners of property for payment in cash.

4. Collection of cash payments from persons wishing to pay their assessments in cash and application of such cash payments to the repayment of the notes.

5. Payment of an additional fee to the purchaser of the notes to cover the administrative expenses of the cash collections if the purchaser is to be the person to whom cash collections are to be made.

D. To secure the payment of the notes the loan agreements may also provide for a collateral assignment to the purchaser of the notes of all cash collections, the warrant and the municipality's interest in the performance bond.

E. The proceeds from the sale of the notes shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the treasurer and to be used for payment of incidental expenses and payments to the construction contractor.

F. Proceeds from the sale of the notes shall be used to make semimonthly or monthly payments to be due and paid the contractor upon a basis of ninety per cent of the value of the work actually performed as estimated by the superintendent or engineer employed for such purpose to and including the fifteenth or last day of each calendar month. The balance shall be paid to the contractor after the sale of the bonds solely from the proceeds therefrom or if bonds equal to the balance remaining cannot be sold then the balance shall be paid by delivery of a like principal amount of bonds to the contractor.

G. The issuance of bond anticipation notes shall constitute an assignment to the municipality of the monies due the contractor under the construction contract. The municipality may agree with the construction contractor that the municipality will make the demands for cash payments as provided in section 48-590 or may authorize the purchaser of the bond anticipation notes to make the cash collections.

H. When bonds are issued to represent any assessments remaining unpaid at the date of the certified list, the city shall sell the bonds and use the proceeds to redeem the notes and pay the balance due the contractors.

I. In addition to the incidental expenses which may be included in the assessment, if bond anticipation notes are issued the superintendent of streets may also include in the incidental expenses all interest to accrue on the bond anticipation notes, the added costs of cash collections, if any, and all legal or financial fees incurred in the issuance and sale of the bond anticipation notes.

J. Whenever bond anticipation notes have been issued and the contractor has been paid in accordance with subsection F of this section the city shall apply the proceeds collected from demands upon the property owners to reduction of the outstanding portion of the bond anticipation notes, and when the notes have been paid, to the contractor to reduce any balance due him.

C. The fund established pursuant to this section shall be kept separate and apart from all other funds.

D. The monies in the revolving fund may be used to purchase bond anticipation notes, to aid in the payments made to the construction contractor, to provide for the payment of the city's share of any improvement authorized under this article or to provide monies to pay the assessments levied against public property.

#### Section 48-620. Improvement districts for underground utility and cable television facilities in public rights-of-way and easements; procedures; costs; definitions

A. Subject to the limitations contained in this section, the powers and duties of the governing body of a municipality for establishing underground utility facilities are as provided in this article for other types of improvement districts.

B. Notwithstanding section 48-507, after the governing body passes a resolution or notice declaring its intention to order an improvement district for underground utility facilities, the governing body shall hold a hearing at least thirty days after the completion of the posting and publication of the notice of intention pursuant to section 48-506. At the hearing, the governing body shall consider the issue of ordering an election on the formation of the improvement district and shall receive public comment on the proposed district. Section 48-507, regarding written protests of the proposed improvement, does not apply to a district formed pursuant to this section. The governing body may only order the election on the issue of formation of the district if the owners of real property in the district have signed and submitted petitions to the clerk of the governing body in support of the formation of the district. The petitions shall comply with the following:

1. Clearly state that they are petitions in support of the formation of an underground utility improvement district and shall specifically describe in words or by use of a map the location of the proposed district's boundaries. The petitions shall require the signer's signature, name and address or description of the property that is owned in the district in a manner sufficient to determine ownership through the use of public records.

2. Be signed by owners of a majority of the real property within the boundaries of the proposed district as measured by square footage or acreage owned. Signatures are not required to be notarized and for property with more than one owner, the signature of one owner is binding on the remaining owners of the property. On submittal to the clerk of the governing body, the petitions are a public record. Ownership of property is as of the date of the hearing and is determined by records of the county assessor or other public records regarding property ownership. For purposes of this paragraph, "owner" means a person, association, corporation or other entity without regard to residency.

C. If the governing body finds that sufficient signatures are submitted pursuant to subsection B of this section, the governing body may proceed with a simplified ballot card election pursuant to subsection G of this section. If there are not sufficient signatures, the governing body shall not proceed with the formation of the district. If no registered voters reside within the area of the proposed district, an election is not required and the governing body may declare the formation of the district.

D. The requirement pursuant to section 48-577 that plans and specifications be filed prior to adoption of the resolution of intention may be satisfied by a general plan showing at least the general location and type of facilities to be constructed. Actual plans and specifications shall be filed following the adoption of the resolution ordering the election regarding the improvement but before the election and the recording of the assessment and warrant. A person interested and objecting to an improvement or to the extent of the assessment district for a district established pursuant to this section may file a written protest with the city or town clerk within thirty days after completion or posting of the notice, or within thirty days after the date of the last publication of the notice if that date is after the completion of the posting.

E. The requirement pursuant to section 48-584 for notice of the award of contract may be satisfied by the inclusion in the resolution of intention of the name of the coordinating utility. The fifteen-day period for filing notice of objections under section 48-584, subsection E shall begin on completion of publication and posting of the notice of proposed improvement stating the name of the coordinating utility.

F. The governing body shall determine the boundaries of the district and designate the transmission facilities and, if applicable, any independent parallel facilities, to be placed underground and shall obtain from the coordinating utility an accurate statement of the costs of the project, including an estimate of the average cost in assessments on an average single family residence in the district. The amount shall be included in the engineer's estimate required by section 48-577. The costs shall include:

1. The amount by which the cost of placing facilities underground would exceed the cost of placing comparable facilities overhead.

2. The reconstruction cost and net depreciation costs of any existing facilities to be removed.

3. The actual costs of removing such existing facilities, less the salvage value of the facilities removed.

4. The charge to finance the costs prescribed in this subsection over a stated period of not to exceed fifteen years.

5. The tax reimbursement amount.

G. On receipt of an accurate estimate of the costs of the project, the governing body shall call a simplified ballot card election in the area affected by the proposed district. The simplified ballot card shall contain the words for a district formation election "district, yes" and "district, no" and for an assessment election "assessment, yes" and "assessment, no". A single simplified ballot card may be used for both the question of the formation of the district and the question of the assessment. The election may be conducted in a simplified format and administered by the governing body. The governing body shall mail to all registered voters and property owners within the proposed district simplified ballot cards with return postage prepaid. The simplified ballot card shall clearly state that to be valid a voted ballot card shall be returned to the governing body within thirty days after the governing body mails the ballot card and a ballot card that is not timely returned shall not be counted. A person who is qualified to vote in a municipal election for that municipality or a property owner who owns land within the proposed improvement district is qualified to vote in an election for a municipal improvement district formed pursuant to this section, except that only residents of or property owners in the area that is within the proposed district may vote. If a majority of the persons voting with the simplified ballot card approves the formation of the district and if a majority of the persons voting with the simplified ballot card approves the assessment, the governing body may form the district and make the assessment. If more than one governing body is affected by a proposed district, each governing body may form its own district for the portion of the work within its jurisdiction. Assessments for districts that are formed for a portion of the same project shall be distributed between districts in proportion to the benefits to be received. When the governing body acquires jurisdiction to order the work, it shall not call for construction bids but may enter into a contract or contracts with the utility, utilities or licensed cable television system whose facilities are to be placed underground. Prior to entering into a contract or contracts the coordinating utility shall submit a final report to the municipality. The amount stated in the final report may be based on detailed engineering studies. If the amount stated in the final report exceeds the amount stated in the preliminary report the governing body may either:

1. Terminate the project.

2. Call a new election on the improvement.

H. The contract shall provide for payment to the utility or licensed cable television system over a term of not to exceed fifteen years of the amount set forth in the final report, shall specify those facilities to be owned by the municipality and those to be owned by the utility, utilities or licensed cable television system and shall contain such provisions for the prepayment of any assessment at the option of any property owner, and such other terms, covenants and conditions as the governing body and the utility, utilities or licensed cable television system determine. The licensed cable television system shall not be entitled to reimbursement except where the cable television system's parallel facilities are installed to replace existing cable television facilities other than independent parallel facilities not included by the governing body in the work. The amount payable on the contract or contracts is payable solely from amounts collected on the assessment levied in the district. A payment or performance bond is not required of a utility or licensed cable television system entering into a contract with the governing body.

I. The municipality may retain an independent engineering consultant to review all reports, estimates and costs provided by the coordinating utility.

J. The coordinating utility shall advance or reimburse a governing body for the costs of forming the district and the cost of printing, advertising and posting incurred or to be incurred by a governing body and shall bear its own expenses for engineering and design, and preparing the reports, plans and specifications. On completion of the work, the coordinating utility shall reimburse a governing body for its reasonable expenses incurred with respect to the district. Unless otherwise provided for in a manner acceptable to the coordinating utility, the amounts advanced or reimbursed shall be included in the contract and in the amount assessed.

K. This section does not amend or modify any existing line extension policies of any utility involved. The costs to be reimbursed under the contract shall be reduced to the extent of amounts paid or to be paid by landowners or from other sources directly to the utility or cable television system for the installation of the facilities.

L. The assessment and warrant may be recorded at any time following approval of the project at an election. The hearing on the assessment may be held at any time not less than twenty days from the date of recording of the assessment and warrant. An additional hearing following notice from the superintendent of streets to the governing body of completion of the work shall be requested only if any member of the governing body or any owner of or any person claiming an interest in any lot that received an assessment, within one year of the date of the notice of completion, files a written notice with the clerk stating that the work has not been performed substantially in accordance with the resolution of intention, the plans and specifications and estimate. The notice shall state in particular the failure to perform and may also state, if applicable, any requested reduction in the assessment of any one or more parcels due solely to the failure of such performance. The notice shall state the name and address of the person filing the notice and shall describe such person's interest in land subject to assessment. The governing body may enforce the contract and may recess the hearing to permit the utility or licensed cable television system to complete the work. If the work cannot be completed, the assessment may be adjusted to take the failure to complete into consideration. The amount due under the agreement with the utility or licensed cable television system shall be adjusted accordingly. Repayment under the contract shall be conditioned on completion of the work and approval of the assessment as provided by law. Unless an objection has been filed, repayment shall begin within nine months of the notice of completion.

M. An improvement district formed pursuant to this section shall not issue bonds, and the assessment for district purposes against the property within the district shall not exceed the amount specified in the engineer's estimate. Notwithstanding any other statute, the assessment for an underground electrical power line shall not be assessed against the owners of the frontage of the right-of-way of the underground power line but shall be assessed against all property owners benefiting from the burial of the power line.

N. The governing body shall provide for the levy and collection of assessments on the real property in the district in the manner provided for in this article. However, the assessment may be paid in installments necessary to pay amounts due under the contract and to reimburse the municipality for expenses incurred as provided in the assessment.

O. A district formed under this section shall not engage in any activity other than contracting for or establishing underground transmission facilities together, where applicable, with parallel facilities.

P. The governing body by resolution may summarily determine that it will participate in the costs of the improvement. If the municipality is willing to assume the total outstanding assessment for the underground utility facilities, the governing body may summarily dissolve the district by resolution after payment of all liabilities including all amounts due under the contract.

Q. The formation of an improvement district for underground utility facilities under this section does not prevent the establishment of other improvement districts which may include all or part of the same property for any purposes authorized by law.

R. If a petition for the formation of an improvement district for underground utilities is presented to the governing body, and the petition purports to be signed by all of the real property owners in the proposed district exclusive of mortgagees and other lienholders, the governing body, after verifying such ownership and making a finding of such fact, may adopt a resolution of intention to order the proposed improvement pursuant to section 48-576 and has immediate jurisdiction to adopt the resolution ordering the improvement pursuant to section 48-581, without the necessity of publication and posting of the resolution of intention provided for in section 48-578.

S. If the governing body determines that a parcel of property is a single family residence and that payment of the assessment would cause a financial hardship on the owners which would be likely to cause a delinquency in payment of the assessment, the assessment for an improvement made under this section shall provide for an extension in the time to pay principal and interest on the assessment against that parcel for a period of time not to exceed ten years. If the governing body determines that the grounds for extension no longer exist, then the extension will be terminated and all payments that would have been due but for the extension shall become due.  The assessment shall provide for adjustments in the assessments against the remaining parcels to provide for timely payment under the agreement.

T. Notice of the passage of a resolution of intention for an improvement under this section shall be given to the corporation commission and, where the improvement involves a utility regulated thereby, the rural electrification administration.

U. In this section, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Coordinating utility" means the utility whose proposed or existing transmission facilities are to be placed underground. The coordinating utility is responsible for assembling into one report cost estimates and other data provided by each utility or licensed cable television system whose facilities are to be placed underground.

2. "Cost" means all costs of design and construction of facilities.

3. "Facilities" means any works or improvements used or useful in providing electric, communications, licensed cable television service or video service, including poles, supports, tunnels, manholes, vaults, conduits, pipes, wires, conductors, guys, studs, platforms, crossarms, braces, transformers, insulators, cutouts, switches, capacitors, meters, communication circuits, appliances, attachments and appurtenances but excluding any works for transmission by microwave or radio. Facilities shall include only transmission facilities and parallel facilities.

4. "Governing body" means the council of a city or town or the board of supervisors of a county.

5. "Independent parallel facilities" means existing parallel facilities that do not rely for their support on poles or other structures to be removed as part of the work. If the utility or licensed cable television system elects to remove the independent parallel facilities but the removal and underground replacement thereof was not included by the governing body in the work, the reconstruction and removal costs of such independent parallel facilities shall not be included in a contract or be assessed.

6. "Parallel facilities" means facilities that run or are permitted to run in the easement in which the transmission facilities are to be placed underground and that may be included underground with the transmission facilities, and facilities appurtenant thereto. Any parallel facilities shall have a right to be included underground and have access to a trench on such reasonable terms and conditions as the coordinating utility and the owners of the parallel facility may determine provided they do not interfere with the installation or operation of the transmission facilities.

7. "Private parallel facilities" means parallel facilities other than those owned or operated by a public utility or licensed cable television system. Private parallel facilities have the rights of parallel facilities except that the costs thereof shall not be included in a contract or be assessed.

8. "Tax reimbursement" means an annual charge for reimbursement for property taxes, or voluntary contributions in lieu of property taxes as provided in chapter 1, article 8 of this title, by applying the tax rates in effect on the date of adoption of the resolution of intention to the amount by which the estimated average taxable value of underground facilities, excluding the value of trenches, backfill and compaction, on completion exceeds the estimated average taxable value of comparable overhead facilities. In this paragraph, "estimated average taxable value" means the average of the estimated taxable value for each year of reimbursement. The value of the trenches, backfill and compaction of the underground facilities shall be attributed to and shall inure to the benefit of the owners of property within the district and shall be owned by the city. Reimbursement shall not be for a period longer than fifteen years.

9. "Transmission facilities" means facilities that are, or are appurtenant to, electric transmission lines of more than twenty-five kilovolts but not more than two hundred thirty kilovolts in size.

#### Section 48-621. Regulatory authority of utility undergroundings

The provisions of section 48-620 shall not be construed to limit or otherwise affect the authority of a municipality to regulate the undergrounding of utility facilities in the public rights-of-way and easements. The authority of a municipality to regulate the undergrounding of utilities or the erection of poles and wires upon its streets, alleys, public grounds and plazas as authorized by section 9-276 shall in no way be impaired or affected by the provisions of section 48-620.

#### Section 48-622. Wastewater treatment or drinking water facility and nonpoint source projects; loan repayment agreements; definition

A. Notwithstanding any other law, a municipal improvement district may construct, acquire or improve a wastewater treatment facility, drinking water facility or nonpoint source project with monies borrowed from or financial assistance including forgivable principal provided by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona.

B. To repay a loan from the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona, a municipal improvement district may enter into a loan repayment agreement with the authority. A loan repayment agreement is payable from any revenues otherwise authorized by law to be used to pay long-term obligations.

C. The governing body shall obtain approval for the loan repayment agreement in the same manner provided by law for approving and issuing other long-term obligations payable from those revenues that are to be used to pay the loan.

Loan agreements may provide for paying interest on the unpaid principal balance of the agreement at the rates established in the agreement. The agreement may also provide for paying the municipal improvement district's proportionate share of the expenses of administering the clean water and drinking water revolving funds established by sections 49-1221 and 49-1241 and may provide that the municipal improvement district pay financing and loan administration fees approved by the water infrastructure finance authority. These costs may be included in the assessment amounts pledged to repay the loan. Districts are bound by and shall fully perform the loan repayment agreements, and the agreements are incontestable after the loan is funded by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona. The municipal improvement district shall also agree to pay the authority's costs in issuing bonds or otherwise borrowing to fund a loan. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 48-597, principal and interest on a loan repayment agreement may be paid on the dates and in the manner agreed upon by the municipality and the authority.

E. A loan repayment agreement under this section does not create a debt of the municipal improvement district, and the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona shall not require that payment of a loan agreement be made from other than those sources permitted in subsection B of this section.

F. A municipal improvement district may employ or contract for the services of attorneys, accountants, financial consultants and other experts in their field as deemed necessary to perform services with respect to the loan repayment agreement.

G. This section is supplemental and alternative to any other law under which a municipal improvement district may borrow money or issue bonds. This section shall not be construed as the exclusive authorization to enter into loan agreements with the water infrastructure finance authority.

H. For purposes of this section, "nonpoint source project" has the same meaning prescribed in section 49-1201.

### Article 3 - General Improvement Fund and Investment Bonds

#### Section 48-631. Authority to provide general improvement fund

Municipal corporations may incur a bonded indebtedness to provide a fund to be called a "general improvement fund." The fund may be invested or reinvested in any bonds issued for work and public improvements, the cost of which in whole or in part is to be ultimately paid by assessments levied against lots or land benefited thereby, or issued to pay the cost of land purchased or condemned for such work or public improvements. The bonds shall be called "investment bonds."

#### Section 48-632. Procedure for investment bond election

A. When the governing body of a municipality at a meeting has determined that the public interest or necessity demands the acquisition, construction or completion of an improvement authorized by articles 1 and 2 of this chapter, it may at that or a subsequent meeting, by a vote of a majority of all its members, order a special election and submit to the qualified electors of the municipality the proposition of issuing the investment bonds.

B. The resolution calling the election shall recite the objects and purposes for which it is proposed to use the proceeds of the bonds, the amount of the principal thereof, the rate of interest to be paid thereon, and shall fix the date on which the special election will be held, the manner of holding the election and manner of voting for or against issuing such bonds.

C. The election, except as otherwise provided in this article, shall be held, and the return thereof made and canvassed and the elector shall possess the qualifications as provided by law for holding bond elections in the municipality.

#### Section 48-633. Publication and posting of resolution for bond election; form of bonds; payment and redemption

A. The resolution shall be published as provided by section 39-121 and posted in three public places in the municipality for one week. It shall require the votes of a majority of the qualified voters voting at the special election to authorize the issuance of the bonds.

B. The bonds shall contain necessary provisions as to form and shall be payable in not less than ten nor more than twenty years from the date of their issue to be determined by the governing body at the time of their issuance, and shall be issued in such denominations as the governing body may determine, of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars. Each bond shall be payable on the day and at the place therein specified with interest at the rate or rates set by the accepted bid which shall not exceed the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election, payable semiannually. The bonds shall be signed by the mayor and countersigned by the clerk. The coupons of the bonds shall be numbered consecutively and signed by the clerk.

C. The governing body shall provide by tax levies or otherwise proper interest and sinking funds for the payment of the interest on, and the redemption of, the bonds.

#### Section 48-634. Sale of bonds; disposition of proceeds

The bonds may be issued and sold by the governing body as it may determine at public or private sale or by an on-line bidding process, but for not less than par.  The proceeds shall be placed in the treasury to the credit of a fund to be applied exclusively to the purposes and objects prescribed by this article.

#### Section 48-635. Disposition and investment of bond sale proceeds

A. The governing body shall keep the funds arising from the sale of the bonds separate and distinct from other funds, and invest and reinvest them in the improvement bonds issued for work and public improvements, or used for the purposes provided in articles 1 and 2 of this chapter, and shall collect the interest and principal on the bonds and credit it to the fund.

B. The municipality may sell, at the discretion of its governing body, any of the bonds by it purchased at a price not less than the price paid therefor and accrued interest. The receipts of the sale and all monies paid on account of assessments levied upon lots benefited by the improvements for which the improvement bonds have been issued shall be credited to the "general improvement fund," and may be again reinvested, or used, so that the improvement fund shall constitute a revolving fund for the purpose of enabling the property owners to pay their bonds and assessments in annual installments to the municipality, and thus enable the municipality to let contracts for the completion of the improvements on a cash basis.

### Article 4 - Refunding Municipal Improvement Districts Bonds for Savings

#### Section 48-651. Refunding bonds

A. Bonds may be issued for the purpose of refunding any bonds issued pursuant to article 2 or 3 of this chapter.

B. Refunding bonds issued pursuant to this article shall have such details and be issued and sold as provided by the governing body of the city or town and shall be secured as provided in this article, except that interest on the refunding bonds shall be payable semiannually on January 1 and July 1 and the due date of the refunding bond shall be January 1 in the year in which it becomes due.

 

#### Section 48-652. Use of net proceeds; investment of proceeds; definition

A. Refunding bonds issued pursuant to this article may be exchanged for not less than a like principal amount of bonds to be refunded, may be sold at, above or below par at a negotiated or public sale or may be exchanged in part and sold in part.  If sold, the net proceeds of the refunding bonds together with all or a portion of the amounts held in the debt service fund for payment of principal of and interest on the bonds being refunded, amounts in any reserve fund for the bonds being refunded and other amounts lawfully available may be invested provided such investments and any reinvestment thereof will mature with interest so as to provide funds to pay the bonds to be refunded when due, or called for redemption, together with interest thereon and redemption premiums, if any, at maturity or on an available redemption date or on an earlier voluntary surrender with the consent of the city or town.  Such amounts and investments shall be deposited in trust with a national banking corporation or association that is authorized to do trust business in this state and that is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation, or any successor agency.  After such deposit, the bonds being refunded shall be deemed to have been paid and shall have no further interest in the assessments for the bonds being refunded.

B. The treasurer may enter into trust agreements with banking corporations or associations for the handling, safekeeping and administration of the amounts and investments that are derived from, or contributed to, the refunding.  The investments shall be obligations issued by the United States government, or one of its agencies, or obligations fully guaranteed by the United States government as to principal and interest.

C. For the purposes of this section, "net proceeds" means the gross proceeds of the refunding bonds after the deduction of all accrued interest and expenses incurred in connection with the authorization and issuance of the refunding bonds and the refunding of the bonds being refunded including all cost and expenses resulting from price variation to par or otherwise incurred in the purchase of obligations for the trust and in the distribution of the refunding bonds.

 

#### Section 48-653. Limitation on refunding bonds; notice and hearing; definition

A. Refunding bonds may be issued only if the total amount of principal of and interest on the refunding bonds does not exceed the total amount of remaining principal of and interest on the bonds to be refunded. The superintendent shall file a modified assessment reflecting the reduction in the assessment.  If the modified assessment does not increase the assessment on any parcel or lot, the modified assessment may be approved by the governing body without providing notice or a hearing to the owners of affected parcels or lots.  If the modification results in an increase in the assessment to any parcel or lot, notice and, if required, a hearing shall be provided in the manner as provided in section 48-594.

B. For the purposes of this section, "superintendent" has the same meaning prescribed in section 48-571.

 

#### Section 48-654. Security; payment

A. The refunding bonds shall be secured and payable from the special assessments levied to pay the bonds being refunded. On issuance of refunding bonds, the remaining unpaid installments of such special assessments shall be recalculated and modified so that the amounts to be collected equal the amounts needed to repay the refunding bonds.  Section 48-594 does not apply to the recalculation and modification of the assessments authorized by this section.  All provisions of articles 2 and 3 of this chapter regarding the collection, payment and enforcement of the assessments for the bonds being refunded and the validity and priority of the lien of the assessments for the bonds being refunded remain in full force and effect. Except as modified pursuant to this section, the assessments survive the payment or defeasance of the bonds being refunded and shall remain in full force and effect, securing the refunding bonds until the payment in full of the refunding bonds.

B. The refunding bonds are payable only out of a special fund to be collected from such special assessments.  The special fund is set apart for the payment of the refunding bonds and cannot be used for any other purpose. All sums collected from such special assessments shall be placed in the special fund and shall be used for no other purpose than payment of the principal of and interest on the refunding bonds.

C. The special assessments from which the refunding bonds are to be paid are the same first liens on the property assessed for the bonds being refunded, subject only to the lien for general taxes and prior special assessments.  For the assessment or reassessment, collection and payment of the special assessments, the full faith and diligence of the city or town are irrevocably pledged.

 

#### Section 48-655. Collection of assessments

The treasurer and the county treasurer for the county in which the city or town is located may enter into an agreement for the county treasurer to collect the special assessments for the refunding bonds in the manner and by the officers provided by law for the collection and enforcement of general taxes.  The treasurer and the county treasurer may provide by agreement for the payment of the county treasurer's collection expenses directly related to the levy of the special assessment and, if provided, the levy of the special assessment may include an amount for compensation of the county treasurer directly related to the collection of the special assessment. The compensation received by the county treasurer pursuant to the agreement is subject to section 11-496.

 

#### Section 48-656. Determination of governing body

The determination of the governing body issuing refunding bonds that the limitations imposed pursuant to this article on the issuance of refunding bonds have been met shall be conclusive in the absence of fraud or arbitrary and gross abuse of discretion.

When the governing body of an incorporated city or town determines to borrow money under the provisions of this article, the question of issuing bonds under this article shall be submitted to the qualified electors of the municipality. No bonds shall be issued without the assent of a majority of such qualified electors voting at an election held for that purpose as provided in this article.

#### Section 48-684. Registration of voters

The governing body may require the registration of all persons desiring to vote at the election and in such case the election resolution shall state the dates, times and places when and where such persons may register. Registration shall begin not less than ten and shall close not less than five days prior to the date of the election.

#### Section 48-685. Ballots

At the election the ballot shall contain the words "for the bonds" and "against the bonds" and to the right of and opposite each thereof shall be placed a square approximately the size of the squares placed opposite the names of candidates on ballots.

No other question, word or figure need be printed on any ballot. The ballot shall not be of any particular size, and sample ballots may or may not be printed, posted or distributed. A number of ballots exceeding by not less than two per cent the number of registered voters whose names appear on the precinct register prepared for the precinct, town or city shall be printed for and furnished to each polling place.

#### Section 48-686. Canvass of returns

The governing body shall canvass the returns and declare the result of the election. If it is found by the governing body that a majority of the real property taxpayers who are qualified electors of the municipality voting thereon assent to the issuance of the bonds, the governing body shall provide for the issuance of the bonds. The determination of the governing body that a majority of the qualified real property taxpayers voting thereon has assented to the issuance of the bonds shall be conclusive in any action or proceeding involving the validity of such election or the determination or declaration of the result thereof instituted after the date of the payment for and delivery of the bonds.

#### Section 48-687. Application of election laws

Except as otherwise provided in this article, the manner of conducting the registration and election, keeping the poll lists, the returns, declaring the results and doing all acts relating to such election shall conform to the procedure provided by law for the registration and qualification of electors and the holding of special elections in which the question of the issuance of bonds of municipal corporations is submitted to an election.

#### Section 48-688. Form of bonds; interest rates; redemption; payment of principal and interest; additional security; definition

A. Bonds issued under this article shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes provided by title 47.  They may be in one or more series, may bear dates, may be payable in a medium of payment and at places, may carry registration privileges, may have that priority or lien position between bondholders, shall be executed in a manner, may contain other terms, covenants and conditions, and shall be in a form as the governing body by resolution prescribes.  The final payment shall be due not more than thirty years from the date of issuance, as the governing body may prescribe.  Any or all of the bonds shall be callable at times, on terms and in a manner as the governing body by resolution prescribes.

B. Any or all of the bonds may be sold by calling for bids at public sale, through an on-line bidding process, under an accelerated bidding process or by negotiated sale.  If sold under an accelerated bidding process, the bonds shall be sold at the lowest cost the governing body deems then available after having received at least three pricing quotations from recognized purchasers of bonds of the type being sold. If sold at public sale, the bonds shall be sold to the bidder making the best bid.  If bonds are sold through an on-line bidding process, bids for the bonds that are entered into the system may be concealed until a specified time or disclosed in the on-line bidding process, may be subject to improvement in favor of the district before a specified time and may be for an entire issue of bonds or specified maturities according to the manner, terms and notice provisions ordered by the governing body.

C. The bonds may be sold below, at or above par. If an issue of bonds is sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount plus interest to be paid on the bonds must not exceed the amount of interest that would be payable on the bonds over the maturity schedule prescribed by the governing body at the maximum rate set out in the resolution calling the election at which the bonds were voted.

D. If sold at public sale, the governing body shall call for bids for the bonds by giving notice at least once a week for two successive weeks in cities having a population of fifteen thousand or more persons according to the most recent federal census, and once a week for four successive weeks in all other cities and towns by publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the county. The notice shall be in the form prescribed by the governing body. The bids shall be for the entire bond issue unless the governing body by resolution allows bidding in parcels of less than the entire issue. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, bonds may be sold to natural persons residing in this state by negotiated sale on terms the governing body deems to be the best then available and may bear interest payable at times as shall be determined by the governing body. The bonds may be sold below, at or above par, provided that if the bonds are sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount plus interest to be paid on the bonds must not exceed the amount of interest that would be payable on the bonds over the maturity schedule prescribed by the governing body at the maximum rate set out in the resolution calling the election at which the bonds were voted.

E. Bonds issued by a city or town may bear interest at any rate or rates not in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election, payable at the times determined by the governing body, provided that each bond may be evidenced by one instrument, or if commercial paper by a succession of instruments each bearing interest payable only at maturity. Bonds or commercial paper issued under this article shall be subject to the following:

1. The bonds may bear interest at a fixed, variable or combination rate, none of which exceeds the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election.

2. A variable rate shall be based on any objective measure of the current value of money borrowed such as the announced prime rate of a bank, the rates borne by obligations of the United States or an index or other formula provided for by the governing body. The governing body shall employ a recognized agent in municipal bonds to market and remarket the bonds or commercial paper issued and to establish an interest rate in accordance with the approved index or formula.

3. The governing body may grant to the owner of any bond a right to tender or may require the tender of the bond for payment or purchase at one or more times before maturity and may enter into appropriate agreements with any bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company for the purchase of bonds so tendered. The agreement may provide that while the bonds are held by the bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company the bonds may bear interest at a rate higher than when the bonds are held by other owners, but not in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election.

4. If bonds are tendered before maturity under an agreement to pay for or purchase bonds when so tendered, the city or town may provide for the purchase and resale of the bonds pursuant to the tenders without extinguishing the obligation represented by them or incurring a new obligation on the resale, whether or not the bonds are represented by the same instruments when purchased as when resold.

5. Compensation for the resale of the bonds shall not be based on or measured by the difference between the price at which the bonds are purchased and the price at which they are resold.

6. The governing body may:

(a) Contract with a bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company to provide additional security for the bonds in the form of a line of credit, letter of credit, insurance policy or other security.

(b) Pay the costs of an additional security from amounts provided in the bond issue or from other available sources and may enter into reimbursement obligations in connection with the cost of the additional security.

7. Any reimbursement obligation entered into with the bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company shall not provide for the payment of interest in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election. The reimbursement obligation does not constitute a general obligation of the city or town and is payable from the same source as the bonds, or from other available revenues, as determined by the governing body.

8. Variable rate bonds and commercial paper may be sold at competitive public sale, through an on-line bidding process or at negotiated sale. A competitive public sale may be accomplished pursuant to a notice of sale published at the times and in the manner provided in subsection D. This notice shall provide terms and conditions as may be determined by the governing body.

9. If bonds are to be issued in the form of commercial paper the governing body shall first provide for the establishment of the schedule for the maturities of the bonds within the maximum period permitted by the voted proposition. The individual instruments representing the bonds may mature over shorter periods and may be retired with proceeds of subsequent instruments, or with the proceeds of definitive bonds, but they shall be finally paid according to the schedule of bond maturities or earlier.

10. Bonds issued in the form of commercial paper may be sold through an agent in the form of instruments that mature at intervals the agent determines to be most advantageous to the issuer after giving public notice to potential investors as determined by the governing body.

11. Bonds may be issued as compound interest bonds bearing interest payable only at maturity but compounded periodically until that date at a fixed rate no higher than the rate set forth in the resolution calling the election.

F. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, interim receipts or certificates may be issued to the purchaser of the bonds in a form and with provisions as the governing body prescribes.

G. The principal of and interest on the bonds shall be payable primarily from the proceeds of revenues derived from taxes, fees, charges and other monies collected by the state and returned to the cities and towns for street and highway purposes pursuant to law.

H. As additional security for the payment of the bonds, a city or town, by resolution submitted to the electors at a special election called for this purpose, and on the approval of the resolution by a majority of the voters voting at the election, may pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of the bonds, and if the pledge is made, and the revenues pledged to the payment of the bonds are at any time insufficient, the city or town shall be obligated to pay the bonds with interest to the same extent as other general obligation bonds of the city or town, and shall be reimbursed from subsequent revenues received by the city or town from taxes, fees, charges and other monies collected by the state and returned to the city or town for street and highway purposes pursuant to law.

I. For purposes of this section, "on-line bidding process" means a procurement process in which the governing body receives bids electronically over the internet in a real-time, competitive bidding event.

 

#### Section 48-689. Issuance of bonds for public improvements; limitations of amount, successive borrowings; computation

A. No city or town may issue bonds under this article unless the aggregate amount of the revenues received by it from highway user taxes, including motor vehicle fuel taxes, and all other taxes, fees, charges or other monies returned to the city or town pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, in the year preceding the borrowing of money under this article, is equal to at least one and one-half times the highest annual principal and interest requirements thereafter to come due on all such bonds to be outstanding after the borrowing occurs, provided that bonds that are issued under this article where the aggregate amount of monies returned to the city or town pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, in the year preceding the borrowing of money under this article, is not equal to at least two times the highest annual principal and interest requirements thereafter to become due on all the bonds to be outstanding after the borrowing occurs, shall bear a rating at the time of issuance of "A" or better, by at least one nationally recognized credit rating service taking into account any credit enhancement facility in effect with respect to such bonds. Subject to such limitations, successive borrowings may be made under this article.

#### Section 48-690. Expansion of pledge; effect on prior elections; refunding bonds; conflict of interest

A. All bonds issued pursuant to this article shall be paid from, and may hereafter be secured by a pledge of, all revenues received by the city or town issuing the bonds, from taxes, fees, charges and other monies collected by the state and returned to such city or town for street and highway purposes pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107.

B. Any city or town which has submitted the question of issuing bonds to its electorate and has received authority therefrom to issue bonds as provided by this article may issue such bonds in the amount and for the purposes approved by its electors notwithstanding the fact that the resolutions ordering and calling such election may have limited the revenues available for repayment to the monies received by such city or town from motor vehicle fuel tax.

C. Whenever the governing body of any city or town determines that the best interests of such municipality will be served by the issuance of refunding bonds in order to refund bonds secured by the pledge of revenues received pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, the governing body may issue refunding bonds on behalf of the municipality to refund the bonds issued pursuant to this article. Such refunding bonds shall be payable at such dates, in such amounts and at such rates of interest as the governing body by resolution may decide, shall be secured by a pledge of all monies received pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, and in all other respects the form and character of the refunding bonds shall conform with the provisions of section 48-688. The refunding bonds may be sold at public or private sale, at the price the governing body deems to be the best price available therefor which price may be below, at, or above par, or the refunding bonds may be exchanged for a like amount of bonds being refunded, with all unmatured coupons attached thereto, or the refunding bonds or proceeds from the sale of the refunded bonds may be exchanged for a sufficient amount of cash to pay all legal, financial and all other expenses incurred by the municipality in the issuance of the bonds plus obligations issued by or guaranteed by the United States which obligations with interest thereon will provide sufficient monies to pay, when due or called for prior redemption at the option of the municipality, all refunded bonds and the coupons appertaining thereto and any redemption premiums, if applicable. The governing body may provide that any securities acquired from refunded bond proceeds or from exchange of the refunding bonds for United States government securities be delivered to a bank or trust company doing business in this state to act as trustee or escrow agent to protect the rights of the holders of the refunded bonds. The governing body may execute such trust or escrow agreements as it sees fit to protect the rights of the holders of the refunded bonds and may pay the fees, costs and expenses of such trustee or escrow agent and also all legal, financial paying agent's fees or charges and all other costs incidental to the issuance of the refunding bonds, either from refunding bond proceeds or from monies received pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107.

D. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 38-501 or of any other law, it shall not be a conflict of interest for the holder of any bond authorized by this article, or for a person contracting with the issuing city or town, to purchase any such bond, to offer to sell or exchange, or to contract to sell or exchange, or to sell or exchange any federal government securities or obligations to the municipality to be used for the purposes set forth in subsection C of this section, nor shall it be a conflict of interest for any trustee, escrow agent or paying agent to purchase for their account or for the account of another any bond issued under authority of this article.

#### Section 48-691. Separate fund to pay interest and principal upon maturing installment

After any indebtedness is incurred under the provisions of this article, the treasurer of the city or town, during each year such indebtedness continues, shall set aside in a separate fund from the revenues received during such year from highway user taxes, including motor vehicle fuel taxes, and all other taxes, fees, charges or other monies returned to the city or town pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, an amount sufficient to pay the interest and principal upon the installment on such indebtedness next maturing.

The canvass may be continued from time to time. Failure of a majority to vote in favor of the matter submitted does not prejudice the submission of the same or similar matters at a later election.

E. If a person listed on the assessment roll is no longer the owner of land in the district and the name of the successor owner becomes known and is verified by recorded deed or other similar evidence of transfer of ownership, the successor owner is deemed to be the owner for the purposes of this article.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, if a petition for formation is signed by owners of all of the land in the district described in the petition and is approved by the municipality or county, the municipality or county may waive any or all requirements of posting, publication, mailing, notice, hearing and landowner election.

Any fees or other charges paid by the applicant before formation of the district that exceed the actual costs of forming the district shall be transferred by the municipality or county to the district and the district shall use the transferred monies solely to support the formation or administration of the district, including the issuance and sale of bonds.

#### Section 48-719. General obligation bonds; tax levy; security

A. At any time after the hearing on formation of the district, the district board, or, if before formation, the governing body, may from time to time order and call a general obligation bond election to submit to the qualified electors of the district or to those persons who are qualified to vote pursuant to section 48-707, subsection G the question of authorizing the district board to issue general obligation bonds of the district to provide monies for any public infrastructure purposes consistent with the general plan. The election may be held in conjunction with the formation election.

B. If general obligation bonds are approved at an election, the district board may issue and sell general obligation bonds of the district.

C. The district may issue and sell refunding bonds to refund any general obligation bonds of the district. If general obligation bonds are issued to refund any general obligation bonds of the district, an election on the issuance of such refunding bonds is not required.

D. After the bonds are issued, the district board shall enter in its minutes a record of the bonds sold and their numbers and dates and shall annually levy and cause an ad valorem tax to be collected, at the same time and in the same manner as other taxes are levied and collected on all taxable property in the district, sufficient, together with any monies from the sources described in section 48-717, to pay debt service on the bonds when due. The annual levy shall not exceed the net amount necessary to meet annual payments of principal and interest, projected payments of principal and interest on new debt planned for the ensuing year, a reasonable delinquency factor, including an amount necessary to correct prior year errors or shortages in the levy, if applicable, and any expenses and fees required in conjunction with the authorization pursuant to section 35-512.  The levy shall be the net of all cash in excess of ten percent of the annual payments of principal and interest in the current fiscal year from the previous year remaining in the fund or funds prescribed by subsection E of this section.

E. Monies derived from the levy of the tax provided in this section when collected constitute funds to pay the debt service on the bonds and shall be kept separately from other funds of the district.  Amounts levied for debt service on bonds payable from the secondary tax are and shall be considered special revenues of the district, shall be kept in a special, segregated fund, are not and shall not be general property taxes and may not be used for any other purpose of the district.

F. All bonds, heretofore and hereafter issued, are secured by a lien on all revenues received pursuant to the tax levy. The lien arises automatically without the need for any action or authorization by the district or the district board. The lien is valid and binding from the time of the issuance of the bonds. The revenues received pursuant to the levy of the tax are immediately subject to the lien.  The lien attaches immediately to the revenues and is effective, binding and enforceable against the district, the district's successors, transferees and creditors and all other parties asserting rights in the revenues, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the lien, without the need for any physical delivery, recordation, filing or further act.

#### Section 48-720. Revenue bonds; fees and charges

A. At any time after the hearing on formation of the district, the district board may hold a hearing on the question of authorizing the district board to issue revenue bonds of the district to provide monies for any public infrastructure purposes consistent with the general plan.

B. If revenue bonds are approved by resolution, the district board may issue and sell revenue bonds of the district.

C. The district board may pledge to the payment of its revenue bonds any revenues of the district or revenues to be collected by the municipality or county in trust for the district and returned to the district.

D. The district shall prescribe fees and charges, and shall revise them when necessary, to generate revenue sufficient, together with any monies from the sources described in section 48-717, to pay when due the principal and interest of all revenue bonds for the payment of which revenue has been pledged. The establishment or revision of any rates, fees and charges shall be identified and noticed concurrently with the annual budget process of the district pursuant to section 48-716.

E. If, in the resolution of the district board, the revenues to be pledged were limited to certain types of revenues, only those types of revenues may be pledged and only those revenues must be maintained.

F. No holder of revenue bonds issued under this article may compel any exercise of the taxing power of the district, municipality or county to pay the bonds or the interest on the bonds. Revenue bonds issued under this article are not a debt of the district, municipality or county, nor is the payment of revenue bonds enforceable out of any monies other than the revenue pledged to the payment of the bonds.

G. The district may issue and sell refunding bonds to refund any revenue bonds of the district.

 

#### Section 48-721. Special assessments; special assessment bonds

A. The district board, by resolution and pursuant to the procedures prescribed by sections 48-576 through 48-589, as nearly as practicable, or such other procedures as the district board provides, may levy an assessment of the costs of any public infrastructure purpose, any operation and maintenance of public infrastructure or any enhanced municipal services on any land in the district based on the benefit determined by the district board to be received by the land. Before the issuance of special assessment bonds the district may enter into a written agreement with a landowner as to the manner in which the assessment is to be allocated if the land is to be divided into more than one parcel. If an issue of special assessment bonds finances more than one purpose or service, the benefit received by the land, in the discretion of the district, may be determined by reference to the purposes and services as a whole or individually. The assessment may be based on estimated costs and amended to reflect actual costs, and the preparation of plans and specifications and the awarding of the contract are not a prerequisite to the levying of the assessment. An owner of land on which an assessment has been levied may seek judicial review of whether the land is benefited by the proposed infrastructure, on the merits, by special action filed with the court of appeals pursuant to the procedures of section 48-706, within thirty days after the effective date of the resolution.

B. After adoption by the district board of a resolution levying a special assessment on property in the district pursuant to section 48-709, subsection A, paragraph 11 the district board may issue and sell special assessment bonds payable from amounts collected from the special assessments, from amounts available from time to time in any reserve fund established for those special assessment bonds and from any other amounts available for those purposes as prescribed by section 48-717. The district and the county treasurer for the county in which the district is located may enter into an agreement for the county treasurer to collect the district's special assessments in the manner and by the officers provided by law for the collection and enforcement of general taxes.  The district and the county treasurer may provide by agreement for the payment of the county treasurer's collection expenses directly related to the levy of the special assessment and, if so provided, the levy of the special assessment may include an amount for compensation of the county treasurer directly related to the collection of the special assessment. The compensation received by the county treasurer pursuant to the agreement shall be governed by section 11-496. The district board may also issue and sell bond anticipation notes pursuant to the procedures prescribed in section 48-2081 or with procedures as similar to those as is practicable.  The assessment shall be a first lien on the property assessed subject only to general property taxes and prior special assessments. In the event of nonpayment of an assessment and except as otherwise provided in an agreement between the district and the county treasurer pursuant to this section, the procedures for collection of delinquent assessments, sale of delinquent property and issuance and effect of the superintendent's deed prescribed by sections 48-601 through 48-607 apply, as nearly as practicable, except that in no event is the district or the municipality required to purchase the delinquent land at the sale if there is no other purchaser.  If the landowner owns more than one parcel in the district, the district board may provide procedures for the collection and enforcement of assessments as the board deems appropriate by contract with a landowner to allow the sale of any or all of the landowner's parcels in the district if the landowner becomes delinquent as to any parcel that the landowner owns in the district.

C. On adoption of the resolution, but before issuance of the special assessment bonds, the district may direct the treasurer to make demand on the owners of the property so assessed, as shown on the property tax roll, for advance payment of the amount assessed.  The demand shall state a date not less than twenty days after the date of adoption of the ordinance after which the treasurer may refuse to accept advance payments of the assessment. The treasurer shall certify to the clerk on or after the date specified in the demand the amount collected and the assessments remaining unpaid against each parcel of land assessed.  Special assessment bonds may not be issued in an amount in excess of the amount assessed in the ordinance or, if advance payments are demanded, the amount certified to the clerk. The district may adopt procedures for prepayment and provisions for payment and reallocation of assessments.

D. The district, by resolution and pursuant to the procedures prescribed by article 4 of this chapter, as nearly as practicable, may issue and sell refunding bonds to refund any special assessment bonds of the district.

#### Section 48-722. Terms of bonds

A. Notwithstanding article 2 of this chapter, with respect to any bonds the district board shall prescribe the denominations of the bonds, the size of each issue and the form of the bonds and shall establish the maturities, interest payment dates and interest rates, whether fixed or variable, not exceeding the maximum rate stated in the notice of the election or the resolution of the district board. The bonds may be sold by competitive bid or negotiated sale for public or private offering at, below or above par. If the bonds are sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount and interest to be paid on the bonds shall not exceed the amount of interest that would have been payable on those bonds pursuant to the maturity schedule prescribed by the district board at the maximum rate set out in the bond resolution.

B. If general obligation bonds of the district are sold above par, the amount of net premium associated with a general obligation bond issue may be used only for the following purposes:

1. To pay any or all costs incurred in issuing the general obligation bonds.

2. As a deposit in a debt service fund and used only to pay interest on the issue of general obligation bonds.

C. If used for any purpose other than as prescribed in subsection B of this section, and if the district has general obligation bond voter authorization and available capacity under its debt limitations prescribed by section 48-708, subsection B, the amount of net premium used for that purpose shall reduce in an equal amount both the available aggregate indebtedness capacity of the district prescribed in section 48-708, subsection B and the principal amount authorized at the general obligation bond election for the district from which the issue of general obligation bonds is being sold.  Any net premium that is used as prescribed in this subsection shall be amortized for all debt limitation purposes on a pro rata basis each year by multiplying the net premium used by a percentage equal to the percentage of the total principal amount of the general obligation bond issue that matures in that year.

D. The proceeds of the sales shall be deposited with the treasurer, or with a trustee or agent designated by the district board, to the credit of the district to be withdrawn for the purposes provided by this article. Pending that use, the proceeds may be invested as determined by the district. The bonds may contain such terms, conditions, covenants and agreements as the district board deems proper. The bonds may be payable from any combination of taxes, revenues or special assessments of the types described in sections 48-719, 48-720 and 48-721 and as specified in the bonds provided that all applicable requirements of those sections are met.

#### Section 48-723. District taxes; annual financial estimate and budget

A. Except as provided in subsection D of this section and at any time after the hearing on formation of the district, the district board, or, if before formation, the governing body, may call an election to submit to the qualified electors of the district or to the persons qualified to vote pursuant to section 48-707, subsection G the question of authorizing the district board to levy an ad valorem tax on the net assessed limited property value of all the real and personal property in the district at a rate or rates that do not exceed the maximum rate or rates specified in the ballot. All taxes attributable to the operation and maintenance expenses of the district, excluding expenses for an area described in section 48-709, subsection H, shall not exceed an amount equal to $.30 per $100 of net assessed limited property valuation for all real and personal property in the district, unless a higher rate is approved by a vote of the electors of the district, or by the persons who are qualified to vote as provided in section 48-707, subsection G, voting at an election not less than three years after the date of the formation of the district. The election may be held in conjunction with the formation election. Once approved at an election, the maximum rate remains in effect until increased or decreased at a subsequent election. If a maximum rate is in effect, the district board, on petition of twenty-five percent of the qualified electors of the district, or by those persons owning twenty-five percent of the land area who are qualified to vote pursuant to section 48-707, subsection G, shall call an election to reduce the maximum tax rate but not below the lesser of that rate determined by the district board to be necessary to maintain the district's facilities and improvements or the actual rate then in effect. On the presentation to the district board of a petition signed by the owners of a majority of the property in the district, the district board shall adopt a resolution to reduce or eliminate the portion of the tax, beginning the next fiscal year, required for one or more enhanced municipal services specified in the petition. Signatures on a petition to reduce or eliminate a tax are valid for a period of sixty days.

B. The district may not levy, other than for the payment of debt service on general obligation bonds, at a rate or rates in excess of the maximum rate then in effect.

C. When levying an ad valorem tax, the district board shall make annual statements and estimates of the operation and maintenance expenses of the district, the costs of capital improvements to be financed by the tax levy or levies and the amount of all other expenditures for public infrastructure and enhanced municipal services proposed to be paid from the tax levy or levies and of the amount to be raised to pay general obligation bonds of the district, all of which shall be provided for by the levy and collection of ad valorem taxes on the net assessed limited property value of all the real and personal property in the district. The district board shall file the annual statements and estimates with the clerk of the district. The district board shall publish a notice of the filing of the estimate, shall hold hearings on the portions of the estimate not relating to debt service on general obligation bonds and shall adopt a budget. The district board, on or before the date set by law for certifying the annual budget of the county or municipality, shall fix, levy and assess the amounts to be raised by ad valorem taxes of the district and shall cause certified copies of the order to be delivered to the board of supervisors and to the department of revenue. All statutes relating to the levy and collection of general county taxes, including the collection of delinquent taxes and sale of property for nonpayment of taxes, apply to the district taxes provided for by this section.

#### Section 48-724. Dissolution of district

A. The district may be dissolved by the district board by a resolution of the district board if the following conditions exist:

1. All of the property owned by the district has been or will be conveyed to the municipality, county or school district.

E. All property in the district, except federal, state, county and municipal property, remains subject to the lien for the payment of general obligation bonds, and any property subject to a special assessment lien remains subject to the lien notwithstanding dissolution of the district. The district may not be dissolved if any revenue bonds of the district remain outstanding unless an amount of money sufficient, together with investment income thereon, to make all payments due on the revenue bonds either at maturity or prior redemption has been deposited with a trustee or escrow agent and pledged to the payment and redemption of the bonds. The district may continue to operate after dissolution only as needed to collect money and make payments on any outstanding bonds.

#### Section 48-725. Wastewater treatment or drinking water facility and nonpoint source projects; loan repayment agreements; definitions

A. Notwithstanding any other law, a community facilities district may construct, acquire or improve a wastewater treatment facility, drinking water facility or nonpoint source project with monies borrowed from or financial assistance including forgivable principal provided by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona pursuant to title 49, chapter 8.

B. To repay a loan from the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona, a district may enter into a loan repayment agreement with the authority. A loan repayment agreement is payable from any revenues otherwise authorized by law to be used to pay long-term obligations.

C. The board of directors shall obtain approval for the loan repayment agreement in the same manner provided by law for approving and issuing other long-term obligations payable from those revenues that are to be used to pay the loan.

D. A loan repayment agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall contain the covenants and conditions pertaining to the construction, acquisition or improvement of a wastewater treatment facility, drinking water facility or nonpoint source project and repayment of the loan as the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona deems proper. Loan agreements may provide for the payment of interest on the unpaid principal balance of that agreement at the rates established in the agreement. The agreement may also provide for payment of the community facilities district's proportionate share of the expense of administering the clean water and drinking water revolving funds established by sections 49-1221 and 49-1241 and may provide that the community facilities district pay financing and loan administration fees approved by the water infrastructure finance authority. These costs may be included in the assessment amounts pledged to repay the loan. Districts are bound by and shall fully perform the loan repayment agreements, and the agreements are incontestable after the loan is funded by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona.

C. Acceptance of a discrete section of public infrastructure pursuant to this section does not modify the assurances and warranty requirements of a governing body prescribed by a municipal or county code or ordinance or as outlined in a development agreement entered into pursuant to section 9-500.05 or 11-1101.

 

#### Section 48-729. District board composition reconciliation; petition

#### Section 48-803. District administered by a district board; report

A. In a district that the board of supervisors estimates has a population of less than four thousand inhabitants, the district board may consist of three or five members. In a district that the board of supervisors estimates has a population of four thousand or more inhabitants, the district board shall consist of five members, and for a noncontiguous county island fire district formed pursuant to section 48-851, the board shall consist of five members. The estimate of population by the board of supervisors is conclusive and shall be based on available census information, school attendance statistics, election or voter registration statistics, estimates provided by state agencies or the county assessor, or other information as deemed appropriate by the board of supervisors.  If the board of supervisors determines, at any time prior to one hundred twenty days before the next regular scheduled election for members of a district board, that the population of a fire district administered by a district board consisting of three members exceeds four thousand inhabitants, estimated as provided in this section, the board of supervisors shall order an increase in the number of members of the district board. If the board of supervisors determines at any time prior to one hundred eighty days before the next regularly scheduled election for members of a district board that the population of a fire district administered by a district board that consists of five members exceeds fifty thousand inhabitants as prescribed in this section, the board of supervisors shall inform the district board that it may expand to seven members.  Any expansion to seven members shall occur by majority vote of the district board. The increase is effective for the election of the additional members at the next regular election of members of the district board.

B. If a vacancy occurs on the district board other than from expiration of a term, a quorum of the board members shall fill the vacancy by appointment of an interim member and, except for a district formed pursuant to article 3 of this chapter, a quorum of the board members shall fill the vacancy within ninety days after the date the vacancy occurs. Except for a district formed pursuant to article 3 of this chapter, if the quorum of district board members does not appoint an interim member within that ninety-day period, the board of supervisors shall appoint an interim member to the district board within sixty days after expiration of the ninety-day period, and if the district is located in more than one county, the board of supervisors of the county in which the majority of the assessed valuation of the district is located shall make the appointment after the expiration of the ninety-day period. If the entire board resigns or for any reason cannot fulfill its duties, or does not have a number of remaining board members sufficient to constitute a quorum of the board, the board of supervisors shall appoint interim district board members to fill the vacancies, or an administrator to administer the district with the same duties and obligations of the elected board to serve until the next election. A majority of the board constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business.

C. On expiration of a board member's term of office, the position is declared vacant unless otherwise filled at a general election or as provided in section 48-802, subsection D, paragraph 4. A vacancy that occurs on expiration of a term of office shall be filled by appointment by a quorum of the district board within ninety days after the first day of the beginning of the new term of office.  If the district board is unable to establish a quorum, the vacancy shall be filled by the board of supervisors as prescribed by subsection B of this section.

D. Members of the district board shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in performing duties required by law.

E. The board of a fire district shall appoint or hire a fire chief. A fire district that contracts for fire and emergency medical services may designate the fire chief of the service provider as the fire chief of the fire district.

F. The district board shall elect from its members a chairperson and a clerk. Except for a district formed pursuant to article 3 of this chapter, the election of the chairperson and the clerk must occur at the district board meeting that first occurs in the month immediately following each general election.

G. For districts formed under article 3 of this chapter, of the members first elected to district boards consisting of three members, the two people receiving the first and second highest number of votes shall be elected to four-year terms, and the person receiving the third highest number of votes shall be elected to a two-year term. Of the members first elected to district boards consisting of five members, the three people receiving the first, second and third highest number of votes shall be elected to four-year terms, and the two people receiving the fourth and fifth highest number of votes shall be elected to two-year terms.  Thereafter, the term of office of each district board member shall be four years from the first day of the month next following such member's election. Of the members elected as additional members to a five-member district board, the person with the highest number of votes is elected to a four-year term and the person with the second highest number of votes is elected to a two-year term. If a district resolves to increase the governing board to seven members pursuant to subsection A of this section, the governing board may appoint two additional members to serve until the next general election. After the general election at which the two additional members are elected, the newly elected member with the highest number of votes serves a four-year term and the other member serves a two-year term. Thereafter, the term of office for these two new members is four years.

H. For any fire district that is administered by a three-member board and that levies taxes in a fiscal year in the amount of $500,000 or more, the district must be administered by a five-member board. Beginning with the first general election held after the end of the fiscal year in which the district levied the prescribed amount, the change to a five-member board must occur as prescribed in this subsection. On levying the prescribed amount, the district may not reorganize as a three-member board regardless of any subsequent change in the district's levy. For three-person boards with a single vacancy for an existing board membership position and that are adding two additional members, the three persons with the highest number of votes are elected to a four-year term of office. For three-person boards with two vacancies for existing board membership positions and that are adding two additional members, the three persons with the first, second and third highest numbers of votes are elected to four-year terms of office and the person with the fourth highest number of votes is elected to a two-year term of office. Thereafter, all terms of office for members of these five-person boards of directors must be four years. This subsection applies to any three-member board that is expanding to a five-member board, regardless of whether the expansion is the result of the amount of the district's levy.  This subsection does not apply to districts formed under article 3 of this chapter.

I. Except for a district formed pursuant to article 3 of this chapter, all persons who are elected or appointed to a fire district board and the fire chief who is appointed or hired by the district board shall attend professional development training that is provided by an association of Arizona fire districts.  District board members and the fire chief shall complete at least six hours of professional development training, with board members completing their training within one year after the date of the certification of their election and for the fire chief, within one year after the date of hiring.  The fire district shall reimburse board members and the fire chief for the reasonable costs of the training. The professional development training must include training on open meetings laws, finance and budget matters and laws relating to fire district governance and other matters that are reasonably necessary for the effective administration of a fire district.

J. On or before December 31 of each year, the fire district association that has provided training required pursuant to subsection I of this section shall submit a report that lists the elected officials and fire chiefs who attended the training to the county board of supervisors for every county in which the fire district operates. The annual report must include at least the following:

1. A compilation of the professional development training delivered by the association pursuant to this section and the names of the fire district board members and fire chiefs who attended training as required by this section.

2. Recommendations regarding improvements to the laws of this state or to administrative actions that are required under the laws of this state pertaining to fire districts.

K. For fire district governing board members and fire chiefs who are required to attend professional development training pursuant to subsection I of this section, a fire district governing board member or fire chief who fails to complete the professional development training within the time prescribed in this section is guilty of nonfeasance in office. Any person may make a formal complaint to the county board of supervisors regarding this failure to comply, and the county board of supervisors may submit the complaint to the county attorney for possible action. The county attorney may take appropriate action to achieve compliance, including filing an action in superior court against a fire district governing board member or a fire chief for failure to comply with the professional development training requirements prescribed in this section. If the court determines that a fire district governing board member or fire chief failed to comply with the professional development training requirements prescribed in this section, the court shall issue an order removing the fire district governing board member from office or the fire chief from employment or appointment with the district. Any vacancy in the office of a fire district governing board as a result of a court order that is issued pursuant to this subsection must be filled in the manner provided by law.

#### Section 48-804. District administered by elected chief and secretary-treasurer

A. Beginning with the first term of office that commences immediately after the next regular election for that fire district after July 29, 2010, all districts that are administered by an elected chief and secretary-treasurer shall be administered by a three-member elected board of directors or a five-member elected board of directors as provided in section 48-803, subsection A and the positions of elected chief and elected secretary-treasurer no longer exist for that district and have no legal or administrative authority for and in the district. Persons elected to a three-member board of directors or a five-member board of directors pursuant to this subsection shall be designated to serve staggered terms of four years, with the initial terms of office for the three-member board or five-member board determined as prescribed in section 48-803, subsection H. Thereafter, all terms of office for members of these three-person or five-person boards of directors shall be four years.

B. A district board formed pursuant to section 48-851 shall not order an election for or issue bonds under this section.

C. Instead of publishing the notice described in subsection A of this section, the board of directors may mail a notice of election to each household containing a qualified elector of the district. The notice shall contain the same information described in subsection A of this section except that the notice shall not contain the location of all the polling places for that election.  The notice shall contain the location of the polling place for that household's qualified electors.  The notice shall be mailed at least thirty-five days before the election.

D. At the election the ballot shall contain the phrases "for the bonds" and "against the bonds".  There shall be placed a square or other designated marking space in the same manner as used for candidates on ballots.  The voter shall indicate a vote "for the bonds" or "against the bonds".  No other question, word or figure need be printed on the ballot.  The ballot need not be any particular size, nor need sample ballots be printed, posted or distributed but ballots shall comply with standards otherwise provided by law, including requirements for electronic voting, if applicable.

E. If a majority of the qualified electors of the district voting at the election approves the issuance of bonds, the district board or the elected chief and secretary-treasurer, as appropriate, may issue bonds in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the lesser of six percent of the value of the taxable property in the district as shown on the last property tax assessment roll before issuing the bonds or the maximum amount specified in the election order.

F. Bonds may be in such denominations, may be in registered or bearer form either as to principal or interest, or both, may mature at such times not exceeding the maximum maturity specified in the election order and may be subject to redemption before maturity, all as specified by the district board or elected chief and secretary-treasurer, as appropriate, as provided in subsection E of this section.  The district may engage the services of a depository to administer a book entry system for the bonds. The costs and expenses of such depository and any registrar or paying agent for the bonds shall be deemed to be interest expenses that may also be paid from the tax levy made pursuant to subsection I or J of this section.

G. Bonds shall be executed by the manual or facsimile signatures of the chairperson and clerk of the district board or elected chief and secretary-treasurer of the district.  Coupons attached to the bonds shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairperson of the district board or the elected chief of the district, as appropriate.

H. The district board may sell the bonds at public or private sale or through an online bidding process.  In addition, the district board may negotiate loan agreements or loan repayment agreements with the greater Arizona development authority in lieu of selling bonds where authority to sell bonds has been granted by the district's voters.  The proceeds of sale on the bonds shall be deposited in an account of the fire district fund to be known as the capital fund to be applied for the purpose for which the bonds were issued.

I. After the bonds are issued, the district board or elected chief and secretary-treasurer, as appropriate, shall enter on the district's minutes a record of the bonds sold and shall annually determine the amount of the tax levy to pay the bonds and certify such amount to the board of supervisors of the county.  The board of supervisors shall annually cause to be levied and collected a tax, at the same time and in the same manner as other taxes are levied and collected on all taxable property in the district, sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds as they become due and payable.  Monies derived from the levy of the tax when collected shall be deposited in the debt service fund and shall be applied only to payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds.  On payment of the outstanding bonded indebtedness of the district, any monies remaining in the debt service fund shall be used to reduce the district's property tax levy in the next fiscal year. Amounts levied for debt service on bonds issued pursuant to this section payable from the secondary tax are and shall be considered special revenues of the district, shall be kept in a special, segregated fund, are not and shall not be general property taxes and may not be used for any other purpose of the district.

J. If a district with outstanding bonded indebtedness is merged pursuant to section 48-820 or consolidated pursuant to section 48-823, the indebtedness shall not be assumed by all of the resulting district and shall be deemed an ongoing indebtedness of only that portion of the resulting district that originally approved the bonds for the purposes of subsection E of this section. In order to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds as they become due and payable, the board of supervisors shall annually cause to be levied and collected a tax on the taxable property of only that portion of the resulting district that approved the bonds as determined on the date of the merger or consolidation of the district, and may not levy taxes on the remainder of the taxable property of the newly merged or consolidated district.

K. All bonds, heretofore and hereafter issued, are secured by a lien on all revenues received pursuant to the tax levy made pursuant to subsection I or J of this section.  The lien arises automatically without the need for any action or authorization by the district or the district's governing board. The lien is valid and binding from the time of the issuance of the bonds.  The revenues received pursuant to the levy of the tax made pursuant to subsection I or J of this section are immediately subject to the lien. The lien attaches immediately to the revenues and is effective, binding and enforceable against the district, the district's successors, transferees and creditors and all other parties asserting rights in the revenues, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the lien, without the need for any physical delivery, recordation, filing or further act.

#### Section 48-807. County fire district assistance tax; annual budget; override; monthly financial reports

A. The board of supervisors of a county shall levy, at the time of levying other property taxes, a county fire district assistance tax on the taxable property in the county of not more than $.10 per $100 of assessed valuation. The tax levy provided for in this subsection shall be a levy of secondary property taxes and shall not be subject to title 42, chapter 17, article 2. The county treasurer shall pay to each fire district, including a fire district formed pursuant to section 48-851, in the county from the proceeds of the tax an amount equal to twenty percent of the property tax levy adopted by the district for the fiscal year in which the tax will be levied, except that:

1. The amount of assistance from the county to a fire district shall be reduced as follows:

(a) Through the fiscal year that ends June 30, 2012, by the dollar amount that the fire district receives from the fire district assistance tax that exceeds $300,000 from and after June 30 of each fiscal year.

(b) Beginning with the fiscal year that starts July 1, 2012, by the dollar amount that the fire district receives from the fire district assistance tax that exceeds $400,000 from and after June 30 of each fiscal year, without regard to whether the district is located in more than one county.

(c) Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this subsection, if the total amount to be paid to all districts in the county under this paragraph exceeds the amount to be raised by the levy of $.10 per $100 assessed valuation, then the county treasurer shall pay an amount less than twenty percent of the property tax levy of each district. The amount to be paid by the county treasurer to each district shall be determined by multiplying the proceeds of the county fire district assistance tax against the proportion that twenty percent of the property tax levy of each district bears to the total of twenty percent of the property tax levies of all fire districts in the county.

2. For fiscal years beginning from and after July 1, 1992, the amount of assistance from the county to a fire district shall not be less than the assistance provided from and after June 30, 1991 through June 30, 1992, if, for the fiscal year in which the tax will be levied, the district levies a tax, in addition to any tax levied under section 48-806, of $3 per $100 of assessed valuation and the assessed valuation is at least ninety percent of the assessed valuation for the 1991 tax year.  This paragraph does not apply to fire districts subject to paragraph 1, subdivision (a) or (b) of this subsection.

B. For the purpose of subsection A of this section, the property tax levy of the fire district shall include in lieu contributions pursuant to chapter 1, article 8 of this title but shall not include property tax levies to be applied to the payment of principal and interest on bonds issued pursuant to section 48-806.

D. Beginning with the fiscal year that starts July 1, 2016, for any two or more fire districts that merge or consolidate to form a consolidated district on or after July 1, 2014, the consolidated district may continue to receive monies in an amount not to exceed the sum of the average of the amount of fire district assistance tax monies received by each of the consolidating or merging districts in the five fiscal years immediately preceding the merger or consolidation as prescribed in subsection A of this section, without regard to whether the consolidated district is located in more than one county.

E. For a consolidated district that is formed in any fiscal year beginning July 1, 2014 or later and that is receiving fire district assistance tax monies that are reduced as prescribed in subsection A, paragraph 1, subdivision (c) of this section, if the total amount of fire district assistance tax monies that would be paid to all districts in the county pursuant to subsection A of this section is less than the amount of monies that would be raised by the levy of $.10 per $100 assessed valuation, the county treasurer shall pay the consolidated district the amount of fire district assistance tax monies prescribed by subsection A of this section that would have been paid to the districts at the time the districts merged or consolidated.

F. The board, based on the budget submitted by the district, shall levy, in addition to any tax levied as provided in section 48-806, a tax not to exceed $3.25 per $100 of assessed valuation through tax year 2021, $3.375 per $100 of assessed valuation for tax year 2022, $3.50 per $100 of assessed valuation for tax year 2023 and $3.75 per $100 of assessed valuation for tax year 2024 and each tax year thereafter, or the amount of the levy in the preceding tax year multiplied by 1.08, whichever levy is less, and minus any amounts required to reduce the levy pursuant to subsection I of this section, against all property situated within the district boundaries and appearing on the last assessment roll.  The levy shall be made and the taxes collected in the manner, at the time and by the officers provided by law for the collection of general county taxes.

G. The qualified electors of the district, voting in an election as prescribed by subsection H of this section, may authorize the board to levy a tax exceeding the limits prescribed by subsection F of this section under one, but not both, of the following options:

1. The electors may authorize a permanent override allowing annual levies without reference to the levy in the preceding tax year, but remaining subject to the tax rate limit of $3.25 per $100 of assessed valuation through tax year 2021, $3.375 per $100 of assessed valuation for tax year 2022, $3.50 per $100 of assessed valuation for tax year 2023 and $3.75 per $100 of assessed valuation for tax year 2024 and each tax year thereafter. An election for the purposes of this paragraph must be held at a regularly scheduled general election held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November as prescribed by section 16-204, subsection F.

2. If the net assessed valuation of all property in the district declines by a combined total of twenty percent or more over two consecutive valuation years, the electors voting at the next regularly scheduled general election held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November as prescribed by section 16-204, subsection F may authorize an override for five consecutive tax years allowing annual levies that are exempt from the tax rate limit of $3.25 through tax year 2021, $3.375 for tax year 2022, $3.50 for tax year 2023 and $3.75 for tax year 2024 and each tax year thereafter, but subject to an annual levy limit of the amount of the levy in the preceding tax year multiplied by 1.05. After the fifth tax year, the district is again subject to the limits prescribed by subsection F of this section, computed by multiplying the levy beginning in the year preceding the override by 1.08 for each year through the current tax year.

H. The call for an override election held for the purposes of subsection G of this section must state:

1. The purpose for requesting additional secondary property tax revenue for the district.

2. If the voters approve the levy:

(a) The maximum dollar amount of secondary property tax that may be collected in the first year compared to the existing maximum secondary property tax levy prescribed in subsection F of this section.

(b) The estimated secondary property tax rate to fund the proposed levy under subdivision (a) of this paragraph in the first tax year compared to the secondary property tax rate levied in the current year.

I. If the district annexes additional territory, the limit under subsection F of this section shall be adjusted by applying the district's tax rate to the assessed valuation of the annexed property in the preceding tax year. If districts are merged or consolidated under this chapter, the limitation under this subsection in the first year after the districts are merged or consolidated is the total of the levies of the merged or consolidated districts in the preceding tax year multiplied by 1.08 or the amount of the levies allowed by the maximum rate prescribed by subsection F of this section, whichever is less.

J. The district shall maintain any property tax revenues collected in excess of the sum of the amounts of taxes collectible pursuant to section 42-17054 and the allowable levy determined under subsection F of this section in a separate fund and used to reduce the property tax levy in the following tax year.

K. The levy limit under this section is considered to be increased each year to the maximum limit permissible under subsection F of this section regardless of whether the district actually levies taxes up to the maximum permissible amount in that year.

L. The county treasurer shall keep the money received from taxes levied pursuant to subsection F of this section in a separate fund known as the "fire district general fund" of the district for which collected.  Any surplus remaining in the fire district general fund at the end of the fiscal year shall be credited to the fire district general fund of the district for which it was collected for the succeeding fiscal year and after subtraction of accounts payable and encumbrances, shall be used to reduce the property tax levy in the following tax year.

M. A fire district may maintain separate accounts with a financial institution that is authorized to do business in this state for the purpose of operating a payroll account or for holding special revenues or ambulance revenues, or both, as necessary to fulfill the district's fiduciary responsibilities.

N. A fire district, through the county treasurer, shall establish the relevant governmental funds necessary for the proper management and fiscal accountability of district monies from property taxes, grants, contributions and donations, as defined by the government accounting standards board. Unless the monies received are legally restricted by contract, agreement or law, those monies may be transferred between fund accounts according to the original or amended budget of the fire district.

O. A fire district shall reconcile all balance sheet accounts for accounts for each calendar month of the fiscal year within thirty days after the end of that calendar month. The fire district board shall review the reconciled balance sheet accounts monthly, except that for a fire district that is governed by a three-member board, the board may review the reconciled balance sheet accounts every two months.

P. A fire district shall produce monthly financial reports to include a register of checks, substitute checks, warrants and deposits, a record of electronic funds transfers, a statement of financial activities and a statement of net assets for each calendar month. A fire district shall produce a cash flow projection report for each fiscal year. The cash flow projection report shall be updated monthly with the actual revenues and expenditures from the preceding month. Each month, the fire district board shall review the financial reports, the updated cash flow projections report and all month-end fund statements and reports of the preceding month to include those reports provided by the county treasurer and each of the financial institutions in which the district maintains an account, except that for a fire district that is governed by a three-member board, the board may review the reports and statements prescribed by this subsection every two months. Any financial report or cash flow projection report that would indicate that the district is likely to violate section 48-805.02, subsection D, paragraph 1 or that would indicate an adverse impact on the ongoing operations or liquidity of the district shall be reported by the fire district board chairman in writing and delivered by certified mail to the county treasurer and the county board of supervisors within ten days after the discovery.

Q. Within sixty days after submittal of a written report pursuant to subsection P of this section by the fire district board chairman to the county treasurer and the county board of supervisors that states the fire district is likely to violate section 48-805.02, subsection D, paragraph 1 or that indicates an adverse impact on the ongoing operations or liquidity of the fire district, the district shall complete a study of merger, consolidation or joint operating alternatives. The fire district shall hold a special public meeting as prescribed in section 48-805.02, subsection D to present the findings of the study. Within five days after the special public meeting, the fire district board chairman shall submit the findings of the study to the county treasurer and county board of supervisors.

R. Notwithstanding section 11-605, a fire district may register or record warrants, substitute checks or electronic funds transfers only if separate accounts are maintained by the county treasurer for each governmental fund of a fire district. Warrants, substitute checks or electronic funds transfers may be registered or recorded only on the maintenance and operation account, the unrestricted capital outlay account and the special revenue account, and only if the total cash balance of all three accounts is insufficient to pay the warrants, substitute checks or electronic funds transfers and after any revolving line of credit has been expended as prescribed in section 11-635.

S.

H. Before considering any resolution of merger pursuant to this section, the governing body of each affected district shall obtain written consent to the merger from any single taxpayer residing within each of the affected districts who owns thirty percent or more of the net assessed valuation of the total net assessed valuation of the district as of the date the district's resolution is submitted to the board of supervisors.

Not more than three members shall be appointed from the same fire district board.  If the merger affects only two fire districts, the fire district with the largest net assessed valuation shall appoint three members to the governing body of the newly merged district and the district with the lesser net assessed valuation shall appoint two members.  Subsequent terms of office for district board members shall be filled by election of board members who shall be qualified electors of the merged district.

Except as provided in subsection F or H of this section, the board of supervisors shall make an order calling for an election to decide whether to consolidate two or more fire districts when a resolution for consolidation of fire districts from each district is submitted to the board of supervisors.  The board of supervisors shall not make an order calling for an election to consolidate the same fire districts more frequently than once every two years.  Whether or not the districts are consolidated, the participating fire districts are each liable to reimburse the counties for the expenses of the election, including the cost of mailing any notices.  If the proposed district is located in more than one county, the resolutions shall be submitted to the board of supervisors of the county in which the majority of the assessed valuation of the proposed district is located as of the date of the adoption of the earliest resolution that called for the consolidation. The words appearing on the ballot shall be "(insert fire districts' names) consolidate as a fire district-–yes" and "(insert fire districts' names) consolidate as fire district-–no."

B. Within fourteen days after the election, the board of supervisors shall meet and canvass the returns, and if it is determined that a majority of the votes cast at the election in each of the affected districts is in favor of consolidating the fire districts, the board shall enter that fact on its minutes.

C. Except as prescribed by subsection D of this section, a fire district may consolidate with one or more other fire districts formed pursuant to section 48-261 as follows:

The requesting district shall send by first class mail the notice of request to consolidate districts to the fire district in which the consolidation is requested.

2. On receipt of the resolution requesting consolidation, and on approval by majority vote of the governing body receiving the request, two or more fire districts may consolidate if the governing body of each affected fire district by a majority vote of the members of each governing body adopts a resolution declaring that a consolidation be considered and a public hearing be held to determine if a consolidation would be in the best interest of the districts and would promote the public safety, health, comfort, convenience, necessity or welfare.  The governing body of each district that adopts a resolution calling for a public hearing by first class mail shall send notice of the day, hour and place of a hearing on the proposed consolidation to each owner of taxable property within the boundaries of the district.

The chairperson of the board of supervisors shall order a review of the proposed consolidation and may submit written comments to the governing body of each fire district located in the county within ten days after receipt of the notice.

4. At the hearing held as prescribed by paragraph 2 of this subsection, the governing body of the district shall consider the comments of the board of supervisors, hear those persons who appear for or against the proposed consolidation and determine whether the proposed consolidation will promote the public safety, health, comfort, convenience, necessity or welfare. If, after the public hearing, each of the governing bodies of the districts affected by the proposed consolidation adopt a resolution by a majority vote that the consolidation will promote the public safety, health, comfort, convenience, necessity or welfare, each of the governing bodies of the districts affected by the proposed consolidation shall submit the resolutions calling for an election to the board of supervisors.

5. If the proposal for consolidation is approved as provided in subsections A and B of this section or is approved as provided in subsection F or H of this section, the governing body of the district into which consolidation was requested shall by resolution declare the districts consolidated and each affected district joined.

4. The clerk of the board of supervisors shall mail, by first class mail, written notice of the day, hour and place of the hearing on the proposed district to each owner of taxable property within the boundaries of the proposed district.  The written notice shall state the purpose of the hearing and shall state where a copy of the impact statement may be viewed or requested. The clerk of the board of supervisors shall post the notice in at least three conspicuous public places in the area of the proposed district and shall publish twice in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area of the proposed district, at least ten days before the hearing, or, if no daily newspaper of general circulation exists in the area of the proposed district, at least twice at any time before the date of the hearing, a notice stating the purpose of the proposed district formation, the description of the area of the proposed district and the day, hour and place of the hearing.

D. A district organized pursuant to this section shall have an organizing board of directors to administer the affairs of the district until a duly constituted board of directors is elected as provided in this title. The organizing board has all the powers, duties and responsibilities of an elected board.

If a vacancy occurs on the organizing board, the remaining board members shall fill the vacancy by appointing an interim member.  Members of the organizing board shall serve without compensation but may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred in performing their duties. The organizing board shall elect from its members a chairperson and a clerk. For any challenge to the formation of the district, the district board is a proper party to the challenge and any petition circulators are not proper parties.

E. Notwithstanding subsections A, B, C and D of this section, an alternate form of a noncontiguous county island fire district may be established if a fire district organized pursuant to section 48-261 that is surrounded by incorporated areas in a county and that contracts for fire protection services from an adjacent municipality receives approval from the county board of supervisors to re-form as a noncontiguous county island fire district that operates pursuant to this article as follows:

4. On receipt of notice from the district board and after providing any information that the county board of supervisors deems relevant or necessary, the county board of supervisors shall determine whether the fire district may re-form as a noncontiguous county island fire district.  The decision of the county board of supervisors is final.

5. If the county board of supervisors approves the re-formation of the district, that re-formation is effective and the fire district is re-formed as a noncontiguous county island fire district sixty days after the date of approval.

6. The re-formed noncontiguous county island fire district retains all existing board members and their terms of office, its taxing authority and fund balances and its contracts, assets and liabilities. The re-formed noncontiguous county island fire district does not constitute a new or separate legal entity but is deemed a continuation of the previous legal entity.

7. On completion of the re-formation of the fire district, the county board of supervisors may assign the territory of the fire district to a municipal planning area solely for the purpose of contracting for fire protection services.

F. For the purposes of this article, "noncontiguous county island fire district" means a district that is formed pursuant to this section and for which either:

Notwithstanding any other law, a county improvement district, including a domestic wastewater improvement district, may construct or improve a wastewater treatment facility, sewer collection system, waterworks, including a drinking water treatment facility, or nonpoint source project or any combination of those projects with monies borrowed from or financial assistance provided by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona pursuant to title 49, chapter 8.

B. To repay financial assistance from the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona, a county improvement district, including a domestic wastewater improvement district, may enter into a financial assistance loan repayment agreement with the authority to repay any financial assistance provided by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona.  A financial assistance loan repayment agreement is payable from any revenues otherwise authorized by law to be pledged to repay long-term indebtedness. A financial assistance loan repayment agreement may be secured either by assessments or by a pledge of revenues of the district or any combination of those sources. If the financial assistance loan repayment agreement is secured in whole or in part by assessments levied pursuant to this article, the financial assistance loan repayment agreement shall be treated as a series of bonds to the extent that they are secured by those assessments and the board of directors of the district has all powers and duties to collect assessment installments and enforce delinquent assessments through sale and eventual issuance of deeds in the same manner as if the assessments were evidenced by bonds.

C. The board of directors of the district shall obtain approval for the financial assistance loan repayment agreement in the same manner provided by law for approving and issuing bonds or other long-term indebtedness that is secured by those assessments or revenues or a combination of assessments and revenues that are to be pledged to repay the loan.

D. A financial assistance loan repayment agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall contain the covenants and conditions pertaining to constructing a wastewater treatment facility, sewer collection system, waterworks, including a drinking water treatment facility, or nonpoint source project or any combination of those projects and repaying the loan as the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona deems proper. Financial assistance loan repayment agreements may provide for paying interest on the unpaid principal balance of the agreement at the rates established in the agreement. The agreement may also provide for paying the district's proportionate share of the expenses of administering the clean water revolving fund established by section 49-1221 and may provide that the district pay financing and loan administration fees approved by the water infrastructure authority of Arizona. These costs may be included in the assessment and revenue amounts pledged to repay the financial assistance loan repayment agreement. Districts are bound by and shall fully perform the financial assistance loan repayment agreements, and the agreements are incontestable after the loan is funded by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona. The district shall also agree to pay the authority's costs in issuing bonds or otherwise borrowing to fund a loan.

E. The water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona shall not require that payment of a financial assistance loan repayment agreement be made from other than those sources permitted in subsection B of this section. The financial assistance loan repayment agreement may also include covenants concerning the operation of the system, the setting of rates and provisions for the appointment of a receiver to take charge of and operate a sewer collection system, a waterworks, including a drinking water treatment facility, and a wastewater treatment system if the financial assistance loan repayment agreement is not paid in a timely manner and, in the sole discretion of the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona, if the district will not be able to cure the default.

F. A district may employ or contract for the services of attorneys, accountants, financial consultants and other experts in their fields as deemed necessary to perform services with respect to the financial assistance loan repayment agreement. These costs are incidental expenses and shall be included in any assessments.

G. This section is supplemental and alternative to any other law under which a district may borrow monies or issue bonds. This section is not the exclusive authorization to enter into loan agreements with the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona.

H. A district may borrow additional monies or enter into additional financial assistance loan repayment agreements with the water infrastructure finance authority in an amount up to the amount approved pursuant to subsection C of this section less the amount that the district is obligated to repay to the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona pursuant to a financial assistance loan repayment agreement.

I. For the purposes of this section, "nonpoint source project" has the same meaning prescribed in section 49-1201.

#### Section 48-909.02. Multijurisdictional entities; limitation of district liability and responsibility

A. Any county improvement district may join with any other person or entity in the creation of a multijurisdictional entity to further the acquisition, construction, operation or maintenance of any of the improvements that are authorized by this article and shall establish the duties and responsibilities of each party in a written operating agreement. The agreement shall state the share of the costs to be borne by the district and by each other party to the agreement. The district's share may be based on any objective criteria that are established in the agreement. The district shall not become liable without its written consent for more than its agreed on share of the cost of construction, operation or maintenance of the improvement or for claims for tortious action, environmental responsibility or any damage proximately caused by the construction, operation or maintenance of the improvement. Any share of liability agreed on in the written operating agreement is the limit of the district's liability without regard to the insolvency or bankruptcy or other inability or unwillingness of any other party to perform its obligations or to pay its proportionate share of those obligations.

B. Costs that are incurred by a person in forming an improvement district that becomes a member of a multijurisdictional entity, including reasonable costs incurred in circulating petitions to form a district, shall be reimbursed by the district and shall be included as incidental expenses of the district.

C. Any county improvement district that is located in a county with a population of less than two hundred thousand persons according to the most recent United States decennial census may purchase an interest in any improvement that is authorized by section 48-909. The district may acquire joint, several or joint and several interests in the improvement.

D. Any multijurisdictional entity that is formed pursuant to this section may enter into a loan repayment agreement with the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona in the same manner as a county improvement district that is acting pursuant to section 48-909.01. Any loan repayment agreement that is executed between the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona and a multijurisdictional entity shall also limit the district's repayment obligation to its share as stated in the written operating agreement. This limitation may be evidenced by written acceptance of the district's liabilities and obligations under the loan repayment agreement between the authority and the multijurisdictional entity or by a separate loan repayment agreement or by the delivery of the county improvement district's bonds to the authority to secure the district's obligations under the multijurisdictional entity's loan repayment agreement.

#### Section 48-910. Domestic water and domestic wastewater services; authority to set fees; liens; foreclosure

A. The board of directors of a domestic water improvement district, a domestic wastewater improvement district or a county improvement district that provides or is established for the purpose of providing water or wastewater services shall have the authority to set fees for the district following a public hearing. Fees may include any of the following:

1. User fees that are proportionate shares of the cost of operation, maintenance and replacement of a water delivery system, a water disposal system or a wastewater treatment and disposal system or any combination of those systems, including a system for the treatment and use of effluent, and may include the cost of administrators, surveyors, sanitation experts, engineers, legal counsel and other persons as are reasonably necessary for the operation, maintenance and replacement of the systems. The fees may also include any contractual amounts required to meet covenants relating to bonds or other obligations of the district secured by a pledge of, or promise to pay from, the district's fees.

2. Hookup fees for connection to the district water or wastewater system, not including the cost of the actual physical connection.

3. Lateral fees for the cost of constructing a water or wastewater lateral from the property line of the user to the middle of the easement or right-of-way in which the water system or wastewater system is located.

4. For a domestic wastewater improvement district or a county improvement district that provides or is established for the purpose of providing wastewater systems or services, either of the following:

(a) A capacity fee based on the cost of developing the wastewater collection, treatment and disposal facilities that are required to treat the flows into the system from a particular wastewater connection.

(b) An availability fee that is charged on all property in the district that is not connected to the existing wastewater treatment system but that is adjacent to a wastewater line and that is based on the cost of having the wastewater line and treatment facility capacity to accommodate that property if it is developed. An availability fee is limited to fifty per cent of the user fee.

B. Notice announcing the hearing shall be posted in not less than three places within the district for not less than ten days before the date of the hearing and shall be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation within the district.  The newspaper publications shall be not less than one week apart, and the first publication shall be not less than ten days before the date of the hearing.  The district may also mail notice of the hearing to all district customers.  The notice may be included in the district's regular billings and shall be mailed at least ten days before the date of the hearing.

C. The board of supervisors shall be notified by mail of the hearing not less than ten days before the date of the hearing. The board of supervisors may be represented at the hearing and may advise the board of directors.

D. At the hearing all interested district property owners and customers may appear and be heard on any matter relating to the establishment of the proposed fees. Any person wishing to object to the establishment of the proposed fees, before the date set for the hearing, may file objections with the chairman or the clerk of the board of directors.

E. A domestic water improvement district, domestic wastewater improvement district or a county improvement district that provides or is established for the purpose of providing water or wastewater systems or services may file a lien on property for the nonpayment of user fees for services provided to the property if the fees are delinquent for more than ninety days. At least thirty days before filing the lien, the district shall provide written notice to the owner of the property and shall include notice of an opportunity for a hearing before a designated officer of the district. The notice of lien shall be personally served on the property owner or mailed by certified mail to the property owner's last known address or to the address to which the most recent property tax assessment was mailed. If the property owner does not reside on the property, the notice shall be mailed by certified mail to the owner's last known address.

F. The unpaid user fees are a lien on the property from the date of recording in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the property is located until the fees and all costs are paid. The lien is subject and inferior to the lien for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages and encumbrances of record. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien assessed pursuant to this section shall be made on a judgment of foreclosure and order of sale. A domestic water or domestic wastewater improvement district or a county improvement district that provides or is established for the purpose of providing water or wastewater systems or services may bring an action to foreclose the lien in the superior court in the county in which the property is located any time after recording. Failure to foreclose the lien does not affect its validity.  The recorded unpaid user fees are prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited in the recording and of the regularity of all proceedings before the recording.

G. Unpaid user fees pursuant to this section accrue interest at the rate prescribed by section 44-1201.

H. The district shall add all costs incurred by the district, including interest, attorney fees and costs in filing and enforcing the lien, to the unpaid user fees, and the costs are a liability of the property owner payable from the proceeds of the sale.

I. A prior assessment of unpaid user fees pursuant to this section does not bar a subsequent assessment pursuant to this section, and any number of liens on the same parcel of property may be enforced in the same action.

J. A district shall not file a lien for unpaid user fees against a residential property that is occupied by a lessee and at which the lessee is responsible for payment of the user fees. The district shall determine the status of leased residential property before filing the lien.

 

#### Section 48-911. Rights of way within district; improvements and maintenance

A. All streets, lanes, alleys, places, courts, avenues, boulevards, highways, crossings, intersections, public ways and grounds in an improvement district organized under this article, which are open to the public use or dedicated to public use by a plat of record or otherwise, shall be deemed to be public and subject to improvement and maintenance under this article. The board of directors of the district may order to be done thereon any work or improvement mentioned in this article, but no provision of this article or any proceeding or improvement had or made under this article shall be held to impose on the county the duty of maintaining the same as county roads or highways unless and until the county takes them over as county roads or highways by appropriate resolution to that effect.

B. If there are in any such district public roads or highways which are maintained by the county, the county roads or highways may be improved by the district under the provisions of this article and in that case the resolution of intention for the improvement shall state what portion, if any, of the cost of the improvement will be paid by the county and to what extent the county will maintain the public road or highway after the improvement is made, but the portion, if any, of the cost of the improvement to be paid for by the county shall be included in the assessment and may be paid for in cash, or the amount thereof may be included in any bonds issued for the improvement, and, if so included, the assessment shall bear the same interest and be payable by the district in installments, as assessments against property of private persons. The district, however, may contract with the county for the payment to the district of such assessment and interest as may become due and payable, and the county shall perform the contract.

#### Section 48-912. Resolution of intention to order improvement

A. Before ordering an improvement authorized by this article that will result in an assessment against one or more lots within the district, the board of directors of the district shall pass a resolution of intention briefly describing the improvement. By the resolution of intention and the subsequent proceedings, one or more of the improvements may be made on one or more streets or any portion of any street and shall constitute one improvement and be constructed under one contract. If any such work is already done for any lot, the lot shall be excepted from that assessment to the extent of the work done.

B. When the proposed improvement in the opinion of the board of directors is of more than local or ordinary public benefit, it may order the expense of the improvement chargeable upon an assessment district, and shall describe the extent of such assessment district in general terms in its resolution of intention, either by reference to street lines or block numbers, or by designating its exterior boundaries by their courses and distances from the street or streets the improvement of which is contemplated, and may refer for a more particular description of the district to a map on file with the district engineer, showing the exterior boundary lines of the assessment district, and delineating block and lot numbers or containing such details as will show the location of the lines.

C. The board of directors in the resolution of intention may provide that the improvement described in the resolution may be made according to any of several alternative plans and specifications, methods, classes or kinds of construction or classes or kinds of material to be determined by the board of directors.

#### Section 48-913. District engineer; appointment; compensation

A qualified engineer shall be appointed or employed as district engineer and his compensation fixed by the board of directors. Claims of the engineer for compensation or expenses, approved by the board of directors, may be paid out of the county general fund, and the general fund shall be reimbursed out of the funds of the district.

#### Section 48-914. Preliminary plans; estimate of cost; limitation on assessment

Before passing the resolution of intention, the engineer shall prepare preliminary plans that show the location and the type and character of the proposed improvements and estimates of the cost and expenses of the proposed improvements and shall file the preliminary plans with the clerk. The assessment for any lot shall not exceed its proportion of the estimate.

 

#### Section 48-915. Petition to incur expense; sufficiency

A. Before incurring any expenses for which the district may become liable and that will result in an assessment against one or more lots within the district, the board of directors shall require that there be filed with the clerk a petition signed by property owners as provided by this section.

B. The petition may consist of one or more like or similar instruments filed with the clerk.  The sufficiency of the signatures shall be determined by the rules prescribed for determining the sufficiency of protests against the improvement.

C. The petition may be accepted as sufficient by the board of directors if it or its several parts have attached the affidavit of a property owner whose property is subject to assessment for the improvement, stating on oath that the property owner has examined the petition and that the signatures are the genuine signatures of the owners of a majority of the frontage of the property fronting on the proposed improvement or, if the cost of the improvement is proposed to be made chargeable upon an assessment district, the owners of a majority of the frontage of property contained within the limit of the assessment district.

D. Notwithstanding subsection C, if the board of supervisors of a county finds that a proposed assessment by the district is a matter of public health, welfare and safety and on a showing that a reasonable effort has been made by first class mail to contact absentee owners, the board of directors may accept the petition as sufficient if it is signed by the majority of resident and responding absentee owners, as determined by the board of directors, of a majority of the frontage of the property fronting on the proposed improvement or contained within the district, as the case may be. Mailed petitions shall provide for either acceptance or rejection by the owner and shall include a notice stating that only returned petitions will be counted. The absentee owners who are contacted by first class mail have thirty days from the date the mail is postmarked to return the petition. The maximum amount of the proposed assessment under petitions authorized by this subsection shall be no more than one dollar fifty cents per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation.

#### Section 48-916. Notice of resolution

A. The district shall mail to the owners of all real property within the area to be assessed a notice that contains the following:

1. A notice of the passage of the resolution of intention with the date of the resolution of intention.

2. A description of the work to be performed and the property to be assessed.

3. The total amount of the engineer's estimate of costs and expenses of the work.

4. A description of the board's intention to levy assessments and issue bonds, as applicable.

B. The notice shall be mailed to owners based on the names and addresses that appear on the most recent property tax assessment roll.

#### Section 48-917. Protest against proposed improvement; protest as bar to improvement proceedings; objection to extent of assessment district

A. The owners of a majority of the frontage of the property fronting on the area of the proposed improvement, or, when the cost of improvement has been made chargeable upon a district, the owners of a majority of the acreage of property contained within the limits of the assessment district, may make a written protest against the improvement within twenty days after the date of the mailing of the notice of the passage of the resolution of intention.

B. The protest shall show a description of the property and the amount of the frontage or acreage, as applicable, owned by each signer together with his post office address. The protest shall be filed with the clerk who shall endorse thereon the date of delivery to him. Protests so delivered and endorsed, if sufficient, shall be a bar to any further proceedings in making the improvement for six months from the date the protest is filed, unless the owners of one-half or more of the frontage or acreage, as applicable, meanwhile petition for the work to be done. No portion of the improvement included in any proceeding barred by the protest shall be included within a new proceeding within six months from filing the protest unless the owners of one-half or more of the frontage or acreage, as applicable, petition for the work to be included in the new proceeding.

C. When the cost of the improvement has been made chargeable upon an assessment district, objections to the extent of the district to be assessed to pay the expenses of the improvement may be made by an owner in the assessment district within the time provided for the filing of protests against the work. The objections shall show the amount of frontage owned by each signer and his post office address.

D. When an objection to the extent of the proposed assessment district has been filed, the board of directors shall fix a time for hearing the protest, and the clerk shall notify the objectors by mail of the address given by each objector of the date of the hearing at least ten days prior thereto.

E. At the hearing, which may be adjourned, the board of directors shall hear and pass upon the objections, and its decisions shall be final and conclusive. The board may modify the extent of the proposed assessment district, in which event a new resolution of intention shall be passed containing a description of the modified assessment district, which shall be published, and notices thereof posted as required of an original resolution of intention.

#### Section 48-918. Procedure for making and hearing protests and objections

A. In determining protests and objections, the board of directors shall be guided by these rules:

1. Each paper containing signatures shall have attached thereto the affidavit of an owner to be assessed, stating that each signature was affixed in his presence and is the signer's genuine signature.

2. The protest or objection shall be counted only for the property described as belonging to the signer, and a signature without the description shall not be counted.

3. The signature of one cotenant or, if community property, the signature of either spouse, is sufficient for a protest if no objection to the signature is made by the other cotenant or spouse. If such an objection is made, the protest shall be counted only to the extent of the signer's interest in the property.

4. A protest or objection signed by a guardian, conservator, personal representative, administrator or trustee is valid without an order of court therefor.

5. A protest or objection by a person in possession under contract of purchase is valid.

6. When several persons have a claim to or an interest in property, the signature of any of them is sufficient unless questioned by another having such claim or interest, whereupon the wishes of the person legally entitled to possession of the property at the date of the protest shall control.

7. A protest or objection signed by an agent or attorney in fact shall be disregarded unless the authority of the agent has been recorded with the county recorder, or written or telegraphic authority is attached to the protest or objection before expiration of the time for filing the protest or objection.

8. A signature may be withdrawn from a protest or objection by filing the withdrawal with the clerk in his office at or before five o'clock p.m. of the last day set for the filing of protests.

9. An objection to the signature of a cotenant, spouse, claimant or person interested may be filed, and the authority of an agent or attorney in fact questioned, at any time before the board of directors finally passes upon the sufficiency of the protest, but an agency or authority may not be revoked as to the signature after the expiration of the protest period.

B. The board of directors may fix a date for a hearing upon the sufficiency of a protest, which shall be within thirty days from the expiration of the protest period, and shall give notice of the hearing by publication twice in a daily, or once in a weekly or semiweekly paper published or circulated in the district or county, and by mailing the notice to each protestant at his address of record.

C. The notice shall require all persons signing the protest or their agents or attorneys to appear and show cause why the protest should not be overruled.

D. At the hearing the board of directors may disregard all signatures of which the right to sign does not appear upon the records of the county recorder, and which are not supported by evidence at the hearing.

#### Section 48-919. Resolution ordering improvement; notice; bids

A. When no protests against the proposed work or no objections as to the extent of the proposed assessment district have been filed within the time specified, or when a protest is found by the board of directors to be insufficient, or when the objections to the extent of the proposed district have been heard and denied, the board of directors may order, by resolution, the proposed improvements described in the resolution of intention.

B. The resolution need not fully describe the improvement nor the extent of the assessment district, but may refer to the resolution of intention for such description.

C. The superintendent shall then publish a notice of the passage of the resolution ordering the work, and inviting sealed bids for making the improvement therein ordered, twice in one or more daily newspapers or once in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper, published and circulated in the county in which the district is located, and shall post a copy of the notice for five days on or near the door of the meeting place of the board of directors. The notice shall state the time within which proposals may be filed with the clerk, which shall not be less than ten days from the date of the first publication of the notice.

D. When in the resolution of intention the board of directors has provided for alternative plans and specifications, the invitation for bids for making the improvement may require separate bids according to each of the several alternative plans and specifications.

#### Section 48-920. Assessment of public property; no rescission

A. When a lot belonging to the United States, the state, a county, city or school district or any political subdivision or institution of the state or county fronts upon the proposed work or improvement, or is included within the assessment district declared by the board of directors in its resolution of intention to be the district to be assessed to pay the costs and expenses thereof, the board of directors shall, in the resolution of intention, declare whether or not such lot shall be omitted from the assessment thereafter to be made.

B. If the lot is omitted from the assessment, the total expense of all work done shall be assessed on the remaining lots fronting on the work or improvement, or lying within the assessment district, without regard to the omitted lot.

C. If the board of directors declares the lot included in the assessment, or if no declaration is made respecting the lot, the district shall be liable for and shall pay such sum as thereafter may be assessed against the lot. The amount of the assessment levied against the lot may be included in any bonds issued for the improvement, and if so included, the assessments shall bear the same interest, and be payable by the district in installments, as assessments against property of private persons.

D. The district may contract with the state, or body to which the lot belongs, for payment to the district of the assessment and interest as it becomes due and payable, and the state, or such body, shall perform the contract.

E. Any city, town, county, school district or other political subdivision of a county or this state shall not rescind or otherwise take or continue any action to terminate an agreement to pay or otherwise support an assessment levied pursuant to this article until all assessments are fully paid. An agreement is deemed to support an assessment if it provides for the sale of property to a district that was financed in whole or in part with assessments levied pursuant to this article or with revenues generated by bonds issued pursuant to this article.

#### Section 48-921. Payment of costs from other sources

A. When any money is available from the county, or a state or federal agency, or the general fund of the district, or from any other source, for paying the cost of the whole or any part of any of the work provided for in the resolution of intention, the board of directors may in the resolution of intention or in any resolution adopted before the assessment is finally approved, order that such money be applied to the whole or any portion of the improvements for which it is available and direct the remainder of the costs and expenses to be assessed proportionately on the lots liable to be assessed for such improvement.

B. In addition to any payments made as prescribed by subsection A of this section, a district may be financed from the following sources of revenue:

1. Proceeds received from the sale of bonds of the district.

2. Monies of the county that are contributed to the district.

3. State or federal grants.

4. Private contributions.

5. Any other monies available to the district by law.

 

#### Section 48-922. Bids; bond; award of contract

A. Bids shall be submitted accompanied by a bond payable to the district, for an amount not less than ten per cent of the aggregate proposal. Alternative bids may be accompanied by one bond at least equal to ten per cent of the amount of the highest proposal submitted.

B. The board of directors shall, in open session, open, examine and publicly declare the bids, and may reject any or all when deemed for the public good, and shall reject all bids other than the lowest and best bid of a responsible bidder. The board may award the contract for the work or improvement to the lowest and best responsible bidder at the price named in his bid, upon motion, noted in its minutes, and upon a majority vote of its members.

C. When the resolution of intention to make the improvement and the resolution ordering the work has provided for alternative plans and specifications, and the notice has invited separate bids in accordance with alternative plans and specifications, the board of directors shall not award the contract for the improvement until fifteen days after the bids have been opened, examined and declared. If within such period the owners of a majority of the frontage of property fronting on the proposed improvement, or, when the cost of the improvement has been made chargeable upon an assessment district, the owners of a majority of the frontage of property contained within the limits of the assessment district, in writing require that the proposed improvement be constructed in accordance with any particular one of the alternative plans and specifications, then the board of directors shall so determine and require, and shall award the contract to the lowest and best responsible bidder. If no such written requirement is filed, then the board of directors shall determine which of the alternative plans and specifications shall be adopted, considering the cost and efficiency thereof, and shall award the contract accordingly.

#### Section 48-923. Notice of award; objection to proceedings; entering into contract; liability on bond

A. Notice of the award of contract shall be published twice in a daily newspaper or once in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper, published and of general circulation in the county within which the district is located.

B. At any time within fifteen days from the date of the first publication, any person having an interest in a lot liable to assessment, claiming that any of the previous acts or proceedings relating to the improvement are irregular, illegal or faulty, may file with the clerk a written notice specifying in what respect the acts and proceedings are irregular, illegal or faulty, and all objections to any act or proceeding which are not made prior to the notice of award shall be waived, except as to matters directly affecting the authority of the board of directors. If the board of directors finds any objection well taken, it may abandon the proceedings, or correct or modify any portion thereof, and proceed as in the first instance.

C. Within twenty days after the date of the first publication, if no objections have been filed, the successful bidder shall enter into a contract to make the improvement according to his bid. If objections are filed but are rejected by the board of directors, the contract shall be entered into within five days after receiving notice from the clerk of such rejection. If the bidder fails to enter into the contract within such period, then the board of directors without further proceedings shall again advertise for bids as in the first instance, and the bidder shall be liable upon his bond accompanying the bid for all costs and damages incurred and sustained by reason of the failure to enter into the contract.

#### Section 48-924. Form and execution of contract; supervision of performance; default; new bids; delivery of assessment

A. The superintendent of streets shall make all written contracts and receive all bonds authorized by this article. The contract shall require the contractor to timely repair any defects in the work determined to exist within one year after completion of the contract. The contracts shall specify a reasonable time for the completion of the improvement.

B. The board of directors may prescribe a form of contract not inconsistent with this article and fix a reasonable time for the completion of the work, which may be extended from time to time by the superintendent.

C. The work shall be done pursuant to contract and under the direction of the superintendent, but the board of directors may prescribe rules and regulations relating to the supervision of the work. The superintendent may appoint a suitable person to take charge of and superintend the construction of an improvement who shall see that the contract is fulfilled. The board of directors shall fix the compensation to be allowed such person.

D. If the work is not prosecuted with diligence, the board of directors, after a hearing on notice mailed or personally served on the contractor, the contractor's surety and all persons shown as the owners of property affected by the assessments as their names and addresses appear on the last certified property tax roll, may prescribe such terms and conditions as it deems proper before allowing the contractor to continue with the work if the board of directors determines that the contractor is capable of continuing the work. The determination of the board of directors shall be final and conclusive, and the determination may be reviewed only by a special action. Any such action shall be given priority by the court. The board of directors may cause a reporter's transcript to be made of the hearing. Such transcript, when made and certified and filed with the clerk, shall be the official record of the hearing. On request by the contractor, the surety, any owner or the superintendent of streets, the board of directors may issue subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum directed to any witness desired by any party to the hearing. The subpoena shall have the same effect as subpoenas in civil actions. If the subpoena is not obeyed, the board of directors, on a majority vote of its members, may cite the disobedient party for contempt and certify such action to the superior court. The superior court shall act on such citation in the same manner as other cases of civil contempt.

E. If the board of directors finds that the contractor is unable to continue with the work or to perform the work according to the contract or has not performed the work according to the contract, the board of directors shall hold the contractor in default and make demand on the surety to act in accordance with the contract and terms and conditions of the performance bond. If the surety fails to act within sixty days after receiving written notice, the board of directors may order that bids be received from other contractors to complete the work. After receiving bids, the board of directors may award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder. If, after receiving the new bids, the cost of completion exceeds the monies or bonds available for payment, the board of directors shall make a demand on the defaulting contractor's surety for payment of the difference within twenty days after the mailing of the notice. If the surety is represented by an attorney-in-fact, the demand may be served on the attorney-in-fact or at the surety's principal office within this state. If the surety has no attorney-in-fact and no principal office within this state, the demand shall be served on the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions. The demand may not exceed the penal sum of the performance bond. Monies collected from the surety shall be used to pay the added costs of the work. The district shall advance any difference between the actual costs of the work and the amount assessed and shall use its contingency fund or any other available monies to make payments to the new contractor. The district shall reimburse itself from the amounts paid by the former contractor or surety or from assessments and bonds when monies become available. All additional costs of the work not received from the original contractor or such contractor's surety may be assessed against the benefiting parcels of property if the board of directors finds that such action is necessary both to prevent a default on the district's bonds and to complete the work.

F. If the contractor is not to be paid pursuant to section 48-935, subsection G or section 48-962, subsection F, on completion of the work the contractor is entitled to the issuance and delivery of the assessment as provided by this article.

G. This section governs over any other law. Notwithstanding any other law, the contractor and the surety shall not be paid interest on amounts due during any period of contract suspension or termination unless the findings of the board of directors are arbitrary and capricious.

#### Section 48-925. Bonds required from contractor

The contractor shall, before executing the contract, file with the superintendent such bond or bonds as required under the provisions of title 34, chapter 2, article 2.

#### Section 48-926. Cost of publications

A. Before the contract is entered into, the bidder to whom the award was made shall advance to the superintendent of streets, for payment by him, the costs of publication of the notices, resolutions, orders and other expenses required under the proceedings provided for by this article.

B. If the work is abandoned by the district before letting the contract, the costs incurred previous to the abandonment shall be paid by the district.

#### Section 48-927. Diagrams of property affected; estimate of benefits; assessment; warrant; lien

A. The district engineer shall make duplicate diagrams of the property fronting upon the proposed work or improvement, or contained within the assessment district when the expenses of the proposed improvement are to be assessed upon a district. The diagrams shall show each separate lot, numbered consecutively, the approximate area in square feet of each lot, and the location of the lot in relation to the work proposed to be done.

B. When the diagrams have been approved by the board of directors, and the clerk has certified that fact and the date of approval, the diagrams shall be delivered to the superintendent of streets.

C. At any time after bids are received for the construction of the work or the district enters into a contract to purchase an existing facility, the superintendent shall estimate on the lots fronting on the work when no district has been established, or, when an assessment district has been established, upon each of the lots within the district, the benefits arising or expected to arise from the work. The superintendent shall then make an assessment to cover the sum due for the work performed and specified in the bid of the person to whom the contract was awarded, and in addition, the incidental expenses, and shall assess upon and against the lots the total amount of the costs and expenses of such work. In so doing the superintendent shall assess the total sum upon the several lots, each respectively in proportion to the benefits to be received by each lot.

D. When the work has not been declared by the resolution of intention to be of more than local or ordinary public benefit, and has not been made assessable upon an assessment district, the lots liable to be assessed for the improvement shall be those fronting upon the street or streets improved, and those situated in the quarter blocks and irregular blocks adjoining and cornering upon the crossings, or where there is a termination in the two quarter blocks adjoining and cornering on the lots, halfway to the next main street crossing and all the way to a boundary line of the district when no cross street intervenes.

E. The assessment shall cover the sum due for the work performed or to be performed as specified in the bid of the person to whom the contract was awarded, and in addition, all incidental expenses. The incidental expenses shall include the compensation of the district engineer for work done by him, the cost of printing, advertising and posting, the compensation of the person appointed by the superintendent to take charge of and superintend the work of constructing the improvements and the expenses of making and administering the assessment, any discount on the bonds, any paying agent's fees, interest on the bonds for a period not longer than the expected period of construction and six months beyond and all legal and financial fees, expenses and costs incurred in the drafting of the proceedings and in the sale of the bonds. The amount of all such incidental expenses shall be settled and allowed by the superintendent upon verified itemized bills.

F. The assessment shall briefly refer to the award of the contract or to the contract if it has then been executed and shall name the person to whom the contract has been awarded and such person's surety, and the amount to be paid as stated in the winning bid or as finally computed by the engineer, if the assessment is not made until the work is completed, together with the incidental expenses, the amount of each assessment, the name of the owner of each lot, if known, and if unknown, the word "unknown" shall be written opposite the number of the assessment, together with the amount assessed on the lot. The superintendent of streets shall list the names of owners as shown on the most recently certified property tax assessment roll and any other person of whom the superintendent has personal knowledge that such other person may be the owner of the respective lot. The assessments upon the lots assessed shall be consecutively numbered, and the diagram shall be numbered to correspond with the numbers of the assessments.

G. If the contractor is charged with collecting the assessment, a warrant, signed by the superintendent and countersigned by the chairman of the board of directors, shall be attached to the assessment, and shall be substantially in the following form: "By virtue hereof, I (name of superintendent of streets), of the (name of district), by virtue of the authority vested in me as said superintendent of streets, do authorize and empower (name of contractor), the contractor's agents or assigns, to demand and receive the several assessments upon the assessment hereto attached, and this shall be the warrant for the same." If the district charges itself with collection of the assessment and the making of cash demands on the owners of the property assessed, no warrant need be issued, and in this article, the terms "assessment and warrant" or "warrant and assessment" refer only to the assessment.

H. The assessment and warrant, if applicable, shall be recorded in the office of the superintendent not earlier than the date of the award of the construction contract, and one diagram shall be filed in that office. When so recorded the several amounts assessed shall be a lien upon the lots assessed for a period terminating on the date the assessment against the respective lot is paid in full, and such recording shall be notice to all persons interested of the contents of the record.

I. The lien of the assessment is a first lien on the property assessed, subject only to the lien for general taxes and prior special assessments.

#### Section 48-928. Delivery of warrant and assessment to contractor or treasurer; demand for payment; release of assessments; review of assessment; hearing

A. After the assessment and warrant, if applicable, are recorded, they shall be delivered to the contractor or to the treasurer of the district if the district charges itself with the duty of making demands for the payment of the several assessments, together with one of the diagrams, and by virtue of the warrant, the contractor or treasurer is authorized to demand and receive the amount of the several assessments.

B. The contractor or district shall call upon the owner of the lot assessed either in person or by mail, if the owner can conveniently be found, and demand payment, and if paid shall give a receipt therefor. The receipt, when presented to the superintendent, shall authorize or be an order to the superintendent to release the assessment.

C. The contractor or the responsible person acting for the district shall promptly notify the superintendent of all payments made to him, whereupon the superintendent shall release assessments which have been fully paid. When the name of the owner of the lot is stated as "unknown" on the assessment, the contractor or treasurer shall demand payment of a person in possession. If a person is in possession, such demand may be made either by mail if a mailing address for the person in possession can be determined or in person. If the premises are unoccupied or the person in possession cannot be found, such demand is unnecessary. The district may appoint a bank, savings and loan association or trust company as its depository for collection of the cash demands. Fees and expenses for such services may be included in the incidental expenses.

D. The warrant shall be returned to the superintendent within forty days after its date with a "return" endorsed on the warrant, signed by the contractor or treasurer, verified upon oath stating the nature and character of the demand, and whether any assessments remain unpaid in whole or in part, and the amount thereof. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, the verified statement of the person making the return is conclusive proof that the demand for payment was made upon each owner, person in possession or each parcel of property as required by this section. The superintendent shall record the return so made in the margin of the record of the warrant and assessment. After return of the assessment and warrant all amounts remaining due shall draw interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum until paid or, on the issuance of bonds, at the rate specified in the bonds, payable for the semiannual period specified in the bonds notwithstanding the fact that the installments of assessments may be due at dates earlier than installments of interest are payable on the bonds.

E. Upon recording the assessment and warrant, the superintendent shall notify the board of directors of the recording, and the board shall fix a time when it will hear and pass upon the assessment and the proceedings theretofore had and taken, which shall not be less than twenty days from the date of the recording. The board shall cause notice of the hearing to be given by publication for five days in a daily newspaper or two times in a semiweekly or weekly newspaper published and of general circulation in the county within which the district is located, the first publication of which shall be at least ten days prior to the hearing, and by mailing a copy of the notice showing the amount of proposed assessment by first class mail, at least twenty days before the hearing date, to all persons owning real property affected by the assessments as the names and addresses appear on the last equalized certified property tax roll. If no address appears for any person on the last equalized certified tax roll, then no notice need be mailed to such person. The street superintendent shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall recite in the affidavit that the persons to whom notices were mailed constitute all persons whose names and addresses appear on the tax roll as owning property within the area to be assessed. The affidavit is conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed. Failure to receive notice does not constitute any jurisdictional defect invalidating an improvement district, any proceeding or assessment if notice has been sent pursuant to this section.

F. The owners and all other persons directly interested in the work or in the assessment who have any objection to the legality of the assessment or to any of the previous proceedings connected therewith may, prior to the time fixed for the hearing, file a written notice briefly specifying the grounds of their objections. At the time fixed for the hearing or at any time not later than ten days thereafter to which the hearing may be postponed, the board of directors shall hear and pass upon the objections. The decision of the board of directors shall be final and conclusive upon all persons entitled to object as to all errors, informalities and irregularities which the board of directors might have remedied or avoided at any time during the progress of the proceedings.

G. After the hearing, if the board of directors finds that the assessment has not been fairly apportioned, it shall modify the amounts of the several assessments and may order that the assessment be recomputed if it finds that the benefits to any lots do not equal the amount of such lots' assessment. When recomputing the assessment, the superintendent of streets shall levy the reassessments according to the benefits derived, as instructed by the board of directors, notwithstanding the fact that the reduction of any assessment may cause a corresponding increase in other assessments; except that without the written consent of the owner of land to be assessed, no assessment or assessments may be increased in such a manner which causes the total assessment for all work and expenses to exceed the stated total amount set forth on the engineer's official estimate.

H. At any time within one year from the date the superintendent of streets files the certificate of completion as provided in section 48-935, subsection G, the superintendent of streets, any member of the board of directors, any owner or any person claiming an interest in any lot which received an assessment may file a written notice with the clerk stating that the work has not been performed substantially in accordance with the resolution of intention, the plans, specifications and estimate. The notice shall state in particular the contractor's failure to perform and may also state, if applicable, any requested reduction in the assessment of any one or more parcels due solely to the failure of such performance. The notice shall state the name and address of the person filing the notice and shall describe such person's interest in land subject to assessment, if applicable.

I. On receipt of such a notice, the board of directors shall set a date for a hearing on the notice. The board of directors shall give notice of the hearing to the contractor and the contractor's surety, the superintendent of streets, the person appointed to take charge of and superintend the work and all persons whose names and addresses appear in the notice. In addition, the clerk shall cause a notice of the hearing to be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.

J. At the hearing, the board shall determine whether the work was completed in accordance with the resolution of intention, the plans and specifications and any corrections or alterations of such plans deemed necessary by the superintendent. If the board of directors determines that the work has not been so completed, it shall order the contractor to complete the work and shall set a reasonable time for such completion and shall recess the hearing until the date set for completion. If at the date set to reconvene the hearing, the evidence shows that the work is then completed, the board of directors shall enter such findings on its minutes. If the board determines that the contractor is making a good faith attempt to complete the work, it may continue the completion date and recess the hearing to a later date. If, at the hearing or at any recessed hearing, the board of directors finds that the contractor refuses to complete or is incapable of completing the work, it shall order and the county attorney shall bring an action against the contractor and its surety to collect such amounts or cause such performance as is necessary to complete the work.

K. If the board determines that for any reason the work cannot be completed and no recovery can be made against the contractor or the contractor's surety, the board may then order the superintendent of streets to recalculate the assessment, taking into consideration the effect the contractor's failure to perform may have had on the actual benefits derived from the improvement and to reduce some or all assessments to reflect the reduced benefits. If the assessments are reduced, the district shall assume as a contingent liability any difference between the amounts thereafter received on the semiannual assessment payments and the amounts of principal and interest thereafter due on the bonds. The assumption of such amount becomes a general obligation of the district.

L. All decisions made concerning any notice filed under authority of this section are final and conclusive as to the persons filing the notice, the contractor and the contractor's surety and as to the alleged defect in the work. After a ruling on any alleged defect in the work, the board shall not entertain or hear a later notice concerning the same defect, whether or not filed by a person other than the person filing the original notice.

M. After the work is completed, the superintendent shall file with the clerk a recalculated assessment based on the actual quantities determined by the engineer to have been constructed or installed, or the actual cost of the acquisition, as the case may be, together with the known incidental expenses expended to that date and the itemized estimated incidental expenses remaining to be expended. The engineer need not recompute each individual assessment but shall determine the amount of the increase or decrease to be assessed and shall file a supplemental statement with the clerk setting forth the ratio of the difference between the contractor's bid and the recapitulated amount and ordering that each assessment be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by such ratio. If the total assessment is decreased, the treasurer shall return to the owner, if the owner can be located, that portion of each assessment previously paid in cash which represents an excess payment.

#### Section 48-929. Action against property owner to collect assessment

A. At any time after thirty-five days from the date of the warrant, or, if any objection filed with the board of directors as provided in section 48-928 is denied, at any time after five days from its decision, the contractor may sue the owner of the lot assessed and recover the amount of any assessment remaining unpaid with interest thereon at the rate of eight per cent per annum until paid, and to foreclose the lien of the assessment.

B. Where personal demand has been made, and the owner has refused to pay the assessment so demanded, the plaintiff may recover a reasonable attorney's fee.

C. Only one action shall be commenced for the foreclosure of liens arising under a single proceeding against the same defendant.

D. The warrant, assessment and diagram, with the affidavit of demand and nonpayment, shall be prima facie evidence of the regularity and correctness of the assessment and of the prior proceedings and acts of the superintendent and board of directors, upon which the warrant, assessment and diagram are based, and like evidence of the right of the plaintiff to recover.

#### Section 48-930. Invalidity of liens and bonds; extent of validity; means to secure interest of persons damaged

A. If the lien of an assessment or reassessment, or of a bond issued to represent the amount assessed on any lot is held invalid by a court because a portion of the improvement ordered was without the power of the board of directors to order, or was not properly embraced within the contract for the work, or in the assessment made to cover the expenses, the owner of the warrant or the holder of the bond is entitled to a judgment determining what portion of the assessment was legal. There shall thereafter be issued to him by the superintendent within sixty days, and in accordance with the directions of the judgment, a new assessment for an amount which the court finds was the reasonable value of the portion of the improvement legally authorized by the proceedings, which amount shall be reassessed upon the property in the same manner and with like effect as provided for issuing the original assessment, and may be enforced as an original assessment. The holder of bonds representing the original assessment shall be entitled to new bonds on each lot representing the amount of the reassessment.

B. If the lien of an assessment, or of a bond issued therefor, is held invalid by a court for any cause arising subsequent to the time the authority of the board of directors attaches to order the work, or if such lien is defeated or held invalid for any cause, and it also appears that the owner of the property holding it at the time the notice of the award of contract was published had personal knowledge of the intention to order the award of the contract, and did not file a protest against the improvement or a notice of his objection to the award of contract, the owner of the assessment or bond may recover from the owner of the lot covered by the assessment, such sum as the court shall find the lot to have been actually benefited by the improvement, not exceeding the amount which would have been properly assessable against the lot.

#### Section 48-931. Proportionate assessment; collection or issuance of bonds

The board of directors may, upon completion of any portion of the improvement for which the contract price equals twenty thousand dollars or more, order the superintendent to make an assessment for the proportionate part of the contract completed, and thereon proceedings and rights of collection of such proportionate amount shall be had as provided by this article. If the resolution of intention for the improvement provides for the issuance of improvement bonds, they shall be issued and delivered to the contractor for the proportionate amount of the contract price so assessed.

#### Section 48-932. Correction of assessment; reallocation of assessment

A. After an assessment has been approved by the board of directors, the contractor and all persons having an interest in any lot assessed may request the board of directors, by a duly acknowledged written instrument, to modify or correct an assessment. The board may order such modification or correction to be made, and direct the superintendent to note the modification or correction on his record of the assessment, together with the date it is made. The modification or corrections under this subsection shall not affect the rights of persons under the assessment who have not joined in the request.

B. The board may reallocate all or part of an assessment as follows:

1. The superintendent shall prepare a list of all assessments to be reallocated, including:

(a) The assessment number, legal description and amount assessed on each affected parcel before the reallocation.

(b) The assessment number, legal description and name and address of the owner as shown on the most recent tax roll.

(c) The amount to be assessed on each parcel after reallocation.

2. The superintendent shall prepare an amendment to the assessment diagram reflecting the new assessment numbers and parcel boundaries.

3. The superintendent shall cause a notice to be mailed to each owner of an affected parcel showing the proposed reallocation and stating that the owner may file a written objection to the reallocation within twenty days after the notice was mailed.

4. If no objections are received within twenty days after the notice is mailed, the board may approve the proposed reallocation.  If timely objections are received, the board shall hold a hearing on the objections.  The board shall mail notice of the hearing to all affected owners at least ten days before the hearing.  At the hearing the objecting parties shall present evidence supporting their objections.  After the hearing the board shall rule on all objections received and may approve the proposed reallocation or may make changes as the board considers necessary and approve the reallocation as changed.  The board shall also approve the amendment to the assessment diagram as submitted or with changes the board considers to be necessary.

5. After the board’s decision, the superintendent shall record the reallocated assessment and amended assessment diagram in the superintendent’s office.

6. The amount assessed immediately after the reallocation shall be equal to the amount assessed immediately before the reallocation.

7. As a condition to reallocation, the board may require the affected property owners to pay the costs of reallocation, including engineering and legal costs, or may include the costs in the amount assessed against the affected parcels.  The costs are due and payable as part of the next installment of the assessment.

 

#### Section 48-933. Issuance of improvement bonds; fund for payment of bonds

A. The board of directors may determine that improvement bonds be issued to represent the cost and expense of the work or improvement constructed. The bonds shall be issued in the name of the district but shall be made payable only from the special fund collected by the district from special assessments levied and assessed upon the lots fronting upon the street improved and those situated in the quarter block and irregular blocks adjoining and cornering upon the crossings, or where there is a termination in the two quarter blocks adjoining and cornering upon them halfway to the next main street crossing, and all the way to a boundary line of the district when no cross street intervenes, or, if an assessment district has been created by the resolution of intention for the work, upon the lots included within the limits of the assessment district.

B. All sums collected from the special assessments shall be placed in the special fund and shall be used for no other purpose than payment of the principal and interest of the bonds.

#### Section 48-934. Description of improvement bonds in resolution and notices

A. When the board of directors determines that improvement bonds shall be issued, it shall so declare in the resolution of intention for the work and shall specify the maximum rate of interest which they may bear.

B. A notice that the bonds will be paid from a special fund collected in not to exceed twenty-five annual installments, or not to exceed forty annual installments in the case of domestic water improvement districts and domestic wastewater improvement districts as defined by section 48-1011, from the assessments of twenty-five dollars or over remaining unpaid thirty days after the date of the warrant, or after the date of assessment if no warrant is issued, or five days after the decision of the board upon an objection shall be included in the warrant.

C. All other proceedings for the work up to and including the approval of the assessment by the board, and including delivery of the assessment to the contractor or treasurer, demand of payment of the several assessments and the return and record thereof, shall be in all respects as provided in this article.

#### Section 48-935. List of unpaid assessments; issuance of bonds; denominations; coupons; due date; funds

A. After the return of the assessment and warrant, if applicable, and after the superintendent has recorded the return, the superintendent shall make and certify to the clerk a complete list of all unpaid assessments that amount to twenty-five dollars or over upon any assessment.

B. If any person before certification of the list to the clerk presents to the superintendent an affidavit that the person is the owner of a lot in the list, accompanied by the certificate of a searcher of records that the person is the owner of record, and notifies the superintendent in writing that the person desires no bond to be issued for the assessment upon the lot, then the assessment shall not be included in the list, and shall remain collectable as provided by this article. Omission to file notice shall bar any defense against the bonds except the defense that the board of directors did not have authority to issue the bonds.

C. The clerk shall present the list to the board of directors at its next meeting after the return has been recorded. At any time after the recording of the return, the board of directors may by resolution direct improvement bonds to be issued in the amount of the assessments remaining unpaid, prescribing the number and denomination of the bonds, and the times when payable, which shall be so fixed, not exceeding twenty-five years and three months from the date of the bonds or not to exceed forty annual installments in the case of domestic water improvement districts and domestic wastewater improvement districts as defined by section 48-1011. As far as practicable, the denominations of the bonds shall be fixed by the board of directors at one hundred dollars or some multiple thereof. The board of directors may provide in the form of bond for redemption prior to maturity upon giving notice the board of directors determines to be reasonable and for the payment of a premium at redemption if the board of directors determines the premium to be reasonable or advisable.

D. The bonds shall be issued as of the date set by the board of directors and shall bear interest from that date at a rate that shall not exceed the rate specified in the resolution of intention. The bonds may be registered as to both principal and interest, or they may have semiannual interest coupons attached. The first interest payment date shall be on either January 1 or July 1, as the case may be.

E. The due date of all bonds shall be January 1 or July 1 in the years in which they respectively become due.

F. The district may sell the bonds at public or private sale at the best price obtainable, which may be above, at or below par, and shall require the purchaser also to pay accrued interest to the date of payment. The bonds may bear interest at any interest rate not in excess of the maximum rate set in the resolution of intention. If the bonds are not sold by the district, they shall be delivered to the contractor for the amount of the assessments remaining unpaid, and the bonds shall bear interest at the maximum interest rate set forth in the resolution of intention.

G. If the bonds are sold before the work or acquisition is completed, the proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the treasurer to be used for payment of incidental expenses and payments for construction or acquisition. Proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be used for the acquisition mentioned in the resolution of intention or to make semimonthly or monthly payments to the contractor upon a basis of ninety per cent of the value of the work actually performed as estimated by the superintendent or engineer employed for those purposes to and including the fifteenth or last day of each calendar month. The balance shall be paid after the superintendent of streets has recorded in the superintendent's office a certificate of substantial completion of the work described in the resolution of intention, in the same manner as the recording of the assessment. The superintendent shall record the certificate after the work has been completed to the superintendent's satisfaction. The superintendent of streets shall also cause a copy of the notice of completion to be mailed to each property owner in the same manner as the notice of hearing on the assessment. Pending use of the bond proceeds, the treasurer may invest the proceeds solely for the benefit of the district in any investments for which sinking funds of this state may be invested. If bond anticipation notes have been issued, the bond proceeds, or so much as is necessary, shall be used to redeem such notes.

H. If deemed necessary by the board of directors, a reserve fund may be established either with proceeds from the sale of the bonds or by increasing the collections of the annual installments of principal up to the first ten years the bonds are outstanding, over and above the amounts required to pay maturing principal on the bonds. The monies in the reserve fund may be used only to cure deficits in the principal and interest funds or to pay interest and principal upon the final maturity or maturities of the bonds.

#### Section 48-936. Form of bonds

A. The bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the board of directors, attested by the clerk and sealed with the corporate seal of the district, and the interest coupons shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman and clerk.

B. The bonds shall be substantially in the following form: "State of Arizona. County of ________________ improvement district bond.  Know all men by these presents: That the ___________ improvement district of ________________ county, Arizona, a duly organized improvement district, promises to pay as hereinafter stated to the bearer hereof, on the _____ day of _______________, the sum of ______________ dollars, together with interest on said sum, at the rate of _________ per cent per annum, payable semiannually on the first days of January and July of each year, as evidenced by and upon the presentation and surrender of the interest coupons hereto attached as they severally become due. (Here insert prior redemption feature, if applicable.) Both principal and interest are payable at the office of the county treasurer of ______________ county, Arizona or at _______________ (as applicable). This bond is issued in pursuance of law, and is one of a series of _____________ bonds of like tenor and date for the total sum of ____________________ dollars issued for that certain improvement in said district consisting of (briefly describing improvement), initiated by resolution no. ______________ of (name of district), and is payable only out of the special fund to be collected from special assessments imposed on the lots, or parcels of land fronting on or benefited by said improvement. Said special fund is set apart by law for the payment of said bonds, and can be used for no other purpose. It is hereby certified and declared that the improvement for which this series of bonds is issued is authorized by law, that all the acts, conditions and things required to be done, precedent to and in the issuing of this series of bonds, have been done and performed in regular and due form as required by the laws of the state of Arizona, and all ordinances and resolutions of said district, that the special assessments out of which said bonds are to be paid are first liens on the property assessed, subject only to the lien for general taxes and prior special assessments, and any bona fide purchaser for value of this bond has the right to rely on the recitals herein contained. For the assessment or reassessment, collection and payment of said special assessments, the full faith and diligence of said district are hereby irrevocably pledged."

#### Section 48-937. Certification of unpaid assessments; payments by installment; interest; payments in advance

A. The superintendent, when certifying the list of assessments unpaid to the clerk, shall write the word "certified" on the record of the assessment opposite each assessment included in the list and all assessments of twenty-five dollars or over shall cease to be payable in cash and shall be payable only in annual installments that correspond to the maturity dates that are set forth on the bonds. These installments shall be due on December 1 or June 1 in each year preceding January 1 or July 1 on which the bonds become due. The lien of each assessment on the property assessed shall continue and remain in full force and effect until the assessment is fully paid.

B. An uncollected installment shall be added to the succeeding installment and, together with interest and penalties, shall be payable.

C. The number of installments in which the assessment is payable shall correspond to the number of years in which there are bonds to be paid, but the total number of installments shall not exceed twenty or not to exceed forty in the case of domestic water improvement districts and domestic wastewater improvement districts as defined by section 48-1011.

D. All assessments of twenty-five dollars or more not paid before the certification of assessments unpaid to the clerk shall bear interest from the date of the warrant at the same rate as that specified for the bonds in the resolution of intention. The interest shall be payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, immediately before the interest becomes due on the bonds.

E. The board of directors may provide for receiving payment of the installments of the assessment before they become due, and using the proceeds in redeeming bonds presented for redemption by the owners thereof, or for investing the proceeds in improvement bonds for other work or other satisfactory investment, but no investment of the funds shall be made to prejudice the prompt payment of the bonds on the date they become due.

#### Section 48-938. Collection of assessment installments; notice; delinquent installments

A. All assessments not certified to the clerk shall remain collectible by the contractor or the district as provided by this article, but the superintendent shall promptly collect all installments of principal and interest on the assessments so certified to the clerk. At least thirty days before any installment of principal or interest becomes due, the superintendent shall give notice by mail to the owner of each parcel on which an installment is due at the address shown on the most recent property tax roll. The mailing shall be completed at least ten days before the date the installment is due. In addition to the requirements of subsection B of this section, the notice shall include the improvement district's name, the amount of the installment on the parcel then due and the date that the property will be put up for sale if the installment is not paid when due.

B. The notice shall serve for all assessments in the district becoming due on the date specified therein, and shall be substantially in the following form:

____________ improvement district.

Notice of special assessments due on improvements.

All persons owning property heretofore assessed for improvements will take notice that an installment of ____________ becomes due and payable on or before (date) and if not so paid on or before said date the same will become delinquent and five per cent penalty will be added to the amount thereof. Failure to pay thereafter will result in the whole amount of the assessment coming due and the sale of the property assessed, in accordance with the provisions of section 48-939, Arizona Revised Statutes.

C. The board of directors may provide a more detailed notice. The mailing of notice provided for in this section shall apply to and govern all bonds and assessments issued and levied, and all notices of special assessments due on improvements shall be mailed as prescribed by this section.

D. When an installment is paid, the superintendent shall note in the record the date of the payment and the name of the person by or for whom it is paid and shall, if requested, give a receipt therefor.

E. On the day succeeding the date on which an installment becomes due all installments unpaid shall become delinquent, and the superintendent shall certify such fact on the records and mark each delinquent installment as delinquent and add five per cent to the amount of each delinquent installment.

#### Section 48-939. List of delinquent installments; publication of notice; sale of delinquent property

A. The superintendent shall, within twenty days from the date of delinquency, prepare a list of the assessments on which any installment is delinquent. The list shall contain a description of each parcel of property, and opposite each description the name of the owner as stated in the assessment, or, if no name is stated in the assessment, the word "unknown", and the amount of the installment delinquent, together with the penalty and costs due, including the cost of advertising.

B. The superintendent shall give a notice that unless each delinquent installment, together with the penalty and costs thereon, is paid, the whole amount of the assessment will be declared due, and the property upon which the assessment is a lien will be sold at public auction at a time and place to be specified in the notice. At least ten days before the date set for the sale the notice shall be mailed to the owner of the lot or parcel on which an installment is delinquent at the address shown on the most recent property tax roll.

C. The time of the sale shall not be less than ten days after the completion of the mailing of the notices, and the place of sale shall be in or in front of the office of the superintendent, in or in front of the usual place of meeting of the board of directors of the district or at the place otherwise designated in the notice.

#### Section 48-940. Payment after delinquency and before sale

At any time prior to the sale of any lot assessed, any person may pay the delinquent installment on the lot together with the penalty and costs then due, including the cost of advertising, whereupon the superintendent shall note on his records the date of payment, the name of the person by or for whom the payment is paid, and the amount paid.

#### Section 48-940.01. Notice to lien claimants; loans

A. Before the date fixed for the sale or before the date to which the sale has been postponed, the superintendent shall obtain a record search that shows the names and addresses of record of all lien claimants on, and other persons with an interest in, all lots or parcels on which an installment of the assessment is delinquent. The cost of a record search may be added to the assessment and is deemed to be a portion of the delinquent installment.

B. At least ten days before the sale date or the date to which the sale has been postponed, the superintendent shall mail a notice of the date and place of the sale or postponed sale to the owner and to each of the lien claimants and other persons with an interest as shown by the search of records. The notice shall state the date of the sale, the amount of the delinquent installments including penalties, costs of advertisement and costs of the record search, shall state that the whole amount of the assessment and costs and penalties are due at the time of the sale and shall state that, unless redeemed within the time allowed by law, a superintendent's deed will be delivered to the purchaser and the superintendent's deed shall convey title to the lands described therein free and clear of all interests and liens, except for the lien for general property taxes and prior special assessments.

C. A final sale may not be held unless the superintendent has provided notice by mail as prescribed by this section to all lien claimants and other persons with an interest discovered in the search of records. The mailing may occur either before the date originally set for the sale or before the date of any postponed sale, and only one mailing and one record search are required.

D. The county may loan to the district and the district may borrow from the county any monies necessary to pay current bond interest or principal that would be unpaid as a result of a postponed sale. The district shall repay the loan to the county when the delinquent installments are paid or when the lots on which the assessments are delinquent are sold.

#### Section 48-941. Sale procedure; district as purchaser

A. On the day fixed for the sale, the superintendent shall at ten o'clock a.m., or any time thereafter to which the sale may be adjourned, begin the sale of the property advertised, commencing at the head of the list and continuing in the numerical order of lots, until all are sold. He may postpone or continue the sale from day to day until all the property is sold. Each lot separately assessed shall be offered for sale separately. The sale shall be for the entire assessment including the delinquent installment, and the person who will take the least quantity of land and then and there pay the amount of the assessment, penalty and costs due, including fifty cents to the superintendent for a certificate of sale, shall become the purchaser.

B. If there is no purchaser for any lot offered for sale, the lot shall be struck off to the district as the purchaser for the amount of the entire assessment and the district shall thereupon assume as a general obligation the amount of the assessment and interest accruing thereon, subject to the limitation provided in section 48-952. The district may sell any lot, so purchased after the expiration of the time for redemption, at public or private sale. All sums received by the district from redemption of property purchased by it and from sale by it of property so purchased shall be paid into the special fund for the payment of the bonds until the special fund is made sufficient to pay all outstanding bonds.

#### Section 48-942. Certificate of sale; lien

A. After making the sale, the superintendent shall execute, in duplicate, a certificate of sale stating the description of the property sold, the name and address of the owner and all lien claimants as given by the record search prescribed by section 48-940.01, that the property was sold for a delinquent assessment, specifying the improvement for which the assessment was made, the amount for which the property was sold, the date of the sale, the name of the purchaser and the first date on which the purchaser may apply for a deed. The superintendent shall file one copy of the certificate in his office and deliver the other to the purchaser, or if the district is the purchaser, to the clerk, who shall file the certificate in the clerk's office.

B. On filing the copy of the certificate in the office of the superintendent, the lien of the assessment shall vest in the purchaser, and is only divested by a redemption of the property, as provided by this article.

C. The superintendent shall also enter on the record of the assessment, opposite the description of each lot offered for sale, a description of the part thereof sold, the amount for which the lot was sold, the date of the sale and the name of the purchaser.

#### Section 48-943. Redemption

A. Redemption may be made by any party having an interest in the lot at any time before the execution and delivery of a deed therefor by paying to the superintendent the amount for which the property was sold and five per cent thereon if paid within three months from the date of sale, ten per cent if paid within six months, twelve per cent if paid within nine months, fifteen per cent if paid within twelve months, or twenty per cent if paid at any time after twelve months.

B. When redemption is made, the superintendent shall note that fact on the duplicate certificate of sale in his office and deposit the amount paid with the treasurer, who shall credit the purchaser named in the certificate of sale with such amount, and pay such sum to the purchaser or his assignee, upon the surrender of the certificate of sale.

C. When the district is the purchaser, the treasurer shall notify the clerk of the redemption, and the clerk shall thereupon cancel the certificate of sale in his office.

#### Section 48-944. Deed to purchaser; notice to owner; redemption after notice; effect of deed

A. After the expiration of thirteen months from the date of sale, the superintendent shall execute to the purchaser, or his assignee, on his application, if he has fully complied with the provisions of this section, a deed to the property sold in which shall be recited substantially the matters contained in the certificate, any assignment thereof, and that no person has redeemed the property.

The balance shall be paid to the contractor after the sale of the bonds solely from the proceeds. If bonds equal to the balance remaining cannot be sold then the balance shall be paid by delivery of a like principal amount of bonds to the contractor.

G. The issuance of bond anticipation notes shall constitute an assignment to the district of the monies due the contractor under the construction contract.

#### Section 48-1001. Fund transfers; successive levies excused

A. If the annual installments of special assessments of any county improvement district do not provide funds sufficient for the payment of the bonds and the interest thereon as they shall accrue, the board of supervisors may, after a public hearing and upon such notice as the board of supervisors deems necessary, exercise the option to transfer from the contingency portion of the county general fund to the district an amount sufficient to remove any deficiency. The board of directors of the district shall then immediately initiate collection of such deficiency by proceeding against the property delinquent in payment of special assessments.

B. From the amount thereafter recovered from such delinquent property proceeded against pursuant to either section 48-946 or title 35, chapter 3, article 4.1 or this article or through the later collection of the delinquent assessments, the district shall transfer to the county general fund all such amounts recovered from the proceedings up to an amount equal to the amount previously transferred to the district.

#### Section 48-1002. Complete procedure

Section 48-1003 provides a complete procedure for court proceedings, sale, purchase by the public entity, payment of the purchase price and other amounts, redemption, resale, and disposition of the proceeds of redemption or sale, of delinquent properties, when installments of principal and interest are collectible pursuant to section 48-984, and the performance of the obligations imposed and of the other matters authorized shall not be deemed to be limited by any other law.

#### Section 48-1003. Court proceedings and sale of delinquent property

A. The board of directors of any improvement district may, as a cumulative remedy, order that an action in a court of competent jurisdiction be brought pursuant to this article for judicial sale of delinquent property.

B. Any number of properties subject to the same assessment for improvements may be included in one action and the equity of redemption under any lien except general property tax liens may be determined in the action.

C. The action shall be brought in the name of the district as plaintiff. The complaint shall allege the passage of the resolution of intention, confirmation and levy of assessment, that bonds were issued upon the security of such assessment, giving the date of the last maturity, the amounts delinquent against the properties proceeded against and that the board of directors has ordered the action. The names of the defendants shall be considered as parties defendant only as to the property so designated.

D. The court may enter separate judgments as to any property and the action shall continue as to the remaining properties. Each judgment shall separately state as to each property:

1. A description of the property.

2. The names of the defendants designated as having ownership or other interests whose rights have been determined by the judgment.

3. The amounts of the delinquent installments and interest and penalties, a proportionate part of the costs of the proceeding, including a reasonable attorney's fee to be fixed by the court and the amount for which the property is to be sold. Actions filed pursuant to this article shall be set for trial at the earliest possible date and shall take precedence over all other civil actions except older matters of the same character and matters entitled to special precedence. An appeal may be taken as to any separate property included in a judgment, but such appeal shall not delay execution upon or further proceedings concerning other properties not involved in the appeal.

E. Upon execution on a judgment each property shall be offered for sale separately and shall be sold to the bidder who offers to pay the whole amount of the judgment against the property. If two or more bidders offer to purchase the same property it shall be sold to the bidder who offers to accept the lowest rate of penalty in event the property is redeemed from the sale. The purchaser shall take the property subject to all unpaid general property taxes and all unpaid installments of principal, interest and penalties to all public improvement assessments.

F. If there is no offer to purchase the property for an amount not less than the judgment against it, the property shall be sold to the district for the amount of the judgment at the maximum rate of penalty. The district may sell property purchased pursuant to this subsection at public or private sale and upon such terms as the board of directors deems appropriate but in no event shall annual installments be less than the obligations of such property in regard to bond principal and interest payments nor shall payments be deferred for a term longer than the final maturity of the bonds issued against the assessment.

G. From the amounts received from the redemption of property purchased by the district, or from the proceeds of sales of property by the district, there shall be returned to the general fund any amounts that were advanced in connection with such property pursuant to section 48-1001. The balance shall be paid into the special fund for payment of bond principal and interest of the bonds issued in the proceedings of the district, thereafter to be disposed of pursuant to section 48-958. The purchaser of property from the district shall take the property subject to all unpaid general property taxes and all unpaid installments of principal, interest and penalties to all public improvement assessments.

H. Except as otherwise provided in this section, all actions shall be conducted pursuant to title 33, chapter 6, article 2 and all proceedings supplemental to judgment, including appeal, execution and sale, redemption and the issuance of a deed shall be conducted pursuant to such article, except that redemption may be had at any time within one year after the date of judicial sale, and the judgment lien shall not extend to, nor may the judgment be satisfied out of, any other property, nor may general execution be issued.

#### Section 48-1004. Limitation

The remedies provided by this article may be exercised by order made at any time prior to the expiration of four years subsequent to the date of delinquency of the last installment due or to become due upon the assessment, including modified, proportionate, supplemental or reassessment, in default.

The domestic water improvement district or domestic wastewater improvement district is the successor in interest of the former county improvement district and succeeds to all rights, privileges and powers of the former county improvement district with full rights to collect any debt, liability, obligation or assessment owed to the former county improvement district and to levy assessments, issue bonds and levy and collect taxes for the payment of the general obligations of the district. A person shall not be relieved of any debt, liability, obligation or assessment to a county improvement district by reason of its conversion pursuant to this section.

E. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of a board of supervisors pursuant to section 48-1016.

A. Notwithstanding any other law, a domestic water or wastewater improvement district may construct, acquire, or improve a drinking water, wastewater or water reclamation facility with monies borrowed from or financial assistance, including forgivable principal, provided by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona pursuant to title 49, chapter 8.

B. To repay financial assistance from the authority a district may enter into a financial assistance loan repayment agreement with the authority.  A financial assistance loan repayment agreement is payable from any revenues otherwise authorized by law to be used to pay long-term obligations.

C. For a district with a population of more than fifty thousand persons, the board of directors of the district shall submit the question of entering and performing a financial assistance loan repayment agreement to the qualified electors voting at a regular or special election in the district.  An election is not required if voter approval has previously been obtained for substantially the same project with another funding source. For a district with a population of fifty thousand persons or less, the board may enter into the financial assistance loan repayment agreement on the approval of the board and an election is not required.

D. A financial assistance loan repayment agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall contain the covenants and conditions pertaining to the construction, acquisition or improvement of a drinking water, wastewater or water reclamation facility and repayment of the loan as the authority deems proper. Financial assistance loan repayment agreements may provide for the payment of interest on the unpaid principal balance of the agreement at the rates established in the agreement. The agreement may also provide for payment of the domestic water or wastewater improvement district's proportionate share of the expenses of administering the drinking water revolving fund established by sections 49-1221 and 49-1241 and may provide that the domestic water or wastewater improvement district pay financing and loan administration fees approved by the authority. These costs may be included in the assessment or revenue amounts pledged to repay the loan. Districts are bound by and shall fully perform the loan repayment agreements, and the agreements are incontestable after the loan is funded by the authority. The domestic water improvement district shall also agree to pay the authority's costs in issuing bonds or otherwise borrowing to fund a loan.

E. A financial assistance loan repayment agreement under this section does not create a debt of the domestic water or wastewater improvement district, and the authority shall not require that payment of a loan agreement be made from other than those sources permitted in subsection B of this section.

F. A domestic water or wastewater improvement district may employ or contract for the services of attorneys, accountants, financial consultants and other experts in their field as deemed necessary to perform services with respect to the financial assistance loan repayment agreement.

G. This section is supplemental and alternative to any other law under which a district may borrow money or issue bonds. This section shall be construed as the exclusive authorization to enter into loan agreements with the authority.

H. A district may borrow additional monies or enter into additional financial assistance loan repayment agreements with the water infrastructure finance authority in an amount up to the amount approved pursuant to subsection C of this section less the amount that the district is obligated to repay to the water infrastructure finance authority pursuant to a financial assistance loan repayment agreement.

I. For the purposes of this section "authority" means the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona.

The petition or resolutions shall contain the name and a description of the boundaries of the proposed district and a detailed, accurate map of the area to be included in the district and shall specify that the proposed district will be administered by a district board.  No new territory may be included as a result of the merger, but the merged district may thereafter expand as provided under this chapter.

C. If the county board of supervisors determines after a public hearing that the proposed merger would serve the public convenience, welfare or necessity, the county board of supervisors shall call an election for a vote of the public on the question of the merger of the domestic water improvement districts.  The board of supervisors shall not call an election to merge domestic water improvement districts more frequently than once every two years.  The order shall not be entered until the petitioners or the boards of directors of the domestic water improvement districts have deposited with the board of supervisors sufficient monies, not exceeding one thousand dollars, to defray the expenses of the election.  These monies shall be paid out on the order of the board of supervisors.  If the domestic water improvement districts are merged, the depositors of these monies shall be reimbursed from the merged domestic water improvement district's monies. Whether or not the districts are merged, the domestic water improvement districts shall reimburse the counties for the expenses of the election.

D. If the proposed district is located in more than one county, the petition or resolutions shall be submitted to the board of supervisors of the county in which the majority of the assessed valuation of the proposed merged district is located.  The boards of supervisors of any other counties in which the affected districts are located shall provide information and assistance to the responsible board of supervisors.

E. For any election called pursuant to this section, the words appearing on the ballot shall be "(insert domestic water improvement districts' names) merge as a domestic water improvement district--yes" and "(insert domestic water improvement districts' names) merge as domestic water improvement district--no."

F. Within fourteen days after the election, the board of supervisors shall meet and canvass the returns, and if it is determined that a majority of the votes cast at the election in each of the affected districts is in favor of merging the domestic water improvement districts, the board shall enter that fact on its minutes.

G. If the proposal for merger is approved as provided by subsection F of this section, the governing body of the affected district with the largest population shall call a joint meeting of the governing bodies of the affected districts.  At the joint meeting, a majority of the members of the governing body of each affected district constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business.  The members of the governing bodies of both districts shall convene a joint meeting to appoint a total of at least five persons from all those currently serving on the governing bodies of both of the districts, each of whom shall complete their regular terms of office, except that no more than a simple majority of the persons appointed may serve terms that end in the same year.  No more than a simple majority shall be appointed from the same domestic water improvement district board, and the majority of the merged board shall be filled by board members from the district that has the greater number of customers.  The appointed board shall immediately meet and organize itself and elect from among its members a chairperson.  The appointed board by resolution shall declare the districts merged and each affected district joined.  The resolution and the names of the newly organized board members shall be sent to the county board of supervisors within thirty days after organization and a certified copy of the resolution and the legal description of the merged district shall be recorded in each county in which the district exists.  From the date of the recording of the resolution of merger and legal description of the district by the appointed board, the merger is complete.  The merged district shall assume any debts of each of the affected domestic water improvement districts.

1. Maintain community parks certified for inclusion within the district by the board of directors.

2. Acquire in the name of the district any real or personal property or interest in property by gift, purchase, condemnation or otherwise and own, control, manage or dispose of such property or interest if necessary or convenient for the purpose specified in paragraph 1. Private funds or contributions received by a district for the purpose of defraying expenses of work done under its direction may be expended by the district in compliance with the terms and conditions under which such funds are received, provided the terms and conditions meet the approval of the board and are within the scope of the statutory powers and duties of the district.

3. Join with any other community park maintenance district, municipality or federal or state agency in the maintenance of community parks, located within or without the district, certified for jurisdictional inclusion in the district by the board. No community park may be maintained within an incorporated city or town or within one-half mile of an incorporated city or town without the consent of the governing body of the city or town as evidenced by a formal resolution or ordinance of approval.

4. Sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any property of the district or interest in the property if such property is no longer required for the purposes of the district or if use of it may be permitted without interfering with the use to which it is put by the district.

#### Section 48-1210. Tax levies; delinquency assessment

A. Maintenance and related operating costs incurred by each district shall be paid from revenues derived from an annual tax levy on the real property located within the district. The real property of the district remains liable to taxes for payment of the prorated maintenance costs within the district until paid in full.

B. If the district fails in any fiscal year to collect sufficient revenues through the regular tax levy to pay the required costs of community park maintenance within the district, the difference may be made up by an emergency levy in the current fiscal year under the restrictions of section 48-1211, subsection C, and, if not so made up, shall be included in a required levy the forthcoming fiscal year.

C. On or before July 1 of each year the board of directors shall estimate the amount of money necessary to be raised by taxation to defray maintenance and operation costs, taking into account any deficit or surplus from the preceding year, but not exceeding eighteen per cent of the appraised market value of the community park. The board shall certify the estimate to the county boards of supervisors on or before August 15.

D. The boards of supervisors, at the time of levying general county taxes, shall levy and cause to be collected in the manner prescribed by law for county taxes a tax upon the real property located in the district, based upon the current assessment rolls, sufficient to pay the amount certified by the board of directors. If the board of directors fails to certify to the boards of supervisors the amount necessary, the boards of supervisors shall ascertain the amount which should have been certified and shall levy and cause to be collected a tax sufficient to produce that amount.

E. The tax, when collected, shall be paid into the county treasury of the county in which the major portion of the district is situated to the credit of the maintenance and operating fund of the district. The monies shall be used strictly for the payment of maintenance and related operating costs incurred by the district.

F. The boards of supervisors shall annually establish a time of delinquency for payment of the tax levied pursuant to this section. The failure to pay the regular tax when due subjects the owner of the real property in question to an additional delinquency assessment of fifteen per cent in addition to the amount already owed.

#### Section 48-1211. Fees, rentals and service charges; reserve fund

A. The board of directors may charge and collect fees, rentals and service charges for any service performed or property furnished by the district. Revenue derived from such sources shall be paid into the maintenance and operating fund of the district established pursuant to section 48-1210, subsection E or to the reserve fund established pursuant to subsection B of this section.

B. The proceedings for the collection of a tax levy under section 48-1210 may provide for the establishment of a reserve fund in an amount found by the board of directors to be sufficient to secure payment of all potential maintenance and operating costs if the regular tax levy fails to collect sufficient monies to fund ordinary maintenance and operating costs for the district. The reserve fund may be funded from either excess revenues from the regular tax levy or from fees, rentals and service charges collected pursuant to this section.

C. Whenever the regular tax levy generates revenues insufficient to meet actual maintenance and regulated operating costs for the district in any fiscal year, the reserve fund shall be exhausted before making an emergency assessment levy on the real property located in the district.

#### Section 48-1212. Dissolution of community park maintenance district; disposition of property; tax for outstanding indebtedness

A. A district organized under this article which has no outstanding legal indebtedness may be dissolved on a vote of a majority of the registered voters of the district at a special election called by the board of directors on the question of dissolution. If a majority of the votes cast favors dissolution, the board shall by resolution declare the district dissolved. Within fifteen days after its adoption, a certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the clerk of the boards of supervisors of the counties in which the district was located.

B. Upon dissolution of a district the property of the district which is located in the corporate limits of a city or town vests in that city or town. Other property of the district vests in the county. Any funds of the district at the time of dissolution shall be transferred to the incorporated city or town and to the county in direct proportion to the assessed valuation of taxable real property within the city, town or county, respectively, as it appears on the current assessment rolls.

C. After dissolution of a district, if it appears that there remains unpaid a legal indebtedness, the boards of supervisors of the counties in which the district was located shall levy a tax on the real property within the district, as it existed at the time of dissolution, sufficient to pay the indebtedness and interest on the indebtedness and shall pay the indebtedness and interest from the proceeds of the tax.

#### Section 48-1213. Alternative method of dissolution of community park maintenance district

A. A district organized under this article, the territory of which is wholly included within the corporate limits of a city or town, may be dissolved in the following manner:

1. The board of directors shall approve the transfer of all powers, duties and responsibilities of the board, officers and employees of the district to such city or town, as trustee, and the dissolution of the district by ordinance or resolution.

2. The governing body of the city or town shall approve the acceptance of the trusteeship of the district by ordinance or resolution.

3. Within thirty days after the date of the passage of the latter of the ordinances or resolutions called for in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, the governing body of the city or town shall call a special election of the city or town on the question of whether to accept the trusteeship of the district. The election shall take place on such date as the governing body may designate but not more than sixty days after the ordinance or resolution calling the election is passed, except that no election may be called within twelve months from the date of a previous election called for the same purpose. Only registered voters of the city or town are eligible to vote on the question.

4. When, on the basis of the adoption of the ordinances and resolutions under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, an election is called upon the question of acceptance of the trusteeship under paragraph 3 of this subsection, the board of directors of the district shall also call, at the same time as the election provided for in paragraph 3 of this subsection is called, a separate election among the registered voters of the district on the question of dissolution of the district.

B. If a majority of registered voters of the city or town voting on the question approves it, and a majority of the registered voters of the district voting on the question approves it, the district shall be dissolved as provided in this section. If the registered voters voting in the election conducted pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section fail to accept the trusteeship or if the registered voters voting in the election conducted pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 4 of this section fail to approve dissolution, the district shall not be dissolved and the proceedings shall be terminated.

C. If the district has no legal indebtedness or when all legal indebtedness has been discharged or assumed by the city or town, after otherwise complying with this section, the governing body of the city or town shall as trustees of the district by resolution declare the district dissolved. Within three days after its adoption, a certified copy of the resolution shall be filed with the clerk of the governing body of the city or town in which the district is situated.

D. If the district has legal indebtedness following approval of dissolution as provided in this section, the district shall be administered as provided in this section. Pending dissolution, the administration of district affairs vests in trust in the governing body of the city or town. Members of the governing body of the city or town are trustees of the district for all purposes of the district and as such have the powers and duties prescribed for the board of directors of the district. Such trustees may, except as provided by law, operate the facilities of the district. Indebtedness on behalf of the district does not become indebtedness or obligations of such city or town, except that such city or town is responsible as trustees to insure that all obligations and debts of the district are paid when due from funds available to the trustees from the district. Until dissolution, nothing precludes a district from otherwise continuing to carry on its activities and transacting its business, or from entering into contracts and agreements otherwise authorized or from transferring any property of the district to each city or town.

E. Members of the board of directors, if the terms of such members have not expired, serve as an advisory board to the trustees under subsection D of this section and to the governing body of the city or town following dissolution until expiration of the terms or earlier vacancy, and thereafter the office is abolished.

F. Upon dissolution of a district pursuant to this section, all property of the district vests in the city or town.

G. Notwithstanding section 9-514, the affirmative vote on the dissolution of the district by both the district and the affected city or town under the provisions of this section vests in the city or town authority to construct, purchase, acquire or lease any plant or property for the purpose of community park maintenance and is also authority for the city or town to assume the obligations of a district through the issuance of bonds pursuant to title 9, chapter 5, article 3 and in amounts not exceeding the outstanding value of all obligations of the district.

H. The election held pursuant to this section is deemed to be the election required by section 48-1212.

#### Section 48-1214. Reimbursement for county services

Services provided by a county to a community park maintenance district are subject to reimbursement pursuant to section 11-251.06.

C. In determining the question of the public use in the operations of the proposed district the board shall make its findings by considering all circumstances, facts and reasons bearing upon the question of the public character of the operations of the proposed district.

On approval by a majority of those persons voting on the question, the county board of supervisors shall levy and the department of revenue shall collect a transaction privilege tax pursuant to this section to be used and spent for the purposes described in this chapter.  The initial levy of the tax shall be for a period of up to five years and may be renewed by a subsequent vote of the county's qualified electors for additional periods of five years.  Each month the state treasurer shall remit to the county treasurer the net revenues collected pursuant to this subsection during the second preceding month.  The county treasurer shall remit the monies to the hospital district treasurer who shall deposit the monies in the district's general fund.

D. A hospital district shall not levy a transaction privilege tax at the same time that it is imposing a secondary property tax pursuant to section 48-1907.

#### Section 48-1911. Leases of hospital or urgent care center and equipment; provisions; cancellation for failure to pay rent; re-lease; auction; notice

A. A lease of the hospital or urgent care center and its equipment, as required under section 48-1910 for districts with bonded indebtedness, executed by the board of directors of the district, shall:

1. Contain terms and provisions necessary to assure compliance by the district with the provisions of the federal act and any amendments thereto.

2. Extend for a term to be determined by the board, but not less than five nor more than ten years.

3. Be executed to a corporation not for pecuniary profit, duly organized under the laws of this state for the purpose of conducting a hospital, urgent care center, combined hospital and ambulance service or combined urgent care center and ambulance service.

4. Provide for a rental upon terms and in an amount which will provide a fair return to the district on its investment, be sufficient to meet the payments of principal and interest of bonds issued under this article, and provide amounts necessary to meet the expenses of the district.

B. If a lessee of the hospital or urgent care center and its equipment fails to make the payment of rental required by the lease, the board of directors of the district, at its option, may cancel the lease for such failure. If the lease is cancelled and if the board is then unable to re-lease the hospital or urgent care center and its equipment to a lessee qualified under the provisions of this article at a rental sufficient to meet the payments of principal and interest on any bonds issued by the district and to provide the amounts necessary to meet expenses of the district, the board shall, at public auction, offer to lease the hospital or urgent care center and its equipment to the highest responsible and qualified bidder for such term as the board prescribes, and shall lease the hospital and its equipment to the bidder who bids the highest rental for the prescribed period.

C. Notice of the auction shall be given in a newspaper as provided by section 48-1902 at least once each week for four weeks immediately preceding the auction.

#### Section 48-1912. Bonds

A. Bonds may be issued by the hospital district for the purpose of carrying out any of the provisions of this article. If the board of directors determines that bonds should be issued, application shall be made to the board of supervisors by the board, and the board of supervisors shall submit to a vote of the real property taxpaying electors residing in the district the question in the manner provided by title 35, chapter 3, article 3, and if the majority of the electors voting on the issue approve, the bonds shall be issued as provided by law.  Elections under this subsection must be held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November as prescribed by section 16-204, subsection B, paragraph 1, subdivision (d).

B. Any bonds issued under this article may contain a provision requiring the establishment of a reserve or reserves in an amount equal to the requirements of principal and interest payments for the two years during the life of the bonds requiring the largest amount of principal and interest payments, and the district shall maintain the reserve during the life of the bond issue for the purpose of protecting against any deficiency in rental payments or tax collections. If it becomes necessary to withdraw funds from the reserve to protect against any deficiency, the board of directors of the district shall levy a tax on all the taxable property in the district sufficient to maintain the reserve fund in an amount equal to the original amount thereof. In making the levy for the payment of principal and interest for the last year when the bonds mature, the board of directors shall take into consideration the amount of money then in the reserve fund and shall levy an amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest on the bonds, less the amount then in the reserve fund.

 

#### Section 48-1913. Limit of bonded indebtedness

No hospital district shall incur a bonded indebtedness exceeding ten per cent of the assessed value of all taxable property in the district as shown by the last assessment roll of the county.

The tax shall be computed, entered upon the tax rolls and collected in the same manner as other secondary property taxes in the respective county or counties in which the district or part thereof is located. Monies collected on behalf of the district shall be remitted promptly to and shall be handled by the county treasurer of the organizing county as other special district funds are handled. The district shall be governed by the budget limitation laws of the state.

C. If a district lies in more than one county, the total budget estimate shall be divided by the board of directors in proportion to the value of the real property included within the district in each county, such value to be determined from the equalized values of the last assessment rolls of the counties. When such division of the estimate has been made the directors shall furnish the boards of supervisors of the respective counties a written statement of that part of the estimates apportioned to each county.

#### Section 48-1915. Deposit and payment of district monies; investment and reinvestment of sinking fund

A. Monies received for a hospital district from any source shall be deposited with the county treasurer of the organizing county to the credit of the hospital district, and paid out only on warrants approved by the board of directors of the district.

4. Bonds, notes or evidences of indebtedness issued by any municipal improvement district in this state to finance local improvements authorized by law, if the principal and interest of such obligations are payable from assessments on real property within such a local improvement district. No such investment shall be made if the face value of all such obligations, and similar obligations outstanding, exceed fifty percent of the market value of the real property and improvements on which such bonds or the assessments for the payment of principal and interest thereon are liens inferior only to the liens for general ad valorem property taxes. Such an investment shall be made only if no default in payment of principal or interest on the obligations to be purchased has occurred within five years of the date of investment therein, or, if such obligations were issued less than five years prior to the date of investment, no default in payment of principal or interest has occurred on the obligations to be purchased, nor on any other obligation of the issuer within five years of such an investment.

B. When a capital outlay fund is established, it shall be used only for capital outlay purposes, but the board of directors may, by a four - fifths vote of all members, if it finds that the fund is no longer necessary or that there remain in the fund monies which are no longer required for capital outlay purposes, discontinue the fund or transfer as much of it as is no longer required for capital outlay purposes to the payment of outstanding bonds, or if there are none, to any fund for payment of current expenses of the district.

#### Section 48-2001.01. Merger of sanitary districts; hearing; election; joint meeting; resolution

A. For any two or more sanitary districts that are proposed to merge, the county board of supervisors shall hold a hearing on the proposed merger if either of the following applies:

1. The county board of supervisors has received a petition containing the signatures of at least twenty-five per cent of the qualified electors in each of the affected districts and proposing the merger of the sanitary districts.  The county board of supervisors shall verify the petitions in the same manner provided in section 48-903 and shall hold a public hearing on the merger at a time and place determined by the county board of supervisors.

2. The board of directors of each of the affected sanitary districts has adopted by a two-thirds vote a resolution requesting the merger of the districts and each has filed that resolution with the county board of supervisors.  On receipt of the resolutions, the county board of supervisors shall hold a public hearing on the merger at a time and place determined by the county board of supervisors.

B. The petition or resolutions shall contain the name and a description of the boundaries of the proposed district and a detailed, accurate map of the area to be included in the district and shall specify that the proposed district will be administered by a district board. No new territory may be included as a result of the merger, but the merged district may thereafter expand as provided in this chapter.

C. If the proposed district is located in more than one county, the petition or resolutions shall be submitted to the board of supervisors of the county in which the majority of the assessed valuation of the proposed merged district is located.  The boards of supervisors of any other counties in which the affected districts are located shall provide information and assistance to the responsible board of supervisors.

D. If the county board of supervisors determines after a public hearing that the proposed merger would serve the public convenience, welfare or necessity, the county board of supervisors shall call an election for a vote of the public on the question of the merger of the sanitary districts.  The board of supervisors shall not call an election to merge sanitary districts more frequently than once every two years.  The order shall not be entered until the petitioners or the boards of directors of the sanitary districts have deposited with the board of supervisors sufficient monies, not exceeding one thousand dollars, to defray the expense of the election.  These monies shall be paid out on the order of the board of supervisors.  If the sanitary districts are merged, the depositors of these monies shall be reimbursed from the merged sanitary districts' monies.  Whether or not the districts are merged, the sanitary districts shall reimburse the county for the expenses of the election.

E. For any election called pursuant to this section, the words appearing on the ballot shall be "(insert sanitary districts' names) merge as a sanitary district -- yes" and "(insert sanitary districts' names) merge as a sanitary district -- no".

F. Within fourteen days after the election, the board of supervisors shall meet and canvass the returns, and if it is determined that a majority of the votes cast at the election in each of the affected districts is in favor of merging the sanitary districts, the board shall enter that fact on its minutes.

G.

H. Section 48-262 does not apply to a merger of sanitary districts under this section.

 

#### Section 48-2002. Annexation of noncontiguous property

A. If the statement described in section 48-262, subsection A requests the annexation of property located within an incorporated city or town but not encompassing all the territory within the boundaries of the city or town, in addition to the other requirements of section 48-262, subsection A, the governing body shall approve the district boundary change impact statement and authorize the circulation of petitions only if the governing body of the city or town has by ordinance or resolution endorsed the annexation and the annexation is authorized pursuant to this title.

B. The area within the proposed change does not have to be contiguous to any boundary of the sanitary district to which it is annexed provided that the property between the sanitary district and the proposed area to be annexed belongs to the United States, the state of Arizona or the county wherein the district lies, or is a parcel or parcels of undeveloped land which is not susceptible of feasibly being provided sewer service by any other public or private entity presently providing such sewer service within five miles from the location of the property. The sanitary district may pay the costs of the extension of its sewer lines across the intervening public land not within the sanitary district. The extension shall occur at the discretion of the board.

C. In addition to the provisions of subsection A of this section, if the noncontiguous property to be annexed is within an urbanized area, the governing body shall obtain the approval, by resolution, from each city or town adjacent to or near by the urbanized area prior to the urbanized area's annexation. For the purposes of this subsection, "urbanized area" means the area within three miles of a city or town with a population of less than five thousand persons according to the most recent United States decennial census or within six miles of a city or town with a population of five thousand persons or more according to the most recent United States decennial census.

 

#### Section 48-2003. Annexation of all the territory within a city or town

A. Notwithstanding section 48-2002, if a city or town desires to have annexed all the territory located within such city or town, or if a portion of the city or town lies within the sanitary district, the remaining territory within such city or town, to a sanitary district, and the sanitary district, by resolution duly adopted by the board of directors, desires to annex such territory, the annexation shall be as set forth in this section.

B. The sanitary district shall first adopt a resolution setting forth its intention to annex all or the remaining portion of the territory within the corporate boundaries of a city or town.

The election shall be conducted and held in substantially the same manner as an election held pursuant to section 9-514.

C. If a majority of the qualified electors voting at the election votes in favor of the annexation, as evidenced by the official canvass, the board of directors of the sanitary district by resolution may declare and order the territory included within the boundaries of the city or town annexed to the sanitary district.

D. On annexation of all of the territory included within a city or town to a sanitary district, the sanitary district has all of the powers and authority over such territory as it has over any other territory within a sanitary district and the city or town shall not authorize, institute, establish, make or carry on a competing sewer service nor engage in the collection or treatment of sewage within the city or town.

#### Section 48-2010. Board of directors; qualifications; term; appointment; election; conversion; reorganization; compensation; expenses

A. A sanitary district having an area of one hundred sixty acres or more shall be governed by a board of directors with not less than three members. Members of the board of directors shall be qualified electors of the district.

The dates of elections and of expiration of terms of the initial directors shall be specified in the petition for establishment of the district.  Except for an election to reorganize a sanitary district, candidates for directors shall file nominating petitions with the board of supervisors as prescribed by title 16, chapter 3.  If only one person files or no person files a nominating petition for an election to fill a district office, the board of supervisors may cancel the election for the position and appoint the person who filed the nominating petition to fill the position. If no person files a nominating petition for an election to fill a district office, the board of supervisors may cancel the election for that office and that office is deemed vacant and shall be filled as otherwise provided by law.  A person who is appointed pursuant to this section is fully vested with the powers and duties of the office as if elected to that office.

B. A director who resides in an area which is deleted from the sanitary district during the director's term of office shall continue to serve until the next regular election, and until the director's successor is elected and qualified. If the director's term does not expire at that time, a new qualified director shall be elected to serve out the unexpired portion.

C. A sanitary district having an area of less than one hundred sixty acres shall be governed by the board of supervisors of the county in which the district is located, and the board of supervisors shall be the board of directors of the district. On receipt of a petition that contains the signatures of twenty-five per cent or more of the qualified electors residing in the district that are verified by the county recorder and that requests that the district be converted and administered by its own board of directors, the board of supervisors shall call an election on the conversion of the sanitary district. The election may be held on any consolidated election date as prescribed in section 16-204.  The sanitary district shall reimburse the county for the expenses of the sanitary district election.  The petition for the conversion of the district shall specify either three or five as the number of directors for the converted sanitary district. The board of supervisors shall give notice of the election by posting copies of the order of election in three public places within the district not less than twenty days prior to the date of the election and if a newspaper is published within the county having a general circulation within the district, the order shall be published in the newspaper not less than once a week during each of the three calendar weeks preceding the calendar week of the election. The ballot for the election shall state "convert from a sanitary district administered by the county board of supervisors to a sanitary district administered by a local board of directors consisting of (insert three members or five members, as appropriate) - yes", "convert from a sanitary district administered by the county board of supervisors to a sanitary district administered by a local board of directors consisting of (insert three or five members, as appropriate) - no". The ballot shall also allow each elector to indicate the elector's choice for board members in the event of conversion. Within twenty days after the election, the board of supervisors shall meet and canvass the returns, and if it is determined that a majority of the votes cast at the election were in favor of converting the sanitary district, the board shall enter that fact on its minutes, declare the district duly converted and announce the names of those elected to the district board.

D. The board of supervisors shall make an order calling an election to decide whether to reorganize a sanitary district that has a board consisting of three members as a sanitary district that has a board consisting of five members when a petition containing the signatures of twenty-five per cent of the qualified electors residing within the district and requesting that the district be reorganized is filed with the board except the board of supervisors shall not call for a reorganization election to expand the number of directors on the district board more frequently than once every two years. The election may be held on any consolidated election date as prescribed in section 16-204.  The sanitary district shall reimburse the county for the expenses of the sanitary district election.  The board of supervisors shall give notice of the election by posting copies of the order of election in three public places within the district not less than twenty days prior to the date of the election and if a newspaper is published within the county having a general circulation within the district, the order shall be published in the newspaper not less than once a week during each of the three calendar weeks preceding the calendar week of the election.  The ballot for the election shall state "shall the current three member sanitary district board be reorganized to a five member board - yes or no".  The ballot shall also allow each elector to indicate the elector's choice for two additional board members in the event of reorganization.  Within twenty days after the election, the board of supervisors shall meet and canvass the returns, and if it is determined that a majority of the votes cast at the election were in favor of reorganizing the sanitary district as a district with a five member board, the board shall enter that fact on its minutes, declare the district duly reorganized and announce the names of those elected to the district board.

E. Each director of a sanitary district shall receive not more than one hundred fifty dollars per month or a lesser amount as set by the board of directors of the district plus necessary traveling expenses, but members of the board of supervisors when serving as directors of a sanitary district shall receive no compensation for attending meetings but shall be reimbursed for their necessary expenses. No director shall receive compensation, other than expenses, for attending more than four meetings of the board during a calendar month.

F. For a district that is not governed by the board of supervisors, if a vacancy occurs on the district board due to death, disability, resignation or any other cause, the board of directors of the sanitary district shall appoint a qualified elector of the district to fill the office for the remaining portion of that term, except that if the remaining directors do not constitute a quorum, the county board of supervisors shall make the appointment to fill the vacancy.

These costs may be included in the levy or assessment amounts pledged to repay the financial assistance.  Districts are bound by and shall fully perform the loan repayment agreements, and the agreements are incontestable after the loan is funded by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona. The sanitary district shall also agree to pay the authority's costs in issuing bonds or otherwise borrowing to fund a loan.

The financial assistance loan repayment agreement may provide for different due dates for annual installments of principal, different interest payment dates, different dates of delinquency and different dates for holding sales of delinquent properties than otherwise provided for in article 2 of this chapter. The financial assistance loan repayment agreement may also provide for mailed notice to property owners in lieu of the publication requirement prescribed by sections 48-2068 and 48-2069.

I.

C. The bonds may be issued in denominations as the board of directors determines, except that no bond shall be of a denomination less than five hundred nor more than ten thousand dollars. Each bond shall be signed by the chairman of the board of directors and countersigned by the auditor of the sanitary district, and the seal of the district shall be affixed thereto. The interest coupons of the bonds, if any, shall be numbered consecutively and shall be signed by the chairman of the board of directors and the auditor of the district by their engraved or lithographed signatures. If any officer whose signature or countersignature appears on a bond or interest coupon ceases to be such officer, either before or after delivery of the bond to the purchaser, the signature or countersignature shall be valid for all purposes as if the officer had remained in office.

D. The validity of the bonds, after their issuance, shall not be questioned in any court, except on the ground that a provision of this article authorizing their issuance is unconstitutional or that proper notice of the bond election was not given.

E. When bonds have been issued by a sanitary district and the proceeds of the sale thereof have been expended as authorized by this article, the board of directors may, by resolution passed by a vote of at least two-thirds of its members, determine that additional bonds for carrying out the purposes of the district should be issued.

#### Section 48-2024. Tax exemption of bonds

Bonds issued pursuant to this article are not taxable by the state or by any county, city, town or other subdivision of the state.

#### Section 48-2025. Tax levy to pay principal and interest of bonds

A. The principal of and interest on bonds issued pursuant to this article shall be paid from revenue derived from an annual tax on the real property and mobile homes within the sanitary district issuing them, and such real property and mobile homes shall remain liable to taxes for payment of the bonds and interest until paid in full.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A, the board of directors of the district may provide that all or a portion of the district's annual revenue derived from sources other than taxes levied pursuant to this section may be used to pay principal and interest on bonds. So long as all principal, interest or sinking fund payments are current, the amount of the annual levy for payment of principal and interest may be reduced by the amount derived from other sources which are pledged or made available for the payment of principal and interest in such fiscal year. Whenever the district fails, in any fiscal year, to pay the required principal and interest or meet any required sinking fund payment, the difference may be made up by an emergency levy in the current fiscal year and, if not so made up, shall be included in a required levy the forthcoming fiscal year.

C. The board of directors of a sanitary district shall annually, on or before August 15, certify to the board of supervisors the amount necessary to pay interest on and the portion of principal which will become due on bonds of the district during the ensuing year.

D. The board of supervisors, at the time of levying general county taxes, shall levy and cause to be collected in the manner prescribed by law for county taxes, a tax upon the real property and mobile homes within the sanitary district, based upon the current assessment roll, sufficient to pay the amount certified by the board of directors. If the board of directors of a sanitary district fails to certify to the board of supervisors the amount necessary, the board of supervisors shall ascertain the amount which should have been certified and shall levy and cause to be collected a tax sufficient to produce that amount.

E. The tax, when collected, shall be paid into the county treasury to the credit of the bond fund of the sanitary district, and shall be used solely for payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds. The county treasurer shall pay the principal and interest on the dates and at the places specified in the bonds in the manner provided by law for the payment of principal of and interest on county bonds.

#### Section 48-2026. Tax levy for current expenses

A. The board of directors of a sanitary district may at the time of certifying the amount required for payment of principal of and interest on bonds, certify to the board of supervisors the amount necessary to maintain, operate, extend and repair the sewerage system and the garbage disposal and treatment plants of the district during the ensuing year, and to defray all other expenses incidental to the exercise of powers granted by this article, together with an estimate of the revenue which will be received from rentals and service charges. In that event, the board of supervisors shall, at the time of levying general county taxes, levy and cause to be collected in the manner prescribed by law for county taxes, a tax on real property and mobile homes within the sanitary district based on the current assessment roll, sufficient to pay the amount certified, less the amount estimated to be received from rentals and service charges.

B. The tax, when collected, shall be paid into the county treasury to the credit of the operating fund of the sanitary district, and the board of directors may order expenditure of the fund for the purposes for which levied. Payments from the operating fund shall be made upon claims allowed by the board of directors, prepared, presented and audited in the same manner as claims against the county.

C. Not less than twenty nor more than thirty days prior to making the certification to the board of supervisors provided by subsection A, the board of directors shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation in the district, an itemized statement of the amounts proposed to be certified, and the statement shall contain notice of a meeting to be held by the board of directors prior to the time for the certification. At that meeting, any owner of real property or a mobile home within the district may appear and present objections to any item of the amount proposed to be certified.

#### Section 48-2027. Fees, rentals and service charges; reserve fund; investments; lien

A. The board of directors of a sanitary district may charge and collect fees, including the fees listed in subsection G of this section, and sewer rentals and service charges for any service performed or property furnished by the district.

B. The board of directors may charge and collect fees and service charges for any plan reviews, site evaluations, construction inspections, monitoring inspections, follow-up inspections and any other service performed by the department of environmental quality if the sanitary district and the department of environmental quality have entered into an intergovernmental agreement pursuant to title 11, chapter 7, article 3 in which the department of environmental quality has agreed to provide any of such services in the sanitary district, except that:

1. Such fees and service charges shall not exceed the actual cost of performing such services.

2. State agencies are exempt from paying such fees and service charges.

3. Fees shall not be charged or collected by both the department of environmental quality and a sanitary district for the same service.

C. Revenue collected under subsections A and B of this section shall be paid into the county treasury to be credited first to the bond fund of the district to be used in the payment of principal and interest on the bonds if the proceedings relative to the issuance of the bonds provide for a pledge of such revenues or if the district has budgeted all or a portion of such revenues to the payment of the bonds in the certificate submitted to the board of supervisors pursuant to section 48-2025, subsection C and, second, to the operating fund of the district.

D. The proceedings relative to the issuance of any bonds may provide for a pledge of all or any part of the revenues of the district derived from any source other than taxes levied pursuant to section 48-2025 as additional security and source of payment of all or any specific issue of the district's bonds. The pledge shall be supplemental to and not in lieu of the liability of all taxable real property for the payment of the bonds. The pledge may be secured by an assignment of all or a part of such revenues to a bank doing business in this state. The treasurer may be instructed by the board of directors of the district to make monthly, semiannual or annual payments to such bank to provide for payment of the bonds and coupons as the same shall mature. When revenues are assigned to a bank for payment, such bank may be named as a paying agent on the bonds and coupons so secured in lieu of the county treasurer, and in that event, the county treasurer shall remit any taxes collected pursuant to section 48-2025 to such paying agent in time for prompt payment of maturing bonds and coupons.

E. The proceedings for the issuance of bonds may provide for a reserve fund in a sum found by the board of directors of the district to be sufficient to secure payment of maturing principal and interest in the event of a deficiency. The reserve fund may be funded from either bond proceeds or revenues available for that purpose in any fiscal year after provision has been made for payment of principal and interest and operating costs. The district may covenant to maintain the reserve fund throughout the life of any bonds. Whenever the annual revenues are insufficient to meet maturing principal or interest or sinking fund payments in any fiscal year, the reserve fund shall be exhausted prior to the making of an emergency levy.

F. Upon direction of the board of directors of the district, monies held in any fund may be invested by the county treasurer or the bank acting as assignee under any pledge in any securities or obligations qualifying as investments for state monies under section 35-324.

G. Fees which the district may charge pursuant to this section include:

1. User fees, which are proportional shares of the cost of the operation, maintenance and replacement of the wastewater collection, treatment and effluent disposal system.

2. Hookup fees for connection to the district sewer system, not including the cost of the actual physical connection.

3. A lateral fee, which is a fee for the cost of constructing a sewer lateral from the property line of the user to the middle of the easement or right-of-way in which the sewer is located.

4. A capacity fee based on the cost of developing the sewage collection, treatment and effluent disposal facilities required to treat the flow of sewage which enters the sewage system from a particular sewer connection.

5. An availability fee, which is a charge levied against all property in the district which is not connected to the sewer system but which lies adjacent to a sewer line for the benefit to that particular parcel of property of having the sewer line and capacity in the treatment works and effluent disposal facilities to accommodate the development of the property. The availability fee shall be no more than fifty per cent of the user fee.

6. A late fee if the payment of any fee prescribed by this section is delinquent for more than fifteen days.

H. All fees shall be initially determined and annually reviewed by the board of directors following a public hearing at which all interested persons may appear and be heard on any matter relating to the amount of the fees or the method of determining the fees. Not less than twenty or more than thirty days before the public hearing the board of directors shall publish a notice of the time and place of the hearing and a statement of the rates to be considered or reviewed. Any person wishing to object to the establishment or continuation of the rates, before the date set for the hearing, may file the objection with the chairman of the board of directors.

I. A sanitary district may file a lien on property for the nonpayment of user fees for services provided to the property if the payment of the fees is delinquent for more than ninety days.

J. Before filing the lien, the sanitary district shall provide written notice to the owner of the property. The notice shall be given at least thirty days before filing the lien and shall include an opportunity for a hearing with a designated sanitary district official. The notice shall be either personally served or mailed to the property owner, at the last known address by certified mail, or to the address to which the tax bill for the property was last mailed. If the owner does not reside on the property, the notice shall be sent to the last known address.

K. The unpaid user fees, from the date of recording in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the property is located, are a lien on the property until the fees are paid. The lien is subject and inferior to the lien for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages and encumbrances of record. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under this section shall be made on judgment of foreclosure and order of sale. A sanitary district may bring an action to enforce the lien in the superior court in the county in which the property is located at any time after the recording, but failure to enforce the lien by this action does not affect its validity. The recorded unpaid user fees are prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited in the recording and of the regularity of all proceedings before the recording.

L. Unpaid user fees including any late fees assessed pursuant to this section accrue interest at the rate prescribed by section 44-1201.

M. A prior assessment of unpaid user fees for the purposes provided in this section does not bar a subsequent assessment for these purposes and any number of liens on the same lot or tract of land may be enforced in the same action.

N. The sanitary district shall determine the status of leased residential property before filing a lien pursuant to subsection I of this section and a lien may not be filed if both of the following apply:

1. The lessee of the leased residential property has agreed in writing to be responsible for those fees.

2. The owner of the leased residential property has recorded a copy of the written agreement of the lessee's responsibility for payment of the user fees pursuant to this section.  The copy of the written agreement shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the residential property is located.

#### Section 48-2028. Dissolution of sanitary district

A. A sanitary district organized under this article, which has no bonded indebtedness and when all legal indebtedness of the district has been discharged, may be dissolved on the vote of a majority of the qualified electors of the district at a special election called by the board of directors upon the question of dissolution. If a majority of the votes cast favors dissolution, the board of directors shall by resolution declare the district dissolved, and thereupon the district is dissolved. A certified copy of the resolution shall, within fifteen days after its adoption, be filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors of the county in which the district is situated.

B. Upon dissolution of a sanitary district the property of the district which is located within the corporate limits of a city or town shall vest in that city or town. Other property of the district shall vest in the county. Any funds of the district at the time of dissolution shall be transferred to the incorporated city or town and to the county in proportion to the assessed valuation of taxable real property within the city or town and within the county, respectively, as it appears on the current assessment roll.

C. If after dissolution of a sanitary district, it is found that there remains unpaid a legal indebtedness of the district, the board of supervisors of the county in which the district was located shall levy a tax upon the real property and mobile homes within the district as it existed at the time of dissolution, sufficient to meet the indebtedness and interest thereon, and shall pay the indebtedness and interest from the proceeds of the tax.

D. In the case of a district to which section 9-101.02 applies, the election on dissolution held in conjunction with the election on incorporation of the city or town shall be deemed to be the election required by this section, so that when the other conditions of subsection A of this section shall have been satisfied, the district shall be dissolved.

#### Section 48-2029. Alternate methods of dissolution of sanitary district

A. A sanitary district organized under this article, the territory of which is wholly or partially included within the corporate limits of a city or town, may be dissolved in the following manner provided the dissolution is approved by a resolution or ordinance passed by the board of directors of the sanitary district and by the governing body of the city or town:

3. Within thirty days after the date of the passage of the latter of the ordinances or resolutions called for in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, the governing body of the city or town shall call a special election of the city or town on the question of whether to accept the trusteeship of the sanitary district. The election shall take place on such date as the governing body may designate but not more than sixty days after the ordinance or resolution calling the election is passed, except that no such election shall be called within twelve months from the date of a previous election called for the same purpose. Only qualified electors of the city or town shall vote on the question.

4. When, on the basis of the adoption of the ordinances or resolutions under paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, an election is called upon the question of acceptance of the trusteeship under paragraph 3 of this subsection, the governing body of the sanitary district shall also call, at the same time as the election provided for in paragraph 3 of this subsection is called, a separate election among the qualified electors of the sanitary district on the question of dissolution of the district. For the purposes of such election, a qualified elector of the district shall be a person who is qualified to vote at the election called pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection and who resides on property within the district.

B. If a majority of qualified electors of the city or town voting on the question approves it, and a majority of the qualified electors of the district voting on the question approves it, the district shall be dissolved as provided in this section. If the qualified electors voting in the election conducted pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section fail to accept the trusteeship or if the qualified electors voting in the election conducted pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 4 of this section fail to approve dissolution, the sanitary district shall not be dissolved and the proceedings shall be terminated.

C. If the sanitary district has no bonded indebtedness or when all legal indebtedness of the district has been discharged or assumed by the city or town, after otherwise complying with the provisions of this section, the governing body of the city or town shall as trustees of the district by resolution declare the district dissolved, and thereupon the district shall be dissolved.

1. No protests against the work or no objections as to the extent of the proposed assessment district have been filed within the prescribed time.

2. The board finds a protest to be insufficient in that it does not contain the signatures required or the objections to the extent of the proposed district have been heard and denied and no action requesting review of the board's decision on protests against the proposed improvements is pending or all actions for review of the board's decision have been finally resolved in favor of the board's decision.

B. The resolution ordering the improvement need not fully describe the improvement or the extent of the assessment district but may refer to the resolution of intention for the description.

C. The board shall publish a notice of the passage of the resolution ordering the improvement and inviting sealed bids from persons interested in constructing the improvement twice in one or more daily newspapers or once in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper of general circulation in the sanitary district.

D. The sanitary district may contract with this state or the governing body of the governmental entity to which the lot belongs for payment to the district of the assessment and interest as they become due and payable, and the state or such body shall perform the contract.

#### Section 48-2051. Payment of costs by sanitary district

A. The board may order in the resolution of intention that all or part of the cost of any work shall be paid from the treasury of the sanitary district from the fund it designates when so ordered.

C. If the resolution of intention to make the improvement and the resolution ordering the work have provided for alternative plans and specifications and the notice has invited separate bids pursuant to the alternative plans and specifications, the board shall not award the contract for the improvement until fifteen days after the bids have been opened, examined and declared. If, within such period, the owners of a majority of the property fronting on the proposed improvement, or if the cost of the improvement is made chargeable on a district, the owners of a majority of the frontage of the property in the assessment district, in writing, require that the proposed improvement be constructed according to one of the alternative plans and specifications, the board shall so determine and require and shall award the contract to the lowest and best responsible bidder. If no such written requirement is filed, the board shall determine which of the alternative plans and specifications to adopt, considering cost and efficiency, and shall award the contract accordingly.

All objections to any act or proceeding which are not made before the notice of the award are deemed to be waived, except as to matters directly affecting the authority of the board. If the board finds any objection to be valid, it may abandon the proceedings, correct or modify any portion of the proceedings or proceed as in the first instance.

F. Within twenty days after the date of the first publication, if no objections have been filed, the successful bidder shall enter into a contract to make the improvement according to his bid.

A bidder who fails to enter into the contract is liable on his bond accompanying the bid for all costs and damages incurred and sustained by reason of the failure to enter into the contract.

#### Section 48-2053. Option of sanitary district to reject bids; sanitary district as contractor; limitation of assessment

The board may, within ten days after the time fixed for opening bids, by resolution adopted by a vote of two-thirds of its members, order that the proposed contract not be entered into and that the sanitary district itself perform the work according to the plans and specifications as adopted for the work. If it is so ordered, the district shall be considered the contractor.

D. If the work is not performed with diligence, the board, after a hearing and service of notice on the contractor and the contractor's surety, may prescribe such terms and conditions as it deems proper before allowing the contractor to continue with the work.

E. If the board finds that the contractor is unable to continue with the work or to perform the work according to the contract, the board shall hold the contractor in default and make demand on the surety to act according to the contract and the terms and conditions of the performance bond. If the surety fails to act within sixty days after the date of the written notice, the board may order that bids be received from other contractors to complete the work. After receiving bids, the board may award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder. If, after receiving the new bids, the cost of completion exceeds the monies or bonds available for payment, the board shall make a demand on the defaulting contractor's surety for payment of the difference within twenty days of the mailing of the notice. If the surety is represented by an attorney-in-fact, the demand may be served on the attorney-in-fact or at the surety's principal office in this state. If the surety has no attorney-in-fact and no principal office in this state, the demand shall be served on the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions. The demand may not exceed the penal sum of the performance bond. Monies collected from the surety shall be used to pay the added costs of the work. Any difference between the actual costs of the work and the amount assessed shall be advanced by the district, which shall use its contingency fund or any other available monies to pay the new contractor. The district shall reimburse itself from the amounts paid by the former contractor or the contractor's surety or from assessments and bonds when monies become available. All additional costs of the work not received from the original contractor's surety shall ultimately be assessed against the benefitting parcels of property.

#### Section 48-2057. Diagrams of property affected; estimate of benefits; assessment; warrant

A. The engineer shall make duplicate diagrams of the property fronting on the proposed improvement or in the assessment district if the expenses of the proposed improvement are to be assessed on a district. The diagrams shall show each separate lot, numbered consecutively, the approximate area in square feet of each lot and the location of the lot in relation to the work proposed to be done.

B. When the diagrams have been approved, certified and dated by the board, the diagrams shall be filed with the sanitary district.

C. At any time after bids have been received for the construction of the work or the district has entered into a contract to purchase an existing facility, the district shall estimate on the lots fronting on the work if no assessment district has been established, or if an assessment district has been established, on each of the lots in the district, the benefits arising, or expected to arise, from the work. It shall thereupon make an assessment to cover the amount due for the work performed and specified in the bid of the person to whom the contract was awarded, including incidental expenses, and shall assess against the lots the total amount of the costs and expenses of the work. In so doing the district shall assess the total amount on the several lots, each respectively in proportion to the benefits to be received by each lot.

D. If the work has not been declared by the resolution of intention to be of more than local or ordinary public benefit and has not been made assessable on a district, the lots liable to be assessed for the improvement are those fronting on the improvement and those benefited by the improvement.

E. The assessment shall cover the amount due for the work performed as specified in the bid of the person to whom the contract may be awarded and shall also include incidental expenses. The incidental expenses shall include the compensation of the sanitary district engineer for work done by him, the cost of printing, advertising and posting, the compensation of the person appointed by the district to take charge of and superintend the construction of the improvement, the expenses of making the assessment, the interest on the bonds for a period not longer than the expected period of construction and six months beyond and all legal and financial fees, expenses and costs incurred in drafting the proceedings, in the sale of the bonds and the connection fees to connect the sewer lines to the main trunk lines of the district and administering the work. The amount of incidental expenses shall be settled and allowed by the board on presentation of verified itemized bills.

F. The assessment shall briefly refer to the award of the contract or to the contract if it has then been executed and shall name the person to whom the contract has been awarded and such person's surety, the amount to be paid as stated in the winning bid or as finally computed by the engineer, if the assessment is not made until the work is completed, the incidental expenses, the amount of each assessment, the name of the owner of each lot, if known, and if unknown the word "unknown" shall be written opposite the number of the assessment, together with the amount assessed on the lot. The district shall list the names of owners as shown on the most recent certified county assessment roll and any other person of whom the district has personal knowledge that such other person may be the owner of the respective lot. The assessments on the lots shall be consecutively numbered and the diagram shall be numbered to correspond with the assessment numbers.

G. A warrant shall be attached to the assessment signed by the chairman of the board, which shall be substantially in the following form: By virtue hereof, I (name of chairman of board of directors), of the (name of sanitary district and county), and state of Arizona, by virtue of the authority vested in me as chairman, do authorize and empower (name of contractor or the treasurer or other person nominated by the board), his agents or assigns to demand and receive the several assessments on the assessment hereto attached, and this shall be his warrant for the same.

H. The warrant and assessment shall be recorded in the district's office, and one diagram shall be filed, not earlier than the date of execution of the contract or the date of the sale of any bonds, whichever first occurs. When so recorded, the several amounts assessed are a first lien on the lots assessed subject only to the lien for general property taxes and prior special assessments for a period terminating on the date the assessment against the respective lot is paid in full, and the recording constitutes notice to all persons interested in the contents of the record.

#### Section 48-2058. Delivery of warrant and assessment to contractor; demand for payment; release of assessments; review of assessment

A. After the warrant and assessment are recorded, they shall be delivered to the contractor, or to the sanitary district if it charges itself with the duty of making demands for the payment, together with one of the diagrams. By virtue of the warrant, the contractor or the district, as the case may be, may demand and receive the amount of the several assessments.

B. The contractor, treasurer or other person nominated by the board, as the case may be, shall call on the person assessed, either in person or by mail if the person can conveniently be found, and demand payment, and if paid the contractor or treasurer or other person nominated by the board shall provide a receipt. The receipt, when presented to the district, constitutes an order to it to release the assessment.

C. The contractor, treasurer or other person nominated by the board shall promptly notify the district of all payments made to him, whereupon the district shall release assessments which have been fully paid. If the name of the owner of the lot is stated as "unknown" on the assessment, the contractor or treasurer or other person nominated by the board shall demand payment of a person in possession of the lot. If someone is in possession, the demand may be made either by mail, if a mailing address for the person in possession can be determined, or in person. If the premises are unoccupied or the person in possession cannot be found, the demand is unnecessary.

D. The warrant shall be returned to the board within thirty days after its date endorsed with "return", signed by the contractor or treasurer or other person nominated by the board, as the case may be, verified on oath and stating the nature and character of the demand, and whether any assessments remain wholly or partially unpaid, and the amount of the unpaid assessment. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, the verified statement of the person making the return is conclusive proof that the demand for payment was made on each owner, each person in possession or each parcel of property as required by this section. The board shall record the return so made in the margin of the record of the warrant and assessment. After return of the assessment and warrant all amounts remaining due draw interest at the rate of eight per cent a year until paid or, on the issuance of bonds, at the rate specified in the bonds payable for the semiannual period specified in the bonds notwithstanding that the installments of assessments may be due at dates earlier than installments of interest are payable on the bonds.

E. On recording the assessment and warrant, the board shall fix a time when it will hear and pass on the assessment and the proceedings taken, which shall not be fewer than twenty days from the date of the recording. The board shall cause notice of the hearing to be published for five days in a daily newspaper, or two times in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper, of general circulation in the sanitary district and shall cause notices of the time and place of the hearing to be mailed by first class mail, at least twenty days before the hearing date, to all persons owning real property affected by the assessments as their names and addresses appear on the last certified property tax roll. If no address appears for a person on the last certified tax roll, no notice need be mailed to that person. The chairman of the board shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall state that the persons to whom notices were mailed constitute all persons whose names and addresses appear on the tax roll as owning property in the improvement area. The affidavit is conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed. The failure to receive notice does not constitute any jurisdictional defect invalidating a district proceeding or assessment if notice has been sent pursuant to this section.

F. The owners, contractor and all other persons directly interested in the work or in the assessment, who have any objection to the amount or legality of the assessment or to any of the previous proceedings or who claim that the work has not been performed according to the contract, may, before the time fixed for the hearing, file a written notice briefly specifying the grounds of their objections. At the time fixed for the hearing or at any time not later than ten days thereafter, to which the hearing may be postponed, the board shall hear and pass on their objections. The decision of the board is final and conclusive on all persons entitled to object as to all errors, informalities and irregularities which the board may have remedied or avoided at any time during the progress of the proceedings.

G. After the hearing, if the board of directors finds that the assessment has not yet been fairly apportioned, it shall modify the amounts of the several assessments and may order that the assessment be recomputed if it finds that the benefits to any lots do not equal the amount of the lots' assessments. When recomputing the assessment, the board shall levy the reassessments according to the benefits derived, notwithstanding the fact that the reduction of any assessment may cause a corresponding increase in other assessments, except that without the written consent of the owner of land to be assessed, no assessment or assessments may be increased in a manner which causes the total assessment for all work and expenses to exceed the total amount stated on the engineer's official estimate.

H. At any time within one year after the date the district files the certificate of completion as provided in section 48-2065, subsection G, any member of the board of directors, any owner or any person claiming an interest in any lot which received an assessment may file a written notice with the clerk stating that the work has not been performed substantially according to the resolution of intention or the plans, specifications and estimate. The notice shall state in particular the contractor's failure to perform and may also state, if applicable, any requested reduction in the assessment of any one or more parcels due solely to the failure of such performance. The notice shall state the name and address of the person filing the notice and shall describe the person's interest in land subject to assessment, if applicable.

I. On receipt of such a notice, the board of directors shall set a date for a hearing on the notice. The board of directors shall give notice of the hearing to the contractor, the contractor's surety, the person appointed to take charge of and superintend the work and all persons whose names and addresses appear in the notice. In addition, the clerk shall cause a notice of the hearing to be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.

J. At the hearing, the board shall determine whether the work was completed according to the resolution of intention, the plans and specifications and any corrections or alterations of the plans deemed necessary. If the board determines that the work has not been so completed, it shall order the contractor to complete the work and shall set a reasonable time for completion and recess the hearing until the date set for completion. If, at the date set to reconvene the hearing, the evidence shows that the work is then completed, the board shall enter such findings on its minutes. If the board determines that the contractor is making a good faith attempt to complete the work, it may continue the completion date and recess the hearing to a later date. If, at the hearing or at any recessed hearing, the board of directors finds that the contractor refuses to complete or is incapable of completing the work, it shall order and the district's attorney shall bring an action against the contractor and its surety to collect such amounts or cause such performance as is necessary to complete the work.

K. If the board determines that for any reason the work cannot be completed and no recovery can be made against the contractor or the contractor's surety, the board may recompute the assessment, taking into consideration the effect the contractor's failure to perform may have had on the actual benefits derived from the improvement and reduce some or all assessments to reflect the reduced benefits. If the assessments are reduced, the district shall assume as a contingent liability any difference between the amounts thereafter received on the semiannual assessment payments and the amounts of principal and interest thereafter due on the bonds. The assumption of such amount becomes a general obligation of the district.

L. All decisions made concerning any notice filed pursuant to this section are final and conclusive as to the persons filing the notice, the contractor and the contractor's surety and as to the alleged defect in the work. After a ruling on any alleged defect in the work, the board shall not entertain or hear a later notice concerning the same defect, whether or not filed by a person other than the person filing the original notice.

M. After the work is completed, the district shall file a recomputed assessment based on the actual quantities determined by the engineer to have been constructed or installed, or the actual cost of the acquisition, as the case may be, together with the known incidental expenses paid to that date and the itemized estimated incidental expenses remaining to be paid. The engineer need not recompute each individual assessment but shall determine the amount of the increase or decrease to be assessed and shall file a supplemental statement with the clerk stating the ratio of the difference between the contractor's bid and the recapitulated amount and ordering that each assessment be increased or decreased, as the case may be, by that ratio. If the total assessment is decreased, the treasurer shall credit the amount of the decrease proportionately on the assessments remaining unpaid and return to the owner, if the owner can be located, that portion of each assessment previously paid in cash which represents an excess payment.

N. At the hearing provided pursuant to subsection E of this section the board shall receive and consider applications from individual lot or parcel owners for financial assistance in paying assessments. The application shall be in a form approved by the board and the applicant shall provide reasonable evidence that the applicant lacks the financial capability to pay the full assessment or the annual assessment installments. The board shall appropriate monies from any source to provide assistance for any person by having the sanitary district pay the individual assessment and have the applicant provide an instrument, secured by an encumbrance on the applicant's property, which provides for repayment to the sanitary district on less burdensome terms than the assessment or the annual assessment installments of the monies paid by the district. This subsection applies only to applicants who own fewer than three parcels or lots within the area to be assessed.

#### Section 48-2059. Action against property owner to collect assessment

A. If the district chooses not to issue bonds, or fails to issue bonds on completion of the work, at any time after thirty-five days from the date of the warrant or, if any objection filed with the board as provided in section 48-2058 is denied, at any time after five days from its decision, the contractor may sue the owner of the lot assessed and recover the amount of an assessment remaining unpaid with interest at the rate of eight per cent per annum until paid or foreclose the lien of the assessment.

B. If the district chooses not to issue bonds, or fails to issue bonds on the completion of the work, and if personal demand has been made and the owner has refused to pay the assessment so demanded, the plaintiff may recover reasonable attorney fees.

C. Only one action shall be begun to foreclose liens arising under a single proceeding against the same defendant.

D. The warrant, assessment and diagram, with the affidavit of demand and nonpayment, are prima facie evidence of the regularity and correctness of the assessment and of the prior proceedings and acts of the board on which the warrant, assessment and diagram are based and are also evidence of the right of the plaintiff to recover.

#### Section 48-2060. Invalidity of liens or bonds; extent of validity; means to secure interest of persons damaged

A. If the lien of an assessment or reassessment or of a bond issued to represent the amount assessed on any lot is held invalid by a court because a portion of the improvement ordered was not within the power of the board to order or was not properly embraced in the contract for the work or in the assessment made to cover the expenses, the owner of the warrant or the holder of the bond is entitled to a judgment determining what portion of the assessment is legal. The district shall, within sixty days and pursuant to the directions of the judgment, issue to him a new assessment for an amount which the court finds is the reasonable value of the portion of the improvement legally authorized by the proceedings, which amount shall be reassessed against the property in the same manner and with the same effect as provided for issuing the original assessment, and may be enforced as an original assessment. The holder of bonds representing the original assessment is entitled to new bonds on each lot representing the amount of the reassessment.

B. If the lien of an assessment, or of a bond issued for an assessment amount, is held invalid by a court for any cause arising after the authority of the board attaches to order the work, or if the lien is defeated or held invalid for any cause, and it also appears that the owner of the property, holding it at the time the notice of the award of the contract was published, had personal knowledge of the intention to order the award of the contract, and has not filed a protest against the improvement or a notice of his objection to the award of the contract, the owner of the assessment or bond may recover from the owner of the lot covered by the assessment such amount as the court finds the lot to have been actually benefited by the improvement, not exceeding the amount which would have been properly assessed against the lot.

#### Section 48-2061. Proportionate assessment; collection or issuance of bonds

The board may, on completion of any portion of the improvement for which the contract price equals twenty thousand dollars or more, order an assessment for the proportionate part of the contract completed, and the proportionate amount shall be collected as provided in this article. If the resolution of intention for the improvement provides for the issuance of improvement bonds, the bonds shall be issued and delivered to the contractor for the proportionate amount of the contract price so assessed.

#### Section 48-2062. Correctness of assessment; reallocation of assessment

A. After an assessment has been approved by the board, the contractor and all persons having an interest in any lot assessed may request the board, by a duly acknowledged written instrument, to modify or correct an assessment. The board may order such modification or correction of the assessment, on the record, together with the date it is made. The modification or correction under this subsection does not affect the rights of persons under the assessment who have not joined in the request.

B. The board may reallocate all or part of an assessment as follows:

1. The board shall prepare a list of all assessments to be reallocated, including:

(a) The assessment number, legal description and amount assessed on each affected parcel before the reallocation.

(b) The assessment number, legal description and name and address of the owner as shown on the most recent tax roll.

(c) The amount to be assessed on each parcel after reallocation.

2. The board shall prepare an amendment to the assessment diagram reflecting the new assessment numbers and parcel boundaries.

3. The board shall cause a notice to be mailed to each owner of an affected parcel showing the proposed reallocation and stating that the owner may file a written objection to the reallocation within twenty days after the notice was mailed.

4. If no objections are received within twenty days after the notice is mailed, the board may approve the proposed reallocation.  If timely objections are received, the board shall hold a hearing on the objections. The board shall mail notice of the hearing to all affected owners at least ten days before the hearing.  At the hearing the objecting parties shall present evidence supporting their objections.  After the hearing the board shall rule on all objections received and may approve the proposed reallocation or may make changes to the reallocation as the board considers necessary and approve the reallocation as changed.  The board shall also approve the amendment to the assessment diagram as submitted or with changes the board considers to be necessary.

5. The board shall issue an order on the record approving the reallocated assessment and amended assessment diagram.

6. The amount assessed immediately after the reallocation shall be equal to the amount assessed immediately before the reallocation.

7. As a condition to reallocation, the board may require the affected property owners to pay the costs of reallocation, including engineering and legal costs, or may include the costs in the amount assessed against the affected parcels.  The costs are due and payable as part of the next installment of the assessment.

 

#### Section 48-2063. Issuance of improvement bonds; fund for payment of bonds

A. The board may determine that improvement bonds shall be issued for the cost and expense of the improvement. The bonds shall be issued in the name of the sanitary district but shall be made payable only from the special fund collected by the sanitary district from special assessments levied and assessed on the lots fronting on the improvement and those benefited or, if an assessment district has been created by the resolution of intention for the work, on the lots included in the assessment district.

B. All amounts collected from the special assessment shall be placed in the special fund and shall not be used for any purpose other than payment of the principal and interest of the bonds.

#### Section 48-2064. Description of improvement bonds in resolution and notices

A. If the board decides to issue improvement bonds, it shall so declare in the resolution of intention for the work and shall specify the maximum rate of interest which the bonds shall bear. A similar description of the bonds shall be inserted in all notices of the proceedings required to be published or posted and a notice that the bonds will be paid from a special fund collected in not more than thirty annual installments from the assessments of twenty-five dollars or more remaining unpaid at the date of the issuance of the bonds or thirty days after the date of the warrant, or five days after the decision of the board on an objection, except that if the initial purchaser of the bonds is the United States of America or any department, division or agency of the United States of America, the bonds may mature over a period that does not exceed forty-one years and the bonds will be paid from a special fund collected in not more than forty-one annual installments. A description of the bonds shall be included in the warrant.

B. All other proceedings for the work up to and including the approval of the assessment by the board, including delivery of the assessment to the contractor, demand of payment of the several assessments and the return and recording, shall be conducted as provided in this article.

 

#### Section 48-2065. List of unpaid assessments; issuance of bonds; denominations; due date

A. After the prescribed time from the date of the warrant has expired and after the sanitary district has recorded the return, the board shall make and certify a complete list of all unpaid assessments that amount to twenty-five dollars or more on any assessment.

B. If any person, before certification of the list, presents to the board an affidavit that he is the owner of a lot on the list, accompanied by the certificate of a searcher of record that the person is the owner of record, and notifies the board, in writing, that he desires no bond to be issued for the assessment on the lot, the assessment shall not be included in the list and shall remain collectible as provided in this article. The failure to file the notice bars any defense against the bonds, except for the defense that the board did not have authority to issue the bonds.

C. The clerk shall present the list to the district at its next meeting after the return has been recorded. At any time after awarding a contract for construction or acquisition, the district by resolution, may direct improvement bonds to be issued in an amount, that shall not exceed the amount of unpaid assessments exceeding twenty-five dollars as may be shown on the certified list. The resolution shall prescribe the maximum number and denomination of the bonds, and the times when payable, which shall be so fixed that an approximately equal amount of principal shall be paid each year or any approximately equal aggregate amount of principal and interest shall be paid each year until the whole amount is paid. The bonds shall mature in a period that does not exceed thirty years and three months from the date of the bonds, except that if the initial purchaser of the bonds is the United States of America or any department, division or agency of the United States of America, the bonds may mature over a period that does not exceed forty-one years.  The denominations of the bonds shall be fixed by the district. The district may provide in the form of the bond for redemption before maturity by giving notice as the district determines to be reasonable and by the payment of a premium at redemption if the district determines a premium is advisable. The resolution shall also fix the place, if any, other than the office of the treasurer, at which the bonds and the interest are payable.

D. The bonds shall be issued as of the date determined by the district and shall bear interest from the date at the rate not more than that specified in the resolution of intention. They shall have semiannual interest payments, the first of which is payable on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, occurring no earlier than ninety days after the later of the date of the bond or the expected completion of the work, and shall be for the interest accrued at that time.

E. The due date of all bonds is January 1 or July 1, as stated on the face of the bonds, in the years in which they respectively become due.

F. The district may sell the bonds at public sale, or if the district has a population of more than two thousand persons and has been in existence for ten or more years at public or private sale, at a price at or above par and accrued interest to the date of payment, and at an interest rate not exceeding the maximum rate set in the resolution of intention. If the bonds are not sold by the district they shall be delivered to the contractor for the amount of the assessments remaining unpaid, and the bonds shall bear interest at the maximum interest rate set forth in the resolution of intention.

G. If the bonds are sold before the work or acquisition is completed, the proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the treasurer and to be used to pay incidental expenses and payments for construction or acquisition. Proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be used for the acquisition mentioned in the resolution of intention or to make semimonthly or monthly payments to the contractor on a basis of ninety per cent of the value of the work actually performed as estimated by the district or engineer employed for those purposes to and including the fifteenth or last day of each calendar month. The balance shall be paid after the district has recorded a certificate of substantial completion of the work described in the resolution of intention, in the same manner as the recording of the assessment. The district shall record the certificate after the work has been completed to its satisfaction. The district shall also cause a copy of the notice of completion to be mailed to each property owner in the same manner as the notice of hearing on the assessment. Pending use of the bond proceeds, the treasurer may invest the proceeds in any investments for which sinking funds of this state may be invested or in the pooled investment fund established under section 35-326. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if bond anticipation notes have been issued, the bond proceeds, or as much as are necessary, shall be used to redeem the notes.

H. Refunding bonds may be issued to refund all or any portion of an issue of bonds issued and sold pursuant to this section in the manner prescribed by title 35, chapter 3, article 4.

 

#### Section 48-2066. Form of bonds

A. The bonds shall be signed by the chairman of the board, attested by the secretary and sealed with the corporate seal of the district, and the interest coupons, if any, shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman and secretary of the district.

B. The bonds shall be substantially in the following form:

_____________________ sanitary district of __________________ improvement bond.

Know all men by these presents: that the _________________ sanitary district of _______________ county, Arizona, a duly organized municipal corporation, promises to pay as hereinafter stated to the bearer hereof, on the ________ day of ________________, 19____, the sum of _________________ dollars, together with interest on such sum, at the rate of ______________ per cent per annum, payable semiannually on January 1 and July 1 of each year. Both principal and interest are payable at the office of the _________________ county treasurer (or bond registrar) at the option of the holder. The bond is issued in pursuance of law and is one of a series of ____________________ bonds of like tenor and date for the total sum of ____________________ dollars issued for that certain improvement in such sanitary district consisting of

(Briefly describing improvement),

initiated by resolution no. ___________ of _______________ sanitary district, and is payable only out of the special fund to be collected from special assessments imposed on the lots or parcels of land fronting on or benefited by such improvement. Such special fund is set apart by law for the payment of such bonds and can be used for no other purpose. It is hereby certified and declared that the improvement for which this series of bonds is issued is authorized by law, that all the acts, conditions and things required to be done, precedent to and in the issuing of this series of bonds, have been done, or will be done, and performed in regular and due form as required by the law of this state and all resolutions of the sanitary district, that the special assessments out of which such bonds are to be paid are first liens on the property assessed, subject only to the lien for general taxes and prior special assessments, and any bona fide purchaser for value of this bond has the right to rely on the recitals contained in the bond. For the assessment or reassessment, collection and payment of such special assessments, the full faith and diligence of such sanitary district are hereby irrevocably pledged.

#### Section 48-2067. Certification of unpaid assessments; payments by installment; interest; payments in advance

A. The board, at the time it certifies the list of unpaid assessments, shall write the word "certified" on the record of the assessment opposite each unpaid assessment included in the list, and all assessments of twenty-five dollars or more cease to be payable in cash and are thereafter payable only in equal annual installments on January 1 of each year in which the bonds become due. The board may provide a plan by which the annual installment plus an additional over levy as determined by the board to cover the anticipated delinquencies in the collection of the assessment may be collected in partial payments before the installment is due, and the lien of each assessment on the property assessed is valid for two years after the last installment on the assessment becomes due, or until the assessment is fully paid.

B. An uncollected installment shall be added to the succeeding installment and paid, together with interest and penalties.

C. The number of installments in which the assessment is payable shall correspond to the number of years in which there are bonds to be paid. The total number of installments shall not exceed thirty, except that if the initial purchaser of the bonds is the United States of America or any department, division or agency of the United States of America, the bonds may mature over a period that does not exceed forty-one years and the total number of installments shall not exceed forty-one.

D. All assessments of twenty-five dollars or more not paid before the certification of the list of unpaid assessments bear interest from the date of the warrant at the same rate as that specified for the bonds in the resolution of intention. The interest is payable on July 1 and January 1 of each year, immediately before the interest becomes due on the bonds. The board may provide a plan by which the interest is collected in partial payments before the date it becomes due.

E. The board may provide for receiving payment of the installments of the assessments before they become due and may use the proceeds to redeem the bonds presented for redemption by the bond owners or invest the proceeds in improvement bonds for other work or other satisfactory investment. Investment of these monies may not be made so as to prejudice the prompt payment of the bonds on the date they become due.

 

#### Section 48-2068. Collection of assessment installments; notice; delinquent installments

A. All assessments not certified remain collectible by the contractor or district pursuant to this article. The district shall promptly collect all installments of principal and interest on the assessments so certified. The district shall, thirty days before any installment of principal or interest becomes due, unless the board has provided for collecting the assessments pursuant to section 48-2076, notify by mail every interested person who has filed his name and address with the district, and by publication in not smaller than eighteen point type at least two times in a daily newspaper or at least two successive insertions in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper of general circulation in the district.

B. The notice shall serve for all assessments in the sanitary district due on the date specified in the notice and shall be substantially in the following form:

Notice of special assessments

due on improvements

All persons owning property heretofore assessed for improvements will take notice that an installment of ________________ becomes due and payable on or before the _______ day of ____________________, 19_____, and if not so paid on or before such date the same will become delinquent and a ten per cent penalty will be added to the amount thereof.

C. The board may publish a more detailed notice, in smaller type, but the heading of the notice prescribed in subsection B shall not be printed in smaller type than eighteen point. The first publication of notice shall be at least thirty days before the installment is payable.  The method of publication of notice provided for in this section applies to all bonds and assessments issued and levied and all notices of special assessments due on improvements.

D. When an installment is paid, the district shall note in its records the date of the payment and the name of the person by or for whom it is paid and shall, if requested, give a receipt.

E. On the days following the date on which the installment becomes due, all unpaid installments become delinquent. The district shall certify this fact on its records, mark each installment delinquent and add five per cent to the amount of each installment.

#### Section 48-2069. List of delinquent installments; publication of notice; sale of delinquent property

A. The board, within twenty days from the date of the delinquency, shall begin the publication of the list of the assessments on which any installment is delinquent. The list shall contain a description of each parcel of property and, opposite each description, the name of the owner as stated in the assessment or, if no name is stated in the assessment, the word "unknown" and the amount of the installment delinquent, together with the penalty and costs due, including the cost of advertising.

B. The board shall attach to and publish with the list a notice that unless each delinquent installment, and the penalty and costs on the installment, is paid, the whole amount of the assessment will be declared due and the property on which the assessment is a lien will be sold at public auction at a time and place to be specified in the notice. The publication shall be circulated in the sanitary district for a period of ten days in a daily newspaper, or for two weeks in a weekly newspaper so published and circulated. If published in a daily newspaper, publication shall be made in two issues for the paper, and eight days shall intervene between the first and last publication.

C. Before the date fixed for the sale or before the date to which the sale has been postponed, the district board shall obtain a record search that shows the names and addresses of record of all lien claimants on, and other persons with an interest in, all lots or parcels on which an installment of the assessment is delinquent.  The cost of a record search may be added to the assessment and is deemed to be a portion of the delinquent installment.

D. At least ten days before the sale date or the date to which the sale has been postponed, the district shall cause to be mailed a notice of the date and place of the sale or postponed sale to the owner and to each of the lien claimants and other persons with an interest as shown by the search of records.  The notice shall state the date of the sale, the amount of the delinquent installments including penalties, costs of advertisement and costs of the record search, shall state either that the whole amount of the assessment and costs and penalties or, if the district has provided for the sale of the amount of the delinquent assessment, that the amount then delinquent plus interest, penalties and costs are due at the time of the sale and shall state that, unless redeemed within the time allowed by law, the district's deed will be delivered to the purchaser and the district's deed shall convey title to the lands described therein free and clear of all interests and liens except liens for general property taxes and prior special assessments.

E. A final sale may not be held unless the district has provided notice by mail as prescribed by this section to all lien claimants and others with an interest discovered in the search of records.  The mailing may occur either before the date originally set for the sale or before the date of any postponed sale, and only one mailing and one record search are required.

F. The time of the sale shall not be fewer than five days after the last publication. The place of sale shall be in or in front of the office of the district or in or in front of the usual place of meeting of the board. The sale may be postponed.

#### Section 48-2070. Payment after delinquency and before sale

At any time before the sale of any lot assessed, any person may pay the delinquent installment on the lot together with the penalty and costs due, including the cost of advertising. The board shall note on its records the date of payment, the name of the person by or for whom it is paid and the amount paid.

#### Section 48-2071. Sale procedure; disposition of property by sanitary district

A. On the day fixed for sale, the agent designated by the board shall, at 10:00 a.m., or at any time thereafter to which the sale may be adjourned, begin the sale of the property advertised, beginning at the head of the list and continuing in the numerical order of lots until all are sold. The agent may postpone or continue the sale from day to day until all the property is sold. Each lot separately assessed shall be offered for sale separately. The sale shall be for the entire assessment including the delinquent installments. The person who will take the least quantity of land and immediately pay the amount of the assessment and penalty and costs due, including fifty cents to the district for a certificate of sale, is the purchaser.

B. The district may provide, by resolution, that if there is no purchaser who will pay the entire amount of the assessment and penalty and costs, including fifty cents to the district for a certificate of sale, the agent shall sell the lot or portion of the lot to the person who will take the least quantity of land and immediately pay the amount of the delinquent assessment, including interest, penalty and costs due and fifty cents to the district for a certificate of sale. The agent shall issue a deed to the purchaser, subject to redemption, as provided in this article. The district may also provide by resolution that the lien on the entire lot, piece or parcel of land assessed continues in effect for the amount of the assessment or portion of the assessment, including interest, penalties and costs, thereafter due, and the land may again be sold if the assessment becomes delinquent. If so provided by resolution that fact shall be stated in the notice of sale and the agent shall comply with the provisions.

C. If there is no purchaser for any lot offered for sale and if the district at the time of the issuance and sale of bonds had a permanent population of at least two thousand persons and had been in existence for ten or more years, and if provided for in the resolution calling for the issuance and sale of bonds, it may be struck off to the district as the purchaser, and the governing body may appropriate from the general fund of the treasury the amount bid for such purpose, and may order the treasurer to place the amount in a special fund for such improvement. The governing body, however, may direct the treasurer to pay into the special fund only the sum required to pay the installment then due or to become due on the bonds issued for the assessment, and thereupon the district shall become obligated to pay from the general fund the succeeding installments and interest on the bonds, as are payable by the assessments on the lot. Thereafter the lien of the assessment shall not be extinguished for nonpayment of general taxes or prior special assessments, and the annual installments of principal and interest of the assessment constitute a first lien on the respective lot, piece or parcel of land, coequal with the lien for general taxes. If the lien has not been extinguished before the property being stricken off to this state, the lien shall extinguish on sale of the property pursuant to title 42, chapter 18, article 7 and the district shall share pro rata in the proceeds of the sale to the extent of the delinquent assessments.

D. The district may sell any lot so purchased after the expiration of the time for redemption at public or private sale. All amounts received by the district from redemption of property purchased by it and from sale by it of property so purchased, less the amount theretofore paid into the special fund from the general fund, shall be paid into the special fund for the payment of the bonds until the special fund is sufficient to pay all outstanding bonds. If the district has provided that the installment of principal and interest may be paid in partial payments before the time each of the installments becomes due, and the owner of the property against which the installment of principal and interest has become delinquent has paid into the district partial payments on the installments, the owner of the property advertised for sale has the right to pay the balance due on the annual installments of principal and interest plus penalties and costs, and no sale may be held on the parcel of land.

E. The district shall note on its records the date of the payment and mark the installment of principal or interest paid. If the owner does not pay the balance due on the installment of principal or interest, and the property is sold for the full amount of the assessment, the district shall refund to the owner all money received by it from the owner by way of partial payments.

#### Section 48-2072. Certificate of sale; lien

A. After making the sale, the agent designated by the board shall execute, in duplicate, a certificate of sale stating the description of the property sold, the name of the owner given on the record of the assessment, that the property was sold for a delinquent assessment, the improvement for which the assessment was made, the amount for which the property was sold, the date of sale, the name of the purchaser and the time the purchaser is entitled to a deed. The agent shall file one copy of the certificate in the district office and shall deliver the other to the purchaser.

B. After the copy of the certificate is filed in the office of the district, the lien of the assessment vests in the purchaser and is only divested by a redemption of the property as provided in this article.

C. The agent shall also enter on the record of the assessment, opposite the description of each lot offered for sale, a description of the part sold, the amount for which it was sold, the date of sale and the name of the purchaser.

#### Section 48-2073. Redemption

A. A party having an interest in the lot may redeem the property at any time before the execution and delivery of a deed by paying to the district the amount for which the property was sold and an additional five per cent if paid within three months from the date of sale, ten per cent if paid within six months, twelve per cent if paid within nine months, fifteen per cent if paid within twelve months or twenty per cent if paid after twelve months.

B. When redemption is made, the agent shall note that fact on the duplicate certificate of sale in his office and deposit the amount paid with the treasurer. The treasurer shall credit the purchaser named in the certificate of sale with the amount and pay the amount to the purchaser or his assignee on the surrender of the certificate of sale.

#### Section 48-2074. Deed to purchaser; notice to owner; redemption after notice; effect of deed

A. After the expiration of twelve months from the date of sale, the board shall cause to be executed to the purchaser or his assignee on his application, if he has fully complied with this section, a deed to the property sold.  The deed shall recite substantially the matters contained in the certificate, any assignment and that no person has redeemed the property. The district shall receive from the applicant for a deed one dollar for making the deed.

B. The purchaser shall, at least thirty days before he applies for a deed, mail to the owner, all lien claimants of record, all persons of record with an interest in the property and, if occupied, the occupant of the property a written notice that the property, as described, has been sold for a delinquent assessment, the improvement for which the assessment was made, the amount for which the property was sold, the amount necessary to redeem at the time of giving notice, the time the purchaser or assignee may apply to the district for a deed and that all interests in the property, whether of record before or after recording of the assessment lien in the district office, will be extinguished, except for the lien for general property taxes and prior special assessments. If the owner cannot be found after due diligence, the notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place on the property at least thirty days before the time stated in the notice for the application for a deed.

C. The applicant shall file with the district an affidavit showing that notice of the application has been given and, if the notice was not served on the owner personally, that due diligence was used to find the owner. If redemption of the property is made after the affidavit is filed and more than eleven months from the date of sale, the person making redemption shall pay, in addition, for payment to the purchaser, fifteen dollars for the service of notice and the making of the affidavit.

D. The deed of the district is prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters stated in the deed, the regularity of all proceedings before the execution of the deed and of title in the grantee. The deed shall convey to the purchaser fee title to the lands described therein, free and clear of all interests, liens, claims and encumbrances whether of record before or after the assessment lien, except for the lien for general property taxes and prior special assessments.

#### Section 48-2075. Disposition of sale proceeds

The agent designated by the board shall promptly pay to the treasurer all monies collected by him from sales. The treasurer, on receipt of the monies, shall place the monies in the special fund created for the payments of the bonds issued for the improvement.

#### Section 48-2076. Resolution for collection of assessments by taxation

A. The board may by resolution passed before or after issuance of the bonds provide that the assessments for the payment of the bonds are collectible in the manner and by the officers provided by law for the collection and enforcement of the general taxes levied by the district. The resolution shall be general in terms and shall apply to assessments for all improvement bonds issued whether issued before or after passage of the resolution.

B. The time for payment of the respective installments of principal and interest under the resolution shall be the last regular date for the payment of general taxes of the district before the date at which the installments of principal and interest become delinquent. The delinquency, the penalties incurred for delinquency and the method of collection under the resolution are the same as for general taxes of the district.

C. The board adopting such method of collection may, at any time, repeal the resolution providing for the method and, on repeal, the provisions for collection of assessments provided in this article become effective.

D. If any installment of an assessment is not collected when due, it may be added to and collected with any succeeding installment.

E. The provisions of section 35-481, regarding summary sale of property, may be exercised to collect any delinquent annual assessment installment.

#### Section 48-2077. Procedure if assessment declared void

A. If the assessment on a lot levied for an improvement under this article, or part of an improvement, or the entire assessment, is adjudged void for any reason, the board shall cause to be levied and assessed on the lot on which the assessment has been held void, or on all the lots included within the limits assessed for the work, a new assessment sufficient to provide for the payment of principal and interest on all bonds then unpaid. The reassessment shall be made as nearly as practicable in the same manner and with the same effect as the original assessment.

B. In case of partial deficit the board may pay the deficit from the general fund.

#### Section 48-2078. Failure to hold or adjourn scheduled hearing; provision for subsequent hearing

If the time and place for a hearing are fixed by the board under this article, and for any reason the hearing is not held or regularly adjourned to a specified time and place, the authority of the board is not divested or lost. The board may thereafter fix a time and place for the hearing and cause notice to be given by publication by at least one insertion in a newspaper of general circulation in the district as designated by the board. The publication shall be at least five days before the date of the hearing.

#### Section 48-2079. Proof of publication and posting

Unless otherwise provided, proof of publication or of posting resolutions or notices shall be made by the affidavit of the person required to make publication or do the posting. The affidavit shall state the manner of publication or posting and the dates, shall have attached a copy of the publication or notice posted and shall be filed in the district office.

#### Section 48-2080. Public records; duties of engineer

A. The district shall keep the records required by this article at the district office. The records shall be open to inspection during office hours.

B. The engineer shall do the surveying and all other engineering work necessary under this article. Every certificate signed by the engineer in his official capacity is prima facie evidence of the truth of its contents. The engineer shall keep a record of all surveys made by him. In districts where there is no engineer, the board may appoint a suitable person to discharge such duties and fix his compensation.

#### Section 48-2081. Bond anticipation notes; form; procedures applicable

A. If the board determines and states in the resolution of intention that improvement bonds shall be issued, bond anticipation notes may be sold at any time after the award of a construction contract, except that bond anticipation notes to pay the estimated engineering fees may be issued at any time after the adoption of the resolution ordering the improvement.

B. Bond anticipation notes shall be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of improvement bonds and monies collected from property owners who want to pay all or part of their assessments in cash before the filing of the certified list of unpaid assessments as provided in section 48-2065, or for bond anticipation notes issued to pay estimated engineering fees, from the proceeds of the sale of improvement bonds or from a tax levy imposed by the district pursuant to section 48-2056, subsection B.  The notes may be in such form and denomination as the board provides. The notes shall be executed by the chairman of the board and attested by the secretary. The notes may bear interest from their date at a rate not in excess of the maximum rate shown in the resolution of intention. The term of the notes shall not be more than six months beyond the date set for completion of the construction. The board may repay such notes before maturity and without penalty or extend the life of the notes if the term of the construction contract is extended or if any default is made by the contractor. The notes shall be authorized by resolution of the board.

C. The total amount of notes issued for any improvement shall not be greater than the aggregate of ninety per cent of the contract price and the total estimated amount of incidental expenses. The notes shall be sold at not less than par at either public or private sale. If authorized by the board, the chairman may enter into loan agreements with the purchaser of the notes relative to:

1. The time and place of delivery.

2. The sale of improvement bonds to the purchaser of the notes if the district is unable to procure a purchaser willing to purchase the bonds when issued.

3. Making the demand on the owners of property for payment in cash.

4. Collection of cash payments from persons who want to pay their assessments in cash and application of such cash payments to the repayment of the notes.

5. Payment of an additional fee to the purchaser of the note to cover the administrative expenses of the cash collections if the purchaser is the person to whom cash collections are made.

D. To secure the payment of the notes the loan agreements may also provide for a collateral assignment to the purchaser of the notes of all cash collections, the warrant and the district's interest in the performance bond.

E. The proceeds from the sale of the notes shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the treasurer and used for payment of incidental expenses and payments to the construction contractor.

F. Proceeds from the sale of the notes shall be used to make semimonthly or monthly payments to the contractor on a basis of ninety per cent of the value of the work actually performed, as estimated by the engineer employed for such purpose, up to and including the fifteenth or last day of each calendar month. The balance shall be paid to the contractor after the sale of the bonds solely from the proceeds from the bond sale, or if bonds equal to the balance remaining cannot be sold, the balance shall be paid by delivery of a similar principal amount of bonds to the contractor.

G. The issuance of bond anticipation notes constitutes an assignment to the district of the monies due the contractor under the construction contract. The district may agree with the contractor that the district will make the demands for cash payments as provided in section 48-2058 or may authorize the purchaser of the bond anticipation notes to make the cash collections.

H. If bonds are issued to represent any assessments remaining unpaid on the date the list is certified, the district shall sell the bonds and use the proceeds to redeem the notes and pay the balance due to the contractor.

I. In addition to any incidental expenses included in the assessment, if bond anticipation notes are issued, the notes may also include in the incidental expenses all interest accruing on the bond anticipation notes, the added costs of cash collections, if any, and all legal or financial fees incurred in the issuance and sale of the bond anticipation notes.

J. If bond anticipation notes have been issued and the contractor has been paid in accordance with subsection F of this section, the district shall apply the proceeds collected from demands on the property owners to the reduction of the outstanding portion of the bond anticipation notes and, if the notes have been paid, to the contractor to reduce any balance due him.

 

#### Section 48-2082. Revolving fund; lapsing provisions; separate fund

A. The board may establish a revolving fund to aid the construction of public improvements under this chapter. The board may provide for transfers into such fund from any lawful source.

B. All unexpended balances of appropriations from the fund remaining after the appropriations lapse revert to the fund.

C. The fund established pursuant to this section shall be kept separate and apart from all other funds.

D. The monies in the revolving fund may be used to purchase bond anticipation notes, aid in the payments made to the construction contractor, provide for the payment of the district's share of any improvement authorized under this article or provide monies to pay the assessments levied against public property.

#### Section 48-2083. Deficiency in collections

If there is a deficiency in the revenues collected from the special assessments by reason of the inadequacy of the method of collection adopted by the district under section 48-2076, and the district had a population of more than two thousand persons and had been in existence for ten or more years, at the time the bonds were issued and sold, and the resolution authorizing the issuance and sale of the bonds particularly specifies, the district may make good the deficiency, reimbursing itself from the monies collected from the installments when they are received. If that method has not been adopted, the district may, but is not obligated to, make good the deficiency by a temporary loan from some other fund.

#### Section 48-2084. Improvement districts for enhanced sanitation services

A. In addition to the purposes for which an improvement district may be formed under section 48-2043, an improvement district may be formed within a designated area to provide public sanitation service within the district at a higher level or greater degree than provided in the remainder of the community.

B. The powers and duties of the governing body of the district and the procedure to be followed shall be as provided in this article for other types of special improvement districts.

C. The governing body of a sanitary district, if it finds that enhanced services are required or are being received by any portion of the territory included in the district, may adopt, after making such finding of fact, a resolution of intention to order the improvement pursuant to the provisions of section 48-2044.

D. The engineer shall make duplicate diagrams of the property contained in the improvement district. The diagram shall show each separate lot numbered consecutively and the area in square feet of each lot or parcel. Before making any assessment on the district, the diagram shall be approved by the governing body.

E. The governing body shall make annual statements and estimates of the expenses of the district and shall assess the total amount on the several lots, each respectively in proportion to the benefits to be received by each lot. When the assessments have been completed, the governing body shall fix a time when it will hear and pass on the assessments and the prior related proceedings which shall not be less than twenty days after the date of the notice. Notice of hearing shall be given in the manner provided by section 48-2058, subsection E. Any person who owns real property affected by the assessment and who has any objection to the legality of the assessment, or to any of the previous related proceedings, may file, before the time fixed for the hearing, a written notice briefly specifying the grounds of the objection. At the time fixed for the hearing or at any time not later than ten days thereafter to which the hearing may be postponed, the governing body shall hear and pass on the objections. The decision of the governing body is final and conclusive on all persons entitled to object as to all errors, informalities and irregularities which the governing body might have remedied or avoided any time during the progress of the proceedings.

F. The assessments for the annual expenses are collectible in the manner and by the officers provided by law for the collection and enforcement of general taxes the district is authorized to levy. All statutes providing for the levy and collection of county and sanitary district taxes, including the collection of delinquent taxes and sale of property for nonpayment of taxes, apply to the district assessments provided for under this section.

G. An improvement district formed under this section is not authorized to issue improvement bonds.

H. No improvement district formed under this section is authorized to engage in any activity other than as provided in subsection A of this section.

I. The formation of an improvement district under this section does not prevent the subsequent establishment of improvement districts for any other purpose authorized by law.

J. If, in the opinion of the governing body, any territory of a district formed under this section is not benefited by being a part of the district, the governing body, by resolution, may exempt such territory from assessment under this section, or if any portion of the territory of a district formed under this section is no longer benefited by being a part of the district, the governing body, by resolution, may summarily delete from the district formed under this section any such area and may form a new district from the balance of the original district formed under this section.

K. Any real property within the boundaries of the district utilized for residential purposes which is not specifically benefited by the public services at a higher level or greater degree is exempt from assessment pursuant to this section for that year. Existing improved real property utilized for residential purposes with four units or less per building at the time of formation of the district is presumed to not be specifically benefited by a public service at a higher level or greater degree.

L. An owner of property subjected to an assessment pursuant to this section shall not transfer the assessment to or otherwise impose the assessment on a lessee of the property without the express written consent of the lessee.

#### Section 48-2085. Reallocation of assessments in the event of land exchange for public property

If a parcel of property that is subject to assessment and a lien under section 48-2057, subsection H is exchanged to this state or the United States for another parcel of property in the sanitary district owned by this state or the United States and the parcel of new private property receives substantially the same benefit from the improvement constructed as the parcel exchanged to this state or the United States, the assessment lien imposed on the original parcel of property may be transferred to and imposed on the parcel of new private property if the owners of that parcel agree to the reallocation of the assessment in writing and it is filed with the district.

### Article 3 - Refunding Bonds

#### Section 48-2091. Refunding bonds

A. The board of directors of a sanitary district may issue bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds issued pursuant to article 2 of this chapter. Refunding bonds may be issued only if the total amount of principal of and interest on the refunding bonds does not exceed the total amount of remaining principal of and interest on the bonds to be refunded.

B. Refunding bonds shall be issued and sold and contain such details as the board of directors prescribes.

C. Interest on refunding bonds is payable on January 1 and July 1 each year.

D. The due dates of refunding bonds are January 1 and July 1 in the years they are due.

 

#### Section 48-2091.01. Use of net proceeds of refunding bonds; authorized investments

A. Refunding bonds issued under this article may be:

1. Exchanged for bonds of at least the same principal amount of the bonds to be refunded.

2. Sold at, above or below par at a negotiated or public sale.

3. Exchanged in part and sold in part.

B. If the refunding bonds are sold, the net proceeds of the refunding bonds, together with all or part of the amounts held in the debt service fund for payment of principal of and interest on the bonds being refunded, amounts in any reserve fund for the bonds being refunded and other amounts lawfully available, may be invested if the investments and any reinvestment will mature with interest so as to provide monies to pay the bonds to be refunded when due, or when called for redemption, plus interest and redemption premiums, if any, at maturity or on an available redemption date or on an earlier voluntary surrender with the consent of the board of directors. On receipt, these amounts and investments shall be deposited in trust with a national banking corporation, or an association authorized to do trust business in this state, that is a member of the federal deposit insurance corporation, or any successor. After the deposit, the bonds being refunded are considered to have been paid and have no further interest in the assessments for the bonds being refunded. For the purposes of this subsection, "net proceeds" means the gross proceeds of the refunding bonds, after the deduction of:

1. All accrued interest.

2. Costs and expenses incurred:

(a) In connection with the authorization and issuance of the refunding bonds.

(b) In connection with the refunding of the bonds being refunded.

(c) Resulting from price variation to par.

(d) In the purchase of obligations for the trust.

(e) In the distribution of the refunding bonds.

C. The treasurer of the sanitary district may enter into trust agreements with banking corporations or associations for the handling, safekeeping and administration of the amounts and investments that are derived from, or contributed to, the refunding.

1. Obligations issued by the United States government or one of its agencies.

2. Obligations fully guaranteed by the United States government as to principal and interest.

 

#### Section 48-2091.02. Modified assessment; notice and hearing

A. If refunding bonds are issued, the board of directors shall file a modified assessment reflecting the reduction in the assessment.

B. If the modified assessment does not increase the assessment on any parcel or lot in the sanitary district, the board may approve the modified assessment without notice or hearing. If the modification results in an increase in the assessment to any parcel or lot in the district, notice and, if required, a hearing must be provided in the manner prescribed by section 48-2062.

 

#### Section 48-2091.03. Security for and payment of bonds; special fund

A. Refunding bonds shall be secured by and are payable from the special assessments levied to pay the bonds being refunded. On the issuance of refunding bonds, the board of directors shall cause the remaining unpaid installments of the special assessments to be recalculated and modified so that the amounts to be collected equal the amounts necessary to repay the refunding bonds.

B. Section 48-2062 does not apply to the recalculation and modification of the assessments authorized by this subsection.  All other provisions of article 2 of this chapter regarding the collection, payment and enforcement of the assessments of the bonds being refunded and the validity and priority of the lien of the assessments for the bonds being refunded continue in force and effect. Except as provided by this article, the assessments survive the payment or defeasance of the bonds being refunded and remain in force and effect, securing the refunding bonds until they are paid in full.  The special assessments are the same first liens on the property that was assessed for the bonds being refunded, subject only to the lien for general property taxes and prior special assessments.  The full faith and diligence of the district are irrevocably pledged for the assessment or reassessment, collection and payment of the special assessments.

C. Refunding bonds are payable only from a special fund to be established and collected from the special assessments.  The fund is set apart solely to pay the principal of and interest on refunding bonds and for no other purpose. All monies collected from the special assessment shall be deposited in the special fund.

#### Section 48-2091.04. Collection of assessments

The treasurer of the sanitary district and the county treasurer may provide by agreement for:

1. The county treasurer to collect the special assessments under this article at the same time and in the same manner as provided by law for the collection and enforcement of general ad valorem property taxes.

2. The payment of the county treasurer's collection expenses directly related to the special assessment and, if so provided, the levy of the special assessment may include an amount for compensation of the county treasurer directly related to the collection of the special assessment. The compensation received by the county treasurer pursuant to the agreement is governed by section 11-496.

 

#### Section 48-2091.05. Determination of board of directors

The determination by the board of directors that the limitations and conditions prescribed by this article relating to issuing refunding bonds have been met is conclusive in the absence of fraud or arbitrary and gross abuse of discretion.

The board of directors shall, on or before the first meeting of the board of supervisors in July each year, furnish the board of supervisors and the assessor of the county in which the district is located, or if the district is not entirely within the county, then as otherwise provided by this article, to the board of supervisors and assessor of each county in which any portion of the district is located, an estimate in writing of the amount of money needed for the purposes of the district for the ensuing fiscal year.

B. The amount shall be sufficient to raise the annual interest on the outstanding bonds, to pay the estimated cost of repair, the incidental expenses of the district, and in any year in which any bonds fall due, an amount sufficient to pay the principal of the outstanding bonds as they mature.

C. If the revenues of the district are sufficient to discharge such obligations without the levy of a tax, the district shall certify that fact to the board of supervisors, and the filing of the budget shall not be required.

#### Section 48-2412. Proportionate division of estimate if district lies in more than one county

If a district is located in more than one county, the total estimate as provided for in section 48-2411 shall be divided by the board of directors in proportion to the value of the real property included within the district in each county. This value shall be determined from the equalized values of the last assessment rolls of such counties. When the division of the estimate has been made the board shall furnish to the boards of supervisors and county assessors of the respective counties a written statement of that part of the estimate apportioned to that county.

#### Section 48-2413. Failure of district to provide estimate

#### Section 48-2414. Computation of tax rate; levy

A. The board of supervisors of each county in which a district or any part thereof is located shall annually, at the time of levying county taxes, levy a tax to be known as "(name of district) agricultural improvement district tax" sufficient to raise the amount reported to the board in the estimate. The board of supervisors shall determine the rate of tax by dividing the total amount required to be raised, plus fifteen per cent for anticipated delinquencies, by the total number of acres included within the district.

B. The board of supervisors shall levy against each landowner in the district a tax equal to the unit rate multiplied by the number of acres owned, and certified by the board of directors of the district to the board of supervisors. The board of directors, in certifying the annual estimate to the board of supervisors, shall include a list of landowners in the district and the number of acres owned by each.

#### Section 48-2415. Entry of tax on roll; collection

B. The tax shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as general county property taxes, and when collected shall be paid into the county treasury for the use of the district. The taxes imposed by this section shall be a lien upon the lands against which they are levied until paid, and shall be subject to the same penalties and interest upon delinquent amounts as are general county property taxes.

C. The board of directors shall not provide irrigation, drainage, power or any other service to lands upon which a district tax is delinquent until the whole thereof with interest and penalties is paid.

#### Section 48-2416. Applicability of state tax laws; duty of county officers

County officers shall be liable upon their official bonds for the faithful discharge of the duties imposed upon them by this chapter.

#### Section 48-2417. Payment of district taxes without paying other taxes

A. When a parcel of land located in an agricultural improvement district is assessed for district taxes, the tax or any installment thereof may be paid separately and without at the same time paying other property taxes assessed and levied against the same property. The county treasurer shall receive payments of the tax and deliver to the person paying the tax a receipt therefor showing the name of the district, a description of sufficient certainty to identify the property assessed for the tax, the total amount of tax, the amount paid and the name of the person paying the tax.

B. This section shall not be construed to permit the payment of any other tax without at the same time paying the district taxes assessed against the same property.

#### Section 48-2418. Transmittal to district treasurer of monies collected by county treasurer

The treasurer of each county in which an agricultural improvement district is wholly or in part located shall, on or before the fifteenth day of each month, pay to the treasurer of the district all monies of the district collected during the preceding month, and shall take the receipt of the treasurer of the district therefor, which shall constitute his discharge from any further liability for the monies or the application of the monies.

#### Section 48-2420. Payment of interest coupons; redemption of unmatured bonds

A. Upon presentation of matured interest coupons to the district treasurer, he shall pay them from the bond fund.

B. When the bond fund amounts to ten thousand dollars in excess of the amount sufficient to meet the matured interest coupons, the board of directors shall direct the district treasurer to pay such an amount of unmatured bonds of the district as the money in the bond fund will redeem, at the lowest value at which they are offered for liquidation, after advertising in the manner provided by section 48-2444 for sealed bids for the redemption of such bonds. The bids shall be opened by the board in open meeting at the time specified in the notice, and the lowest bid for the bonds shall be accepted, but no bond shall be redeemed at a rate above par. If the bids are equal, the lowest numbered bond shall have preference.

C. If none of the holders of such bonds desires to have them redeemed, the money shall be invested by the treasurer under direction of the board of directors in bonds of the United States or of the state. Such bonds shall be kept in the bond fund and may be used to redeem district bonds when the holders thereof so request, either by exchanging them for bonds of the district or by converting them into cash and redeeming the bonds of the district.

#### Section 48-2422. Payment of warrants; reports of district treasurer

A. The district treasurer shall disburse the money received from the county treasurer only upon warrants of the board of directors signed by the president and attested by the secretary.

E. Within twenty days after the date of the first publication, if no objections have been filed, the successful bidder shall enter into a contract to make the improvement according to its bid.  If objections are filed but are rejected by the board, the contract shall be entered into within five days after receiving notice from the board of that rejection.  If the bidder fails to enter into the contract within that period, the board, without further proceedings, shall advertise for proposals in the same manner as for the initial proposals.  A bidder who fails to enter into the contract is liable on the bidder's bond accompanying the proposal for all costs and damages incurred and sustained by reason of the failure to enter into the contract.

F. If the board determines that contracting services for construction of the flood protection facility should be procured pursuant to title 34, chapter 6, article 1, before executing the contract pursuant to section  34-609, the board shall formally approve the form of contract and award the contract to the selected person or firm on a motion, noted in its minutes and approved by a majority vote of its members.

G. Notice of the award of the contract shall be published twice in a daily newspaper or once in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper of general circulation in the county.  The notice of award shall specifically state the type of contract and that the contract was procured pursuant to title 34, chapter 6, article 1 without competitive bidding.

H. At any time within fifteen days after the date of the first publication, any person or entity that participated in the procurement process that selected the person or entity to whom such contract was awarded, or a person having an interest in a lot, acre or parcel liable for an assessment who claims that any of the previous acts or proceedings relating to the improvement or the procurement of contracting services are irregular, illegal or faulty, may file with the board a written notice specifying in what respect the acts and proceedings are irregular, illegal or faulty.  All objections to any act or proceeding that are not made before the notice of the award are deemed to be waived, except as to matters directly affecting the authority of the board.  If the board finds any objection to be valid, it may abandon the proceedings, correct or modify any portion of the proceedings or proceed as in the first instance.

I. Within twenty days after the date of the first publication, if no objections have been filed, the person or entity to whom contracting services have been awarded shall enter into a contract to construct the flood protection facility according to its proposal.  If objections are filed but are rejected by the board, the contract shall be entered into within five days after receiving notice from the board of the rejection.  If the person or entity to whom contracting services have been awarded fails to enter into the contract within that period, the board without further proceedings shall either advertise for proposals, negotiate a contract with one of the other persons or entities that participated in the procurement process or reinitiate the process for procurement of contracting services pursuant to title 34, chapter 6, article 1.  The person or entity that failed to enter into the contract is liable for all costs and damages incurred and sustained by reason of that failure.

 

#### Section 48-2842. Form and execution of contract; supervision of performance; surety

A. The district shall make all written contracts and receive all bonds authorized by this article. The contracts shall specify a reasonable time for completing the flood protection facility.

B. The board may prescribe a form for the contract that is not inconsistent with this article or with title 34, chapter 6, article 1, if that procurement method is chosen, and fix a reasonable time for completing the work, which may be extended by the board.

C. The work shall be done under the direction of the board or its engineer. The board may prescribe administrative rules relating to supervising the work. The board may appoint its engineer or a suitable person to take charge of and direct the construction of a flood protection facility on behalf of the district.  The person appointed is responsible for supervising fulfillment of the contract. The board shall fix the compensation for that person.

D. If the work is not performed with diligence, the board, after a hearing and service of notice on the contractor and the contractor's surety, may prescribe those terms and conditions as it deems proper before allowing the contractor to continue with the work.

E. If the board finds that the contractor is unable to continue with the work or to perform the work according to the contract, the board shall hold the contractor in default and make demand on the surety to act according to the contract and the terms and conditions of the performance bond.  If the surety fails to act within sixty days after the date of the written notice, the board may order that proposals be received from other contractors to complete the work.  After receiving proposals, the board may award the contract to the lowest responsible bidder.  If, after receiving the new proposals, the cost of completion exceeds the monies or bonds available for payment, the board shall make a demand on the defaulting contractor's surety for payment of the difference within twenty days after the mailing of the notice.  If the surety is represented by an attorney-in-fact, the demand may be served on the attorney-in-fact or at the surety's principal office in this state.  If the surety has no attorney-in-fact and no principal office in this state, the demand shall be served on the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions.  The demand may not exceed the penal sum of the performance bond.  Monies collected from the surety shall be used to pay any added costs of completing the work.  Any difference between the actual costs of the work and the amount assessed shall be advanced by the district, which shall use its contingency fund or any other available monies to pay the new contractor.  The district shall reimburse itself from the amounts paid by the former contractor or its surety or from assessments and bonds when monies become available.  All additional costs of the work not received from the original contractor's surety shall ultimately be assessed against the benefiting parcels of property.

#### Section 48-2843. Bonds required from contractor

Before executing the contract, the contractor shall file with the district a performance bond in the form prescribed in section 34-222 and a payment bond in the form prescribed in section 34-223.

 

#### Section 48-2844. Diagrams of property affected; estimate of benefits; assessment; warrant

A. The engineer shall make duplicate diagrams of the property in the assessment district.  The diagrams shall show each separate lot, acre or parcel of land in the assessment district, numbered consecutively, and the location of the lot, acre or parcel in relation to the work proposed to be done.

B. After the board has approved, certified and dated the diagrams, they shall be filed in the office of the flood protection district.

C. At any time after a contract has been executed for construction of the flood protection facility, the district shall estimate or cause to be estimated on the lots, acres or parcels in the assessment district the benefits arising or expected to arise from the work.  The district shall then make an assessment to cover the amount due for the work performed and specified in the contract for construction of the flood protection facility, including incidental expenses, and shall assess against the lots, acres and parcels the total amount of the costs and expenses of the work.  In so doing the district shall assess the total amount on the several lots, acres or parcels, each respectively in proportion to the respective benefits to be received.

D. The assessment shall cover the amount due for the work performed as specified in the contract and shall include incidental expenses.  The incidental expenses shall include the compensation of the district engineer for its work, the cost of printing, advertising and posting, the compensation of the person appointed by the district to take charge of and direct the construction of the improvement on behalf of the flood protection district, the expenses of making the assessment, the interest on the bonds for a period not longer than the expected period of construction and one year beyond, all costs incurred by the district with respect to the flood protection facility, or the proceedings leading to the assessment that must be repaid to the county and all legal and financial fees, expenses and costs incurred in drafting the proceedings and in the sale of the bonds, including any initial issue discount on the bonds. The amount of incidental expenses shall be settled and allowed by the board, or the district's representative specifically appointed by the board for such purpose, on presentation of itemized bills.

E. The assessment shall briefly refer to the contract and shall name the contractor and the contractor's surety, the amount to be paid pursuant to the contract and all incidental expenses, the amount of each assessment, the name of the owner of each lot, acre or parcel, if known, and if unknown the word "unknown" shall be written opposite the number of the assessment, together with the amount assessed on the lot, acre or parcel.  The district shall list the names of owners as shown on the most recent certified county assessment roll and any other person of whom the district has personal knowledge that may be the owner of the respective lot, acre or parcel.  The assessments on the lots, acres or parcels shall be consecutively numbered, and the diagram shall be numbered to correspond with the assessment numbers.

F. A warrant shall be attached to the assessment signed by the chairperson or president of the board, which shall be substantially in the following form:

I (name of chairperson or president of board of directors), of the (name of flood protection district and county), state of Arizona, by virtue of the authority vested in me as chairperson or president, authorize and empower (name of person nominated by the board to collect the several assessments by making cash demands on the owners), or his or her agents, to demand and receive the several assessments on the assessment attached, and this shall be his or her warrant for the same.

G. The warrant and assessment shall be recorded in the district's office and one diagram shall be filed not earlier than the date of execution of the contract.  When recorded, the several amounts assessed are a first lien on the lots, acres or parcels assessed subject only to the lien for general property taxes, but coequal with prior special assessments, for a period beginning on the date of recording and terminating on the date the assessment against the respective lot, acre or parcel is paid in full.  The recording constitutes notice to all persons interested in the contents of the record.  The board also may order that notice of the recording of the assessment in the office of the district be recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the flood protection district is located.  If notice is recorded in the office of the county recorder, it shall be sufficient to state the boundaries of the assessment district or attach a map showing the boundaries and refer to the actual recording of the warrant and assessment at the district's office.  Failure to file such a notice with the county recorder shall not invalidate either the assessment or the warrant and shall not diminish in any manner the scope of the notice afforded by recording the warrant and assessment in the district office.

 

#### Section 48-2845. Delivery of warrant and assessment to contractor; demand for payment; release of assessments; review of assessment

A. After the warrant and assessment are recorded pursuant to section 48-2844, they shall be delivered to the person charged by the board with the duty of making demands for the payment, together with one of the diagrams.  By virtue of the warrant, that person may demand and receive the amount of the several assessments.

B. The person charged by the board shall call on the person assessed, either in person or by mail if the person can conveniently be found, and demand payment, and if paid the person nominated by the board shall provide a receipt.  The receipt, when presented to the district, constitutes an order to it to release the assessment.  A copy of the receipt shall be kept on file at the district office.

C. The person nominated by the board shall promptly notify the district of all payments received, and the district shall release all assessments that have been fully paid.  If the name of the owner of the lot, acre or parcel is stated on the assessment as "unknown", the person nominated by the board shall demand payment of a person in possession of the lot, acre or parcel.  If someone is in possession, the demand may be made either by mail, if a mailing address for the person in possession can be determined, or in person.  If the premises are unoccupied or the person in possession cannot be found, the demand is unnecessary.

D. The warrant shall be returned to the board within thirty days after its date endorsed with "return", signed by the person nominated by the board, verified on oath and stating the nature and character of the demand, whether any assessments remain wholly or partially unpaid and the amount of any unpaid assessments. In the absence of fraud or bad faith, the verified statement of the person making the return is conclusive proof that the demand for payment was made on each owner or each person in possession of each lot, acre or parcel of property as required by this section.  The board shall record the return in the margin of the record of the warrant and assessment. After return of the assessment and warrant, all amounts remaining due shall draw interest at the maximum rate specified in the resolution of intention until paid or, on the issuance of bonds, at the rate specified in the bonds payable for the semiannual periods specified in the bonds, notwithstanding that the installments of assessments may be due at dates earlier than the dates installments of principal or interest are payable on the bonds.

E. On recording the assessment and warrant, the board shall fix a time when it will hear and consider the assessment and the proceedings taken, which shall be at least twenty days after the date of the recording.  The board shall publish notice of the hearing for five days in a daily newspaper or two times in a weekly or semiweekly newspaper of general circulation in the flood protection district.  The board shall send notices of the time and place of the hearing by first class mail at least twenty days before the hearing date to the contractor at the address shown in the contract, and to all persons owning real property affected by the assessments as their names and addresses appear on the last certified property tax roll.  On request of the district, the county assessor shall provide the names and addresses as shown on the last certified tax roll.  If no address appears for a person on the last certified tax roll, no notice need be mailed to that person.  The chairperson of the board shall make an affidavit of the mailing and shall state that the persons to whom notices were mailed constitute all persons whose names and addresses appear on the tax roll as owning property in the area assessed or the assessment district, as applicable.  The affidavit is conclusive proof that notice was mailed to each person to whom notice is required to be mailed.  The failure to receive notice does not constitute any jurisdictional defect invalidating a district proceeding or assessment if notice has been given pursuant to this subsection.

F. Before the time fixed for the hearing, any owner, contractor or other person directly interested in the work or in the assessment who has any objection to the amount or legality of the assessment or to any of the previous proceedings, or who claims that the work has not been performed according to the contract, may file a written notice briefly specifying the grounds of the objection.  At the time fixed for the hearing or at any time within ten days after the original hearing date, during which the hearing may be postponed, the board shall hear and consider all such objections.  The decision of the board is final and conclusive on all persons entitled to object as to all errors, informalities and irregularities that the board may have remedied or avoided at any time during the proceedings.

G. After the hearing, if the board of directors finds that the assessment has not yet been fairly apportioned, it shall modify the amounts of the several assessments and may order that the assessment be recomputed if it finds that the benefits to any lots, acres or parcels do not equal the amount assessed against the lot, acre or parcel.  When recomputing the assessment, the board shall levy the reassessments according to the benefits derived, notwithstanding that the reduction of any assessment may cause a corresponding increase in other assessments.

H. At any time within one year after the date the district files the certificate of substantial completion as provided in section 48-2851, subsection G, any member of the board of directors, any owner or any person claiming an interest in any assessed lot, acre or parcel may file a written notice with the clerk stating that the work has not been performed substantially according to the resolution of intention or the plans, specifications and contract for construction of the flood protection facility. The notice shall state in particular the contractor's failure to perform and may also state, if applicable, any requested reduction in the assessment of any one or more parcels due solely to the failure of such performance.  The notice shall state the name and address of the person filing the notice and shall describe the person's interest in land subject to assessment, if applicable.

I. On receipt of a notice pursuant to subsection H of this section, the board of directors shall set a date for a hearing on the notice.  The board of directors shall give notice of the hearing to the contractor, the contractor's surety, the person appointed to take charge of and direct the work and all persons whose names and addresses appear in the notice.  The clerk shall publish a notice of the hearing twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.

J. At the hearing, the board shall determine whether the work was completed according to the resolution of intention, the plans, specifications and contract for construction of the flood protection facility and any corrections or alterations of the plans deemed necessary.  If the board determines that the work has not been so completed, it shall order the contractor to complete the work, set a reasonable time for completion and recess the hearing until the date set for completion.  If, at the date set to reconvene the hearing, the evidence shows that the work is then completed, the board shall enter those findings on its minutes.  If the board determines that the contractor is making a good faith attempt to complete the work, it may continue the completion date and recess the hearing to a later date.  If, at the hearing or at any recessed hearing, the board of directors finds that the contractor refuses to complete or is incapable of completing the work, the board shall order and the district's attorney shall bring an action against the contractor and its surety to collect such amounts or cause such performance as is necessary to complete the work.

K. If the board determines that for any reason the work cannot be completed and no recovery can be made against the contractor or the contractor's surety, the board may recompute the assessment, taking into consideration the effect the contractor's failure to perform may have had on the actual benefits derived from the improvement, and reduce some or all assessments to reflect the reduced benefits.  If the assessments are reduced, the district shall assume as a contingent liability any difference between the amounts thereafter received on the semiannual assessment payments and the amounts of principal and interest thereafter due on the bonds.  The assumption of that amount shall be a contingent general obligation of the district.

L. All decisions made concerning any notice filed pursuant to this section are final and conclusive as to the persons filing the notice, the contractor and the contractor's surety and as to the alleged defect, or defects, in the work.  After a ruling on any alleged defect, or defects, in the work, the board shall not consider or hear a later notice concerning the same defect, whether or not filed by a person other than the person filing the original notice.

M. After the work is completed, the district shall file a recomputed assessment based on the actual quantities determined by the engineer to have been constructed or installed, or the actual cost of the acquisition, together with the known incidental expenses paid to that date and the itemized estimated incidental expenses remaining to be paid.  The engineer need not recompute each individual assessment but shall determine the amount of the increase or decrease to be assessed and shall file a supplemental statement with the clerk stating the ratio of the difference between the contractor's bid and the recapitulated amount and ordering that each assessment be increased or decreased by that ratio.  If the total assessment is decreased, the treasurer shall credit the amount of the decrease proportionately on the assessments remaining unpaid and return to the owner, if the owner can be located, that portion of each assessment previously paid in cash that represents an excess payment.

 

#### Section 48-2846. Action against property owner to collect assessment

A. If the owner of a lot, acre or parcel of property that received an assessment files a request that no bonds be issued against the owner's lot, acre or parcel, at any time after thirty-five days from the date of the warrant, the district may sue the owner of the lot, acre or parcel assessed and recover the amount of an assessment remaining unpaid with interest at the maximum rate specified in the resolution of intention until paid or foreclose the lien of the assessment.

B. If personal demand has been made and the owner has refused to pay the assessment so demanded, the district may recover reasonable attorney fees.

C. Only one action shall be brought to foreclose liens arising under a single proceeding against the same defendant.

D. The warrant, assessment and diagram, with the affidavit of demand and nonpayment, are prima facie evidence of the regularity and correctness of the assessment and of the prior proceedings and acts of the board on which the warrant, assessment and diagram are based and are also evidence of the right of the district to recover.

#### Section 48-2847. Invalidity of liens or bonds; extent of validity; means to secure interest of persons damaged

A. If the lien of an assessment or reassessment or of a bond issued to represent the amount assessed on any lot, acre or parcel is held invalid by a court because a portion of the improvement ordered was not within the power of the board to order or was not properly embraced in the contract for the work or in the assessment made to cover the expenses, the district or the holder of a  bond secured by such assessment is entitled to a judgment determining what portion of the assessment is legal.  The district, within sixty days and pursuant to the directions of the judgment, shall issue a new assessment for an amount the court finds is the reasonable value of the portion of the improvement legally authorized by the proceedings.  This amount shall be reassessed against the property in the same manner and with the same effect as provided for issuing the original assessment, and may be enforced as an original assessment.

B. If the lien of an assessment or of a bond issued for an assessment amount is held invalid by a court for any cause arising after the authority of the board attaches to order the work, or if the lien is defeated or held invalid for any cause, and it also appears that the owner of the property at the time that the notice of the award of the contract was published had personal knowledge of the intention to order the award of the contract and has not filed an objection to the award of the contract, the district shall recover a judgment confirming the lien of that assessment on the lot, acre or parcel covered by the assessment in an amount the court finds the lot, acre or parcel to have actually benefited from the flood protection facility, not exceeding the amount that would have been properly assessed against the lot, acre or parcel.

 

#### Section 48-2848. Correctness of assessment; reallocation of assessment

A. After an assessment has been approved by the board, all persons having an interest in any lot, acre or parcel assessed may request the board in writing to modify or correct an assessment.  The board may order such a modification or correction of the assessment, on the record, together with the date it is made.  The modification or correction under this subsection does not affect the rights of persons under the assessment who have not joined in the request.

B. The board may reallocate all or part of an assessment as follows:

1. The board shall prepare a list of all assessments to be reallocated, including:

(a) The assessment number and legal description of and the amount assessed on each affected parcel before the reallocation.

(b) The assessment number and legal description of each affected parcel and the name and address of the owner as shown on the most recent tax roll.

(c) The amount to be assessed on each parcel after reallocation.

2. The board shall prepare an amendment to the assessment diagram reflecting the new assessment numbers and parcel boundaries.

3. The board shall mail a notice to each owner of an affected parcel showing the proposed reallocation and stating that the owner may file a written objection to the reallocation within twenty days after the notice was mailed.

4. If no objections are received within twenty days after the notice is mailed, the board may approve the proposed reallocation.  If timely objections are received, the board shall hold a hearing on the objections. The board shall mail notice of the hearing to all affected owners at least ten days before the hearing.  At the hearing, the objecting parties shall present evidence supporting their objections.  After the hearing, the board shall rule on all objections received and may approve the proposed reallocation or may make changes to the reallocation as the board considers necessary, and approve the reallocation as changed.  The board shall also approve the amendment to the assessment diagram as submitted or with changes the board considers to be necessary.

5. The board shall issue an order on the record approving the reallocated assessment and amended assessment diagram.

6. The amount assessed immediately after the reallocation shall be equal to the amount assessed immediately before the reallocation.

7. As a condition to reallocation, the board may require the affected property owners to pay the costs of reallocation, including engineering and legal costs, or may include the costs in the amount assessed against the affected parcels. The costs are due and payable as part of the next installment of the assessment.

 

#### Section 48-2849. Issuance of improvement bonds; fund for payment of bonds

A. The board may determine that improvement bonds shall be issued for the cost and expense of the flood protection facility.  The bonds shall be issued in the name of the flood protection district but shall be made payable only from the special fund collected by the flood protection district from special assessments levied and assessed on the lots, acres or parcels fronting on the flood protection facility or, if an assessment district has been created by the resolution of intention for the work, on the lots, acres or parcels included in the assessment district.

B. All amounts collected from the special assessments shall be placed in the special fund and shall not be used for any purpose other than payment of the principal and interest of the bonds.

#### Section 48-2850. Description of improvement bonds in resolution and notices

A. If the board determines that improvement bonds shall be issued, it shall state this in the resolution of intention for the work and shall specify the maximum rate of interest the bonds may bear. A similar description of the bonds shall be inserted in all notices of the proceedings required to be published, posted or mailed and a notice that the bonds will be paid from a special fund collected in not more than forty annual installments from the assessments remaining unpaid at the date of the issuance of the bonds or thirty days after the date of the warrant, or five days after the decision of the board on an objection to the assessment.

B. All other proceedings for the work up to and including the approval of the assessment by the board, including demand for payment of the several assessments and the return and recording, shall be conducted as provided in this article.

#### Section 48-2851. List of unpaid assessments; issuance of bonds; denominations; due date; certificate of completion

A. After the prescribed time from the date of the warrant has expired and after the flood protection district has recorded the return, the board shall make and certify a complete list of all unpaid assessments.

B. If any person, before certification of the list, presents to the board an affidavit that the person is the owner of a lot, acre or parcel on the list, accompanied by the certificate of a searcher of record that the person is the owner of record, and notifies the board, in writing, that the owner desires no bond to be issued for the assessment on the lot, acre or parcel, the assessment shall not be included in the list and shall remain collectible as provided in this article.  The failure to file the notice bars any defense against the bonds except for the defense that the board did not have authority to issue the bonds.

C. The clerk shall present the list to the district at its next meeting after the return has been recorded.  At any time after awarding a contract for construction or acquisition, the district, by resolution, may direct improvement bonds to be issued in an amount that does not exceed the amount of unpaid assessments as may be shown on the certified list of unpaid assessments. The resolution shall prescribe the maximum number and denomination of the bonds and the times when payable, which shall be fixed so that an approximately equal amount of principal is paid each year or any approximately equal aggregate amount of principal and interest is paid each year until the whole amount is paid.  The bonds shall mature in a period that does not exceed forty years and three months from the date of the bonds.  The denominations of the bonds shall be fixed by the district.  The district may provide in the form of the bond for redemption before maturity by giving such notice as the district determines to be reasonable and by the payment of a premium at redemption if the district determines a premium is advisable.  The resolution shall also fix the place, if any, other than the office of the treasurer, at which the bonds and the interest are payable.  The board may issue fully registered bonds and may issue bonds registered in the nominee name of a depository to provide for a book entry system to administer registration and payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the bonds.

D. The bonds shall be issued as of the date determined by the district and shall bear interest from that date at the rate not to exceed that specified in the resolution of intention.  The bonds shall have semiannual interest payments, the first of which is payable on January 1 or July 1, as the case may be, occurring at least ninety days after the later of the date of the bond or the expected completion of the work, and shall be for the interest accrued at that time.

E. The due date of all bonds is January 1 or July 1, as stated on the face of the bonds, in the years in which they become due, respectively.

F. The district may sell the bonds at public or private sale at a price at, above or below par and accrued interest to the date of payment, and at an interest rate not exceeding the maximum rate set in the resolution of intention.  If deemed necessary by the board of directors, a reserve fund may be established either with proceeds from the sale of the bonds or by increasing the collections of the annual installments of principal up to the first ten years the bonds are outstanding, over and above the amounts required to pay maturing principal on the bonds.  The monies in the reserve fund may be used only to cure deficits in the principal and interest funds or to pay interest and principal on the final maturity or maturities of the bonds.

G. The proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the treasurer and to be used to pay incidental expenses and payments for construction or acquisition.  If the district received sealed proposals for construction of the flood protection facility, the proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be used to make semimonthly or monthly payments to the contractor on a basis of ninety per cent of the value of the work actually performed as estimated by the district or engineer employed for those purposes to and including the fifteenth or last day of each calendar month. The balance shall be paid after the district has recorded a certificate of substantial completion of the flood protection facility, in the same manner as the recording of the assessment. The district shall record the certificate only after the work has been completed to its satisfaction.

H. If contracting services are procured pursuant to title 34, chapter 6, article 1, proceeds from the sale of the bonds shall be used to make monthly progress payments to the contractor as provided in section 34-609, subsection B except that notwithstanding any provision of title 34, the balance shall be paid after the work is substantially complete and the district has recorded a certificate of substantial completion of the flood protection facility in the same manner as the recording of the assessment.

I. The district shall mail a copy of the notice of completion to each property owner in the same manner as the notice of hearing on the assessment. Pending use of the bond proceeds, the treasurer may invest the proceeds in any investments for which sinking funds of this state may be invested or in a pooled investment fund established under section 35-326, except that if bond anticipation notes have been issued, the bond proceeds or so much as is necessary shall be used to redeem the notes.

J. Refunding bonds may be issued to refund all or any portion of an issue of bonds issued and sold pursuant to this section in the manner prescribed by title 35, chapter 3, article 4.

 

#### Section 48-2852. Form of bonds

A. The bonds shall be signed by the chairman or president of the board, attested by the clerk or secretary and sealed with the corporate seal of the district, and the interest coupons, if any, shall bear the facsimile signature of the chairman and secretary of the district.

B. The bonds shall be substantially in the following form:

_________________________ flood protection district of _________________________ improvement bond.

Know all men by these presents: that the _________________ flood protection district of _______________ county, Arizona (the "flood protection district"), a duly organized municipal corporation, promises to pay as hereinafter stated to the bearer hereof, on the ________ day of ________________, ____, the sum of _________________ dollars, together with interest on such sum, at the rate of ______________ per cent per annum, payable semiannually on January 1 and July 1 of each year.  Both principal and interest are payable at the office of the _________________ county treasurer (or paying agent) at the option of the holder.  The bond is issued in pursuance of law and is one of a series of ____________________ bonds of like tenor and date for the total sum of ____________________ dollars issued for that certain improvement in such flood protection district consisting of  (briefly describe improvement)  , initiated by resolution No. ___________ of _______________ flood protection district, and is payable only out of the special fund to be collected from special assessments imposed on the lots, acres or parcels of land fronting on or benefited by such improvement. Such special fund is set apart by law for the payment of such bonds and can be used for no other purpose.

It is hereby certified and declared that the improvement for which this series of bonds is issued is authorized by law, that all the acts, conditions and things required to be done, precedent to and in the issuing of this series of bonds, have been done or will be done, and performed in regular and due form as required by the law of this state and all resolutions of the flood protection district, that the special assessments out of which such bonds are to be paid are first liens on the property assessed, subject only to the lien for general taxes and prior special assessments, and any bona fide purchaser for value of this bond has the right to rely on the recitals contained in the bond. For the assessment or reassessment, collection and payment of such special assessments, the full faith and diligence of such flood protection district are hereby irrevocably pledged.

 

#### Section 48-2853. Certification of unpaid assessments; payments by installment; interest; payments in advance

A. The board, at the time it certifies the list of unpaid assessments, shall write the word "certified" on the record of the assessment opposite each unpaid assessment included in the list, and all assessments cease to be payable in cash and are thereafter payable only in equal annual installments on either January 1 or July 1, or semiannually on January 1 and July 1, of each year in which the bonds become due.  The board may provide a plan by which the annual installment plus an additional over levy as determined by the board to cover the anticipated delinquencies in the collection of the assessment may be collected in partial payments before the installment is due, and the lien of each assessment on the property assessed is, and remains, valid or until the assessment is fully paid.

B. An uncollected installment shall be added to the succeeding installment and paid, together with interest and penalties.

E. The board may provide for receiving payment of the installments of the assessments before they become due and may use the proceeds to redeem the bonds presented for redemption by the bond owners or invest the proceeds.  No investment of these monies may be made so as to prejudice the prompt payment of the bonds on the date they become due.

#### Section 48-2859. Bond anticipation notes; form; procedures applicable

A. If the board determines and states in the resolution of intention that improvement bonds shall be issued, bond anticipation notes may be sold at any time after the award of a construction contract.

B. Bond anticipation notes shall be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of improvement bonds and monies collected from property owners who want to pay all or part of their assessments in cash before the filing of the certified list of unpaid assessments as provided in section 48-2853.  The notes may be in such form and denomination as the board provides.  The notes shall be executed by the chairman of the board and attested by the secretary. The notes may bear interest from their date at a rate not in excess of the maximum rate shown in the resolution of intention. The term of the notes shall not be more than six months beyond the date set for completion of the construction.  The board may repay such notes before maturity and without penalty or extend the life of the notes if the term of the construction contract is extended or if any default is made by the contractor. The notes shall be authorized by resolution of the board.

C. The total amount of notes issued for any improvement shall not be greater than the aggregate of ninety per cent of the contract price and the total estimated amount of incidental expenses.  The notes shall be sold at not less than par at either public or private sale.  If authorized by the board, the chairman may enter into loan agreements with the purchaser of the notes relative to:

1. The time and place of delivery.

5. Payment of an additional fee to the purchaser of the note to cover the administrative expenses of the cash collections if the purchaser is the person to whom cash collections are made.

D. To secure the payment of the notes, the loan agreements may provide for a collateral assignment to the purchaser of the notes of all cash collections, the warrant and the district's interest in the performance bond.

E. The proceeds from the sale of the notes shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the treasurer and used for payment of incidental expenses and payments to the construction contractor.

F. Proceeds from the sale of the notes shall be used to make semimonthly or monthly payments to the contractor on a basis of ninety per cent of the value of the work actually performed, as estimated by the engineer employed for such purpose, up to and including the fifteenth or last day of each calendar month.  The balance shall be paid to the contractor after the sale of the bonds solely from the proceeds from the bond sale, or if bonds equal to the balance remaining cannot be sold, the balance shall be paid by delivery of a similar principal amount of bonds to the contractor.

G. The issuance of bond anticipation notes constitutes an assignment to the district of the monies due the contractor under the construction contract.

H. If bonds are issued to represent any assessments remaining unpaid on the date the list is certified, the district shall sell the bonds and use the proceeds to redeem the notes and pay the balance due to the contractor.

I. In addition to any incidental expenses included in the assessment, if bond anticipation notes are issued, the notes may also include in the incidental expenses all interest accruing on the bond anticipation notes, the added costs of cash collections, if any, and all legal or financial fees incurred in the issuance and sale of the bond anticipation notes.

J. If bond anticipation notes have been issued and the contractor has been paid in accordance with subsection F of this section, the district shall apply the proceeds collected from demands on the property owners to the reduction of the outstanding portion of the bond anticipation notes and, if the notes have been paid, to the contractor to reduce any balance due him.

#### Section 48-2860. Deficiency in collections

If there is a deficiency in the revenues collected from the special assessments by reason of the inadequacy of the method of collection, the district may make good the deficiency, reimbursing itself from the monies collected from the installments when they are received.

If a parcel of property that has been subjected to an assessment and a lien is exchanged to this state or the United States for another parcel of property in the flood protection district owned by this state or the United States, and the parcel of new private property receives substantially the same benefit from the improvement constructed as the parcel exchanged to this state or the United States, the assessment lien imposed on the original parcel of property may be transferred to and imposed on the parcel of new private property after the owner of the new private property has received a mailed notice of such assessment and an opportunity to object to either the transfer of the assessment lien to the new private property or the amount assessed against such new private property.

C. If the board of directors does not consider it to the best interests of the district to include therein the lands described in the petition, it shall reject the petition, but if the board deems it to the best interest of the district that such lands or any part thereof be included, the board may order the district changed to include therein the lands or any part thereof mentioned in the petition.

If, within five days after service of the notice, the owner, lessee, tenant or person in charge of any infested land fails to take adequate steps to eradicate the noxious plants complained of, or having begun work, neglects, fails or refuses to diligently prosecute the work to successful termination as provided in this section, the board of directors may order the inspector to enter on the premises and remove and eradicate the noxious plants. The inspector shall enter without further notice to the owner, lessee, tenant or person in charge. The cost and expense of removing and eradicating noxious plants from such premises is a lien on the premises with priority over other liens or obligations except liens for taxes.

#### Section 48-2998. Alternative plan to eradicate noxious plants

A. As an alternative to proceeding under section 48-2997, the board of directors may remove and eradicate noxious weeds, shrubs, vines or grasses from the district under this section. If the board elects to do so, it shall adopt a resolution containing:

1. A legal description, by tracts, parcels or lots, of the lands to be included in the proceeding. The resolution may embrace any number of contiguous tracts, parcels or lots, but each shall be separately described.

3. A declaration that the presence of the noxious plants constitutes a nuisance to other lands in the district.

4. A requirement that the owner, lessee, tenant or other person in charge of the land immediately eradicate the noxious plants and that if the person does not the district will proceed with the eradication.

5. The time and place where the board will hear objections of any owner of the lands and reasons why the district should not proceed to eradicate the noxious plants and with the assessment of the cost of the eradication against the tracts, parcels or lots of land affected.

B. Not less than five nor more than fifteen days before the date set for the hearing, the board shall cause a notice to be conspicuously posted at least three places not more than five hundred feet apart on the property described. The notice shall briefly recite the adoption of the resolution and the date of adoption, together with a statement of every material matter embodied in the resolution, including notice of the time, place and purpose of the meeting of protest, and that, unless the noxious plants are immediately removed and eradicated, the district will proceed with their removal. The notice shall be headed in capital letters not less than one inch in height, "notice to destroy noxious plants". The inspector or other person posting the notices shall report to the board the date the notices were posted.

C. At the time and place stated in the notice, the board shall hear protests against the proposed action and may continue the hearing from time to time. On conclusion of the hearing, the board, by motion or resolution, shall allow or overrule any objections, whereupon the board is deemed to have acquired jurisdiction to proceed with the work of eradication, and the decision of the board is then final.

D. After final action, or if no objections are received, the board may order its inspector to enter the premises described and eradicate the noxious plants. The inspector and the inspector's assistants may enter private property for that purpose.

E. A property owner has the right to eradicate noxious plants at the owner's own expense if done before the work by the inspector begins. If done to the satisfaction of the inspector and the board, no cost or assessments shall accrue against the particular tracts, parcels or lots of land on which the noxious plants have been eradicated.

F. The inspector shall keep an accurate account of the cost of the work done by the inspector or under the inspector's supervision and the expense incurred on each tract, parcel or lot of land and shall render an itemized report of the costs in writing to the board. A copy of the report shall be posted in the office of the board and a copy served on the owner of each tract, parcel or lot of land affected, if the owner can be found in the county.

G. At a time fixed by the board, not less than three days after filing the inspector's report, the board shall meet to discuss the report and hear objections or complaints to the report made by owners of the property liable for assessments. After hearing the objections, if any, and making amendments to or modifications of the report as the board deems proper, the board shall by motion or resolution confirm the report.

H. The cost, when fixed and determined under this section, constitutes a special assessment and a lien of the district against the respective tracts, parcels or lots of land described. The assessments shall then be certified by the board to the county treasurer who shall add them to the next regular statements for county taxes levied against the respective tracts, parcels or lots of land described. The county treasurer shall collect the amounts so assessed and levied at the time and in the manner, and subject to the same procedure and penalties for delinquency, as general county taxes.

The district tax and assessment liability of district lands shall at all times be a first charge against such lands, and all district taxes and assessments levied and assessed shall continue to be first liens against district lands except as otherwise expressly provided with respect to lands owned by the state or the United States.

#### Section 48-3160. Conversion of defaulted assessment into first mortgage lien

When a district is, for one year or more, in default in the payment of legally existing district obligations amounting to five dollars per acre or over, and an assessment has been authorized by vote of the qualified electors of the district as provided by section 48-3153, and levied by the district for the purpose of discharging the default or for the purpose of paying or refunding district indebtedness, or both, the assessment may be converted into negotiable first mortgage liens upon the lands located within the district and liable for such district taxes or assessments.

#### Section 48-3161. Order of conversion; notice to landowners

A. The board of directors may order such conversion by a resolution prescribing the aggregate amount of the lien per acre and the terms, conditions and procedure for accomplishing the conversion, the times, manner and method of payment and satisfaction of the converted lien, including the rate of interest which the converted lien shall bear and the times of payment thereof, but such interest shall not exceed seven per cent per annum.

B. The district secretary shall mail to the owner of each parcel of land within the district, at his last known address as it appears on the records of the district, a copy of the resolution, accompanied by a notice demanding that the landowner, within twenty days after the date of mailing the notice, execute a good and sufficient note or notes evidencing the amount of the converted lien, and a mortgage upon the lands of the owner located within the district and subject to the lien as security for payment of the note.

C. A copy of the resolution and notice shall be published at least once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the county in which the district office is located, the first of which shall be not less than twenty days prior to the date fixed by the notice for execution of the notes, mortgages or contracts therein mentioned.

B. No note, mortgage or similar document executed by the district secretary as provided in subsection A of this section shall impose any personal obligation upon the landowner in whose behalf the secretary executes a note, mortgage or other document, but the execution of the note, mortgage or other document executed by the secretary shall constitute a first mortgage lien against the premises involved in accordance with the tenor and provisions thereof.

C. When any assessment is levied for the purpose of refunding any bond or warrant obligation of the district, the assessment therefor may be paid with district bonds or warrants at the refunding value thereof and thereupon no lien shall be created under section 48-3159 upon such district lands.

#### Section 48-3163. Enforcement of liens against state or United States

Converted liens, except as otherwise provided in this article, shall be enforceable against any lands of the state or the United States in all respects as if the liens were upon lands held in fee and subject to the paramount lien or title of the state or United States.

#### Section 48-3164. Priority of mortgage liens

The mortgage liens into which assessments or tax liens are converted by mortgage, as provided by this article, shall constitute negotiable mortgage liens upon such lands in accordance with the priority established by the district board, notwithstanding the conversion of assessment or tax liens into mortgage or contract liens, and shall be prior and superior to all other liens or encumbrances except liens of state, county and district taxes not converted.

#### Section 48-3165. Conversion of district taxes into mortgage liens; priority

The board of directors may in the manner provided by this article for the conversion of district assessments, similarly convert into mortgage liens or contracts district taxes then levied and assessed, except taxes levied and assessed for payment of principal or interest on existing district bonds satisfaction of which is not then otherwise provided for, and may subordinate the liens so converted to any previous assessment lien converted into a realty mortgage lien or to a refunding bond issue. A district tax so converted may be fixed and established by the board as a lien prior and superior to any other lien or encumbrance then existing against the lands of the district except the preferred, prior and converted first mortgage liens, unsatisfied bond tax levies not then otherwise provided for, and state, county and district taxes thereafter assessed against such district lands.

#### Section 48-3166. Enforcement or foreclosure of other liens or demands subject to prior converted mortgage liens; exception; limitation on issuance of district bonds

A. All liens, charges and demands existing at the time of the conversion of district assessments into first mortgage liens, except state, county and district taxes and unconverted taxes and assessments, and all liens thereafter created except state, county and district tax liens, may only be enforced or foreclosed against lands covered by such mortgage liens subject to the prior converted mortgage liens.

B. No tax liability for the payment of principal or interest upon any subsequently issued district bonds shall be created against the district lands, except for the payment, redemption or satisfaction of the prior converted mortgage lien, until the prior converted mortgage and all thereof, together with interest, costs and penalties, have been paid or satisfied in full.

#### Section 48-3167. Agreement by board to guarantee payment of converted liens

The board of directors may enter into an agreement guaranteeing payment of the principal, any installment thereof, and interest thereon of converted liens as a district obligation. The agreement shall be in such form and tenor as may be approved by a two-thirds vote of the board of directors, and when so approved and executed shall thereafter be binding upon the district and irrevocable without consent of the parties thereto.

#### Section 48-3168. Tax lien for payment of bonds as superior to mortgage lien

Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to subordinate a tax lien for the payment of the principal or interest of district bonds in favor of a lien created under this article, but a district tax lien for the payment of principal and interest of outstanding district bonds shall remain in full force and effect until the principal of the bonds and the interest thereon is fully satisfied.

#### Section 48-3169. Rule making powers of board

The district board of directors may adopt necessary by-laws, ordinances, resolutions, rules and regulations not in conflict with the provisions of this article for carrying out the provisions and purposes of this article.

#### Section 48-3181. General plan for proposed works; engineering services

A. For the purpose of procuring necessary irrigation works, water and water rights, developing electrical energy and acquiring the necessary property in connection therewith and otherwise carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the board of directors of a district shall, as soon as practicable after the organization of the district, or as soon as practicable after a general plan theretofore adopted has been abandoned as provided by this article, by a resolution entered on its records, adopt a general plan of its proposed works.

B. The resolution shall state generally what works or property it is proposed to lease, purchase or acquire, what works it is proposed to construct, the estimated cost for carrying out the plan and how it is proposed to raise the funds necessary therefor.

C. For the purpose of ascertaining the estimated cost or value of any proposed work or water rights, and of definitely ascertaining the location and character of a storage reservoir, reservoirs, diversion dams, power plants, irrigation canals, laterals or other works proposed to be constructed, and of finally and accurately determining, defining and establishing the parcels of land susceptible of irrigation from the proposed works and the supply of water that will be made available for the irrigation thereof, the board of directors shall employ one or more competent engineers under whose direction and supervision shall be made:

1. All surveys, examinations, maps, plans, profiles, calculations and estimates necessary to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed works and furnish a proper basis for an estimate of the cost of carrying out the proposed works.

2. Such surveys, maps and detailed information as will accurately define, establish and delineate the parcels of land susceptible of irrigation in the proposed works.

3. Such analysis, data and information as will demonstrate the probable sufficiency of water for irrigation of the lands proposed to be reclaimed by the works.

#### Section 48-3182. Filing of maps and lists by board of directors prior to bond issue, construction contract or assessment; notice; submission of maps and lists to state certification board

Before a bond issue is voted upon, a construction contract entered into, or an assessment levied or toll or charge imposed for such major purposes, and when any new general plan is adopted, the board of directors shall:

1. File with the board of supervisors and county recorder of the county in which the major part of the lands proposed to be irrigated from district works are located a map or maps certified by the engineer or engineers and by the secretary of the district. The maps shall accurately delineate the boundaries of the district, the proposed location of storage reservoirs, diversion dams, power plants, irrigation canals, principal laterals and the parcels of lands proposed to be irrigated thereby.

2. At the time of filing the map or plat, file with the board of supervisors an accurate list certified by its engineer and the secretary of the parcels of land proposed to be irrigated from and to be charged with the cost of the construction.

3. After filing the map and list, publish once each week for a period of four weeks in at least one newspaper of general circulation in each county in which any part of the land is located a notice of filing the map and list. The notice shall contain a description of all lands described in the list and shall direct all persons to appear at a time not later than sixty days from the date of first publication of the notice and show cause before such board of supervisors why the parcels of land so listed, delineated and described should not be finally included within the district subjected to the cost and burdens of the proposed works. The notice shall further direct any and all persons to appear at the same time and place, and show cause why lands within the district omitted from the list should not be excluded from the district. The cost of publication of the notice shall be paid by the district.

4. Submit to the state certification board a certified copy of the engineer's report which shall embrace the map and list together with:

(a) All plats, profiles, general drawings, specifications and the engineer's calculations and cost estimates based thereon.

(b) A certified statement of the water analysis and data as compiled by the engineer with his calculations and deductions therefrom.

(c) A written estimate of the board of directors determining the amount of money necessary to be raised and the character and extent of the obligations to be undertaken to effect the adopted plans and purposes, including the payment of interest for not less than the first two years on the first bond issue.

#### Section 48-3183. Hearing; exclusion or inclusion of lands; acceptance of map and list

A. Upon the hearing if it appears that any parcel of land contained in the list prescribed by section 48-3182, paragraph 2 is not by reason of the location or character thereof susceptible of irrigation from the proposed works, the board of supervisors may in its discretion exclude such parcel. If it appears that a parcel of land within the district that has been omitted from the list is susceptible of irrigation from the proposed works the board may in its discretion add such parcel to the list. If it appears that all of the lands within the district which are susceptible of irrigation from the proposed works cannot be adequately and feasibly irrigated under the general plan adopted by the district, the board of supervisors shall reduce the acreage to such an amount as can be adequately and feasibly irrigated under the general plan by excluding from the district a sufficient acreage of the lands that are so located or are of such a character as to increase the average construction, maintenance or operation costs of the district.

B. After the hearing has been completed, and if no appeal therefrom is taken within thirty days thereafter, the board shall by resolution accept the map and list with such modifications as have been made by the board as a final allotment, delineation and description of the lands to be benefited by the proposed works and the certified list shall thereafter be the basis for all district taxes, assessments, tolls and charges levied by the district and the basis of the vote at all elections of the district.

#### Section 48-3184. Contents of resolution of exclusion when water supply insufficient for district lands

A. The lands omitted from the list as finally approved by the board of supervisors shall from the date of final approval cease to be a part of the district, but if at the hearing the board of supervisors excludes from the district lands susceptible of irrigation from the original proposed works, or some reasonable modification thereof or extension thereto, which have been found irrigable by the board of supervisors at a former hearing under a general plan approved by the state certification board which was thereafter abandoned, and if exclusion is made on the ground that the water supply estimated to be available under the proposed plan is not sufficient to provide a reasonably adequate supply for all of the irrigable lands in the district, the board of supervisors shall expressly find in the resolution of exclusion the following:

1. That such lands are susceptible of irrigation from the proposed original works or some reasonable modification or extension thereof.

2. That such lands are legally within the boundaries of the district and have been found irrigable by the board of supervisors at a former hearing under a general plan approved by the state certification board and thereafter abandoned.

3. That such lands are excluded from the district for the reason that the water supply estimated to be available under the proposed plan is not sufficient to provide an adequate supply for all the irrigable lands in the district.

B. The resolution of exclusion shall state the acreage of and describe the lands excluded by legal subdivisions or parts thereof, or other sufficient description.

#### Section 48-3185. Conveyance of land to district upon adoption of resolution of exclusion; mortgages by owners of inchoate titles; approval by state certification board

A. Upon adoption of a resolution of exclusion by the board of supervisors, and if no appeal is prosecuted therefrom within thirty days as provided in this chapter, each landowner within the district who desires irrigation water for his district lands from the proposed district works shall convey to the district a good and marketable title, free and clear of encumbrances, including all district and other taxes which became a lien prior to the conveyance, to the proportion of his irrigable land within the district after the exclusion that the excluded irrigable lands bear to the total acreage within the district before the exclusion. The land so conveyed to the district shall be a legal subdivision or rectangular part of a legal subdivision, or irrigable land selected by the grantor, subject to approval of the board of directors, or if the irrigable land owned by the grantor is an irregular tract, the land to be conveyed to the district may be an irregular tract if approved by the board of directors. The consideration for the conveyances to the district shall be the benefits to be derived by the grantor under this chapter. No owner of land within the district shall be entitled to irrigation water from the district works until he has conveyed to the district the percentage of land required by this section.

B. If an entryman of public lands is unable to convey title to the district to any part of his entry until a water supply is available therefor, or a purchaser from the state of land under a contract is unable to convey title to the district to any part of such land until the land is paid for in full, the board of directors may, in lieu of the conveyance, accept a mortgage on the entire entry or parcel under contract for an amount equal to the estimated value of the acreage of land that the entryman or purchaser of land would be required to convey to the district if his land were privately owned, the value to be estimated by the board of directors of the district as of the date when the land would be required to be sold if it were conveyed to the district pursuant to this section. The mortgage shall be payable at a reasonable time after a water supply is available for the entry or state land under contract and the proceeds therefrom shall become a part of the fund realized from the sale of lands conveyed to the district and be disbursed to the owners of excluded lands as a part of the fund.

C. If a landowner refuses or neglects to make a conveyance of his land to the district for more than sixty days after written request therefor by the board of directors, his lands shall be subject to exclusion from the district by order of the board of directors.

D. The state certification board shall not certify the bonds of an irrigation district until ninety per cent of the acreage of privately owned lands required by this section to be conveyed to the district have been conveyed to and accepted by the district.

#### Section 48-3186. Sale of lands under resolution of exclusion; disposition of proceeds; execution of mortgage by entrymen or lessees of state lands

A. The lands conveyed to the district pursuant to section 48-3185 shall be sold by the district at public sale when irrigation water is available for the lands and after the district obtains title thereto. The proceeds of the sale shall be paid into the district treasury. When the lands so conveyed are improved, the board of directors shall appraise the value which the improvements add to the land, and upon sale of the land the district shall pay to the landowner the appraised value of the improvements.

B. All sales of land made by the district under the resolution of exclusion shall be held at the door of the courthouse of the county in which the major part of the lands within the district is located. The notice of sale shall be published twenty-four consecutive times in a daily newspaper, or five consecutive times in a weekly newspaper, of general circulation in the county in which the sale is held, and by similar publication in the county in which the land to be sold is located if such lands are in a county other than the county where the sale is held.

C. As soon as practicable after any of the lands are sold the proceeds of the sale, less the necessary expenses of sale, and an amount equivalent to the district taxes per acre, plus six per cent per annum, which has been levied on other lands in the district between the date of the resolution of exclusion and the sale of the lands by the district, shall be divided among the owners of record at the date or dates of sale of the lands excluded from the district in proportion to the acreage of each as set forth in the resolution of exclusion adopted by the board of supervisors.

D. No owner of such excluded lands shall be paid such money until in consideration of the payment thereof he conveys to the district a good and marketable title, free of all taxes and encumbrances, to his excluded land, or if the land is held under a desert or homestead entry or under contract with the state, a mortgage is executed. Such mortgage shall be governed by the same provisions as mortgages executed by similar landowners on included land.

E. An owner of lands excluded from the district who is a successful bidder at the sale of any of the parcels of land sold by the district may be credited upon the purchase price the proportionate amount due him by reason of the conveyance to the district of his excluded land and the sale thereof.

#### Section 48-3187. Refund by district of taxes paid by owner of excluded lands

If any lands are excluded at the hearing by the board of supervisors on the ground that the lands may not be economically irrigated from the original proposed works, or some reasonable modification thereof or extension thereto, the district shall be obligated to pay to the person or persons owning the lands so excluded at the time of the exclusion thereof, all district taxes theretofore paid to the district treasury by any owner of the land, together with interest thereon at the rate of six per cent per annum.

#### Section 48-3188. Examination of engineer's report by state certification board; authority of board

A. The state certification board shall, immediately upon receipt of the engineer's report filed under the provisions of section 48-3182, paragraph 4, examine the report and make such additional examination at the expense of the district as it deems proper. As soon as practicable thereafter the state certification board shall make a report to the board of directors of the district in which it shall state generally its conclusions regarding:

1. The supply of water available for the project.

2. The nature of the soil proposed to be irrigated and its susceptibility to irrigation.

3. The probable amount of water needed for irrigation of such lands and the probable need for drainage.

4. The probable cost of the works, water rights and other property necessary for the project.

5. The appropriate dates of maturity for the bonds proposed to be issued for the project and whether in its opinion it is advisable to proceed with the proposed bond issue.

B. If the state certification board determines that the plans as adopted by the board of directors should be modified, or that the amount of bonds proposed to be issued should be changed, or that in its opinion it is not advisable to proceed with the proposed bond issue, it shall so state in its report to the board of directors. The report of the state certification board shall be made to the board of directors as soon as practicable, and within ninety days after receipt of the estimate of the board of directors.

#### Section 48-3189. Resolution adopting plan and calling for issuance of bonds; call for bond election

A. Upon receipt of the report of the state certification board the board of directors may determine and declare by resolution that its original plan of works or some modified plan recommended by the state certification board is adopted and that the amount of bonds as stated in its original estimate or a different amount suggested by the state certification board should be issued in order to raise the money necessary therefor.

B. Bonds issued for carrying out a plan disapproved by the state certification board shall not be certified for any purpose by the state certification board, or if any district issues bonds in an amount approved by the state certification board, the district shall not make any material change in the plans thereafter without written consent of the state certification board.

C. Immediately after adoption of the resolution determining the amount of bonds, the board of directors shall call an election at which shall be submitted to the qualified electors of the district the question of whether or not the bonds of the district in such amount shall be authorized. The election must be held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November as prescribed by section 16-204, subsection B, paragraph 1, subdivision (d).

 

#### Section 48-3190. Election to authorize issuance of bonds

Notice of election shall be given by posting notices in three public places in the district for at least twenty days prior to the date of the election and by publication thereof in a newspaper published in the county in which the office of the board of directors is located, once a week for at least three successive weeks prior to the election. The notice shall specify the time of holding the election, the maximum principal amount of bonds proposed to be issued, the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued and the maximum rate of interest which the bonds are to bear and the location of the polling places.

B. Except as otherwise provided, the election shall be held and the result thereof determined and declared in all respects as nearly as practicable in conformity with article 4 of this chapter governing the election of directors. No informalities in conducting the election shall invalidate the election if it has been otherwise fairly conducted.

C. At the election the ballot shall contain the words: "Bonds ¾ Yes," and "Bonds ¾ No,". To the right of and opposite each phrase shall be placed a square approximately the size of the squares placed opposite the names of candidates on ballots. The voter shall indicate his vote "Bonds ¾ Yes" or "Bonds ¾ No" by inserting the mark "X" in the square opposite such phrase. No other question, word or figure need be printed on the ballot. The ballot need not be of any particular size, and sample ballots are not required to be printed, posted or distributed. If the majority of the votes cast is "Bonds ¾ Yes," the bonds shall be sold at such times and in such amounts as the board of directors deems advisable.

D. When thereafter the board deems it for the best interest of the district that bonds be issued for district purposes and that the question of issuance thereof be submitted to the electors, the board shall adopt a resolution to that effect and record it in its minutes, and the board may thereupon submit the questions to the electors in the same manner and with like effect as at the previous election.

 

#### Section 48-3191. Incomplete title owners; liability for indebtedness

The board of directors shall require all owners of lands within the district for which title is incomplete at the time of issuing bonds to enter into a contract to the effect that the landowner will, upon receiving full title, permit the assessment of his land for his proportionate share of the bonded indebtedness of the district, and in the meantime pay his proportionate share of all other assessments levied by the board of directors. No vested or prescriptive right to the use of water of the district shall attach to the land by virtue of the contract until the land is subject to taxation for bond indebtedness as provided in this chapter. As soon as the landowner has received full title to the land, the land shall then become liable for all existing obligations and indebtedness of the irrigation district as fully and to every intent and purpose as if full title had been held by the landowner at the time of the organization of the irrigation district.

C. The secretary shall keep a record of the bonds sold, their number, date of sale, the price received and the name of the purchaser thereof.

#### Section 48-3193. Authorization of additional bonds; priority of liens

A. When the money realized from any series of bonds becomes exhausted and it becomes necessary to raise additional money for district purposes, additional series of bonds may be authorized by submitting the question of their issuance at a special election to the qualified electors of the district, and by complying with the provisions of this article in respect to the issuance of bonds. No series of bonds issued under this section shall have priority of lien or other priority over any other series of bonds, and no bond of a series shall have priority of lien or other priority over any other bond within the series.

B. Notice of such election shall be given, the election held and the returns thereof canvassed in the same manner as provided in this article for the authorization of bonds.

C. If the majority of votes cast at the election are in favor of cancellation of the bonds and abandonment of the general plan, the board of directors shall, after the result of the election has been entered upon its minutes, destroy the bonds so authorized to be cancelled if they have been prepared, and shall proceed to adopt a new general plan in all respects as if no general plan had been theretofore adopted. The board of directors shall proceed with appropriate proceedings before the board of supervisors and the state certification board for the authorization and sale of a new bond issue and the construction of district works in all respects as if no bond issue had been theretofore authorized.

D. If the majority of the votes cast at the election are against cancellation of the bonds and abandonment of the general plan, the board of directors shall enter the result of the election on its minutes and shall proceed with the sale of the bonds and construction of the proposed works as if the election had not been held, but if no part of such bonds are sold within one year after the date of such election the cancellation of the bond issue and the abandonment of the general plan may again be submitted to the electors of the district in the manner provided by this section.

E. In any district in which the major plan has been carried out and in which there remains unsold any bonds of a subsequent issue authorized for any special purpose, and the purposes for which the bonds were issued have been fulfilled or carried out in some other manner, and the unsold bonds have a par value of less than five hundred thousand dollars, the board of directors may by resolution, passed by a two-thirds vote, cancel and destroy the unsold bonds, and thereupon the board of directors shall cause the resolution of cancellation to be recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the office of the district is located and a certified copy thereof in any other county in which lands of the district are located.

A. The board of directors, or any qualified elector, taxpayer or real property owner within the district, may file an action for and on behalf of the district in the superior court of the county in which the office of the district is located for the purpose of determining the regularity and legality of the proceedings authorizing the issuance of district bonds. The action may be filed although none of the bonds have been sold.

B. The title of the action shall be "In the matter of the application of _______________ district for a determination as to the validity of (series number) _______________ of bonds of the district." The application shall state all the proceedings taken relative to the issue and sale of bonds described therein, and if filed by a party other than the board of directors, shall recite the interest of such party in the matter.

C. Upon the filing of the action the clerk shall issue a summons as in civil actions, except that the summons shall be directed to all persons who have or claim to have an interest in the bonds without specifically naming any other defendant or defendants. The summons shall be published in the same manner as summons are published against nonresident defendants in other civil actions in the superior court, and if the board of directors is not the applicant in the action, the summons shall be personally served upon at least one member of the board of directors in the same manner as provided for service of summons in other civil actions in the superior court.

D. Upon proof of publication being made and filed, and upon proof of service when personal service is required, the superior court shall have jurisdiction to proceed in the matter as in other civil actions commenced therein.

E. The issues shall be framed by a motion to dismiss the application for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The motion to dismiss shall be filed within thirty days after the date of the last publication of the summons unless the time is extended by order of the court. Any person interested may without pleading intervene and be heard upon the issues. Any persons interested may join in the motion to dismiss.

F. Upon filing of the motion the court shall hear and determine the issues at one hearing upon the law and facts, and after hearing shall enter such judgment as it determines upon the issues. The judgment shall be in writing and shall have the same effect as other judgments of the court. The costs of the proceeding shall not be taxed against any party thereto. The judgment may determine the legality and validity of, and approve and confirm, all the proceedings taken in the organization of the district under the provisions of this chapter, from and including the petition for the organization of the district, and all proceedings taken for the issuance of the bonds which may affect the validity of the bonds. The court shall disregard any error, irregularity or omission which does not affect the substantial rights of the parties.

G. A final judgment in the proceedings shall be res adjudicata in all courts of the state in all actions involving the validity of the bonds and the organization of the district.

The check shall be forfeited if after the acceptance of the bid the bidder refuses to accept the bonds and complete the purchase thereof on the conditions stated in the bid. The board in no event shall sell any of the bonds for less than eighty-five per cent of the face value thereof.

D. If no award is made, the board thereafter may either readvertise the bonds or any part thereof for sale, or sell them or any part thereof at private sale for not less than eighty-five per cent of the face value thereof.

E. The board may use any bonds which have been offered for sale at public sale which are unsold in payment for the construction of works of the district without calling for bids for such construction, and may enter into contracts providing for the payment of the construction in bonds. Such contracts may provide for payment of a fixed contract price, or the cost of construction plus a fixed percentage thereof, or the cost of construction plus a fixed amount, in the discretion of the board, but eighty-five per cent of the par value is the minimum price at which such bonds may be used in payment for construction, and such use of bonds and any such contract shall be approved by the state certification board.

A. On or before July 1 each year the board of trustees shall estimate the amount of money necessary to be raised by taxation to defray district expenses including assessments and charges to irrigation projects, if any have been assessed, up to the time when funds will be available from the next tax levy. The estimate shall take into account any deficit or surplus from the preceding year or years.

B. The board shall certify the estimate to the board of supervisors and the board shall annually, at the time county taxes are levied, levy a tax sufficient to raise the amount of the estimate, plus not less than fifteen per cent for anticipated delinquencies. District taxes shall be assessed and levied only on lands within the district and shall be apportioned among the several parcels of land on an acreage basis. If the board of trustees of a district fails to certify the estimate to the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors shall make a levy for the amount of the estimate certified the preceding year, plus fifteen per cent for delinquencies. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the taxes shall be assessed, levied and collected in the same manner as county taxes.

C. In order to entitle any parcel of land to water service, district taxes against such parcel may be paid to the treasurer separately from other taxes, and the county treasurer shall issue receipts therefor when so paid in such form that the receipt may be presented to the authorized representative of the district and recognized as authority to make delivery of water to such parcel of land. If the district taxes against any parcel of land are not paid separately, the county treasurer shall not omit the collection thereof at the time payment is made of other taxes for the same period against such parcel of land.

#### Section 48-3474. Credit on district taxes for irrigation project charges against lands within project

A. If any parcel of land within an irrigation water delivery district is part of an established irrigation project organized under any law of the state relating to irrigation, electrical or agricultural improvement districts, or of any reclamation project of the United States, and is subject to project taxes, assessments or charges payable directly to such district or project, exclusive of charges for service to such parcel of land under any contract or arrangement between the district or project and the irrigation water delivery district, the owner of the parcel of land shall be entitled to a credit on district taxes for any year equal to the amount of the assessments and charges paid to the district or project for that year. The county treasurer shall accept the receipt of any such project or district as evidence of payment, and shall give credit therefor by notation on his records. In the preparation of the annual estimate of expenses as provided by section 48-3473, all such credits shall be anticipated by the board of trustees and a corresponding adjustment made in the estimate of revenue necessary to meet the expenses of the district.

B. Any irrigation water delivery district may contract with an irrigation project within which any or all of the district lands are included, to pay project taxes, assessments or charges of the project on behalf of any or all of the lands of the irrigation water delivery district, and if such contract is executed the amount of such assessments and charges shall be added to the district estimate of expenses and assessed and levied as district taxes against the lands for and on account of which they are contracted to be paid.

#### Section 48-3475. Service charges payable other than by taxation

A. The board of trustees, at the time of making the annual estimate of expenses, shall estimate the amount of district expenses for a like period not to be paid from taxes. The estimate shall be based on subsisting contracts for furnishing or distributing water, costs of similar items in previous years and other available information, and the board shall fix a service charge, as uniformly distributed according to acreage as is practicable, over the parcels of land which the board anticipates will actually demand and receive irrigation service during the period, allowing a reasonable margin of not less than fifteen per cent for unforeseen contingencies and inaccuracy of estimate. The board may adopt a sliding scale of rates according to the cost of serving different sized parcels, as it deems equitable. If the operation of the district's irrigation system is provided for by contract with any individual, organization or irrigation project, the board of trustees shall fix the service charges in conformity with the terms of the contract.

B. If, in the discretion of the board of trustees, it is necessary to measure the water actually delivered to the parcels of property receiving irrigation water delivery service to determine the service charge, the board of trustees at the time of making the annual estimate of expenses shall estimate all expenses as provided in subsection A and estimate the total expected water use. The board may fix the service charge per unit measure of water, allowing a reasonable margin of not less than fifteen per cent for unforeseen contingencies and inaccuracy of estimate. The service charge for water actually used may be assessed directly by the board at periodic intervals, not to exceed twelve per year, against the parcels of land actually receiving irrigation service.

C. Rates for water service to district lands shall not be subject to regulation by the corporation commission.

#### Section 48-3476. Payment of district taxes required in advance

A. Before any particular parcel of district land is entitled to irrigation service, all district taxes and charges for the construction or repair of facilities standing against such parcel, whether for the current year or carried forward from a previous year or years, together with all penalties and interest for failure to make payment when due, shall be paid in full.

B. Any trustee who knowingly authorizes and effects the delivery of water to any parcel of district land on which the taxes and charges specified in subsection A have not been paid, shall be personally liable for payment thereof. If an individual, organization or irrigation project, having a contract with the district, delivers water to any parcel of district land for or on account of which such charges and taxes have not been paid, such individual, organization or irrigation project shall be liable to the district in the amount involved and the district may withhold such amount from any payments due such individual, organization or project until the payments have been made.

If sufficient monies are not available, the board may call an election of the electors of the district qualified to vote under article VII, section 13, Constitution of Arizona, to obtain approval for incurring bonded indebtedness of the district to obtain revenue to acquire by purchase, construction or otherwise all or any portion of such facilities.

B. After authority has been acquired for instituting a project within a zone or a joint project by two or more contiguous zones in a district established under this article, the board may order that the facilities approved in the project or joint project be acquired, constructed, operated and maintained from the monies held by the district treasurer for expenditure in the respective zone or zones. If sufficient monies are not available, the board may call an election of the electors of the zone, or of the zones for which a joint project has been authorized, who are qualified to vote under article VII, section 13, Constitution of Arizona, to obtain approval for incurring bonded indebtedness to obtain revenue to acquire by purchase, construction or otherwise all or any portion of the facilities.

C. The board resolution shall set forth the purpose of the indebtedness, the amount of the indebtedness, the maximum number of years for which the indebtedness is to be incurred, the maximum rate of interest to be paid and the date of the election and shall list the voting places to be used at the election.  The election must be held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November as prescribed by section 16-204, subsection B, paragraph 1, subdivision (d).  The resolution constitutes a notice of the election and shall be published once each week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of jurisdiction, or if there is no such newspaper, then notice shall be posted in not less than three public places within the area of jurisdiction, the first of which publications shall be not less than twenty days before the date fixed for the election. Publication on the same day of each week is sufficient whether or not a daily newspaper is used for the publication.

D. Except as otherwise expressly provided, the election shall be called and held and the results canvassed in the manner provided by the laws of this state for holding elections on the issuance of bonds by counties for general county purposes.  For purposes of the election the board may treat the entire district as a single precinct or may divide the district into such precincts and fix such polling places as it may see fit.

E. If a majority of the votes cast on the proposition is in favor of incurring the bonded indebtedness proposed, the bonds so authorized may be sold and issued by the board of directors either at one time or in blocks.

 

#### Section 48-3619. Form, issuance and sale of bonds; limitation on bonded indebtedness; payment of bonds and interest

A. The bonds authorized pursuant to section 48-3618 shall be issued for the general purpose or purposes provided in the voted proposition, which may be the acquisition by purchase, construction or otherwise of any facilities designed to further the objects or purposes of the district or for improving and extending any such facilities, or any combination of such purposes, and may include the payment of all legal, engineering and fiscal expenses reasonably incurred in connection with the authorized purposes of the bonds and with the authorization and issuance of the bonds as well as expenses incurred in connection with the original organization of the district. The bonds shall be fully negotiable for all purposes and shall never be issued in an amount which:

1. Together with all other existing bonded indebtedness of the district then outstanding, exceeds in total principal amount five per cent of the assessed valuation of taxable property in the district as computed from the last assessment roll for county purposes completed before issuing the bonds.

2. Together with all other existing bonded indebtedness of a zone then outstanding for which the property of a zone is subject to tax under this article, exceeds in total principal amount five per cent of the assessed valuation of taxable real property in the zone as computed from the last assessment roll for county purposes completed before issuing the bonds.

B. The limitation on bonded indebtedness does not apply in those districts or zones which embrace portions of two or more irrigation districts which have water delivery contracts with the United States pursuant to federal reclamation laws.

C. The bonds are the general obligations of the district, zone or zones and the full faith, credit and resources of the district, zone or zones shall be pledged for their payment. The board shall certify to the board of supervisors to levy annually on all taxable real property in the district, zone or zones secondary property taxes fully sufficient without limitations as to rate or amount to pay principal of and interest on such bonds as principal and interest fall due.

D. The bonds shall mature at such time or times not more than forty years from their date, shall bear interest at such rate or rates set by the accepted bid which shall not exceed the maximum rate of interest stated in the resolution calling the election, shall be payable at such place or places within or without this state and generally shall be issued in such manner and with such details as may be provided in the resolution. The bonds may be made callable on any interest payment date at a premium not to exceed three per cent of their face amount. If the district has any source of revenues other than from the proceeds of taxes, all or such part of the revenues as the board of directors may deem advisable may, in the discretion of the board, be pledged to the payment of the bonds.

E. The board may provide in the resolution authorizing bonds that the bonds shall recite that they are issued under authority of this article. Such recital conclusively imports full compliance with this article and all bonds issued containing the recital are incontestable for any cause whatsoever after their delivery for value.

F. The board may provide for the publication of any resolution or other proceeding adopted by the board in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of jurisdiction. For a period of thirty days after the date of publication any person in interest may contest the legality of the resolution or proceedings of any bonds which may be authorized, or the provisions made for the security and payment of the bonds, and after such time no person has any cause of action to contest the regularity, formality, legality or source of payment for any cause whatsoever.

G. Subject to this section, the board shall declare by resolution its intention to sell such bonds and shall fix the date, hour and place of sale and shall give notice of the sale of the bonds by publication for at least ten days in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of jurisdiction and in any other newspaper as the board directs. The notice shall state that sealed bids only will be received by the board for the purchase of the bonds, and the bonds will be awarded to the highest responsible bidder at a price of not less than par and accrued interest, and that a good faith check equal to two per cent of the principal amount of bonds to be sold must accompany all sealed bids. The board may reject any and all bids. The bonds may be in denominations or multiples of one thousand dollars and shall be signed by such officers of the board as are designated by resolution adopted by the board. Any bonds bearing the signature of officers in office at the date of signing are valid and binding for all purposes, notwithstanding that before their delivery any such person whose signature appears on the bonds may no longer be an officer.

H. Bonds may be issued by the district after the issuance of all of the first bonds but must be issued pursuant to the making of a supplemental engineer's program and a hearing as prescribed in this section.

I. Bonds issued under authority of this article do not enjoy a priority over other bonds issued under this article by reason of time of authorization or issuance. Bonds issued under this article are not taxable by this state or by any county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state.

J. All bonds issued under this article are legal investments for all trust funds, including those under jurisdiction of this state, and for the funds of all insurance companies, banks and trust companies, for the investment of state monies and for all sinking funds under the control of this state and political subdivisions of this state.

#### Section 48-3620. Certification and levy of taxes; limitation

The aggregate taxes levied for any year under this article on property in a zone for the purposes listed in subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section in a district located in a county having a population of less than six hundred thousand persons according to the most recent United States decennial census, if added to the aggregate taxes, if any, levied for the purposes listed in subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, shall not exceed twenty per cent of the county primary property tax rate exclusive of the state equalization assistance property tax rate or fifty cents per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation, whichever is greater. The taxes levied under this article in a district located in a county having a population of less than six hundred thousand persons according to the most recent United States decennial census may exceed the limits prescribed by this subsection if approved by a majority of the qualified electors of the district voting in a regular general election held pursuant to title 16, chapter 2, article 2 or at a special election held pursuant to title 16, chapter 2, article 3. The ballot for the election shall specifically state the proposed rate and the fiscal year or years in which the excess tax levies are proposed to be assessed.

#### Section 48-3620.01. Joint projects by zones

A. For the purpose of acquiring authority to proceed with any project of special benefit to a zone, as well as for the purpose of acquiring authority to proceed with any joint project by any two or more contiguous zones, as provided by section 48-3620.01, the board of directors shall adopt a resolution stating its intention to undertake the zone project or joint project, together with the engineering estimates of the project's cost to be borne by any participating zones, fixing a time and place for a public hearing on the resolution once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected zone or zones, the first of which publications shall be at least ten days before the date fixed for the hearing or, if there is no such newspaper, by posting the notice for two consecutive weeks before the hearing in three public places in each of the affected zones. The notice shall designate a public place in each of the zones where a copy of the map or maps of any joint project may be seen by an interested person.

B. At the time and place fixed for the hearing or at any time to which the hearing may be continued, the board shall consider all written and oral objections to the proposed project or joint project.

If a district determines that an application for a license is not administratively complete, the district shall include a comprehensive list of the specific deficiencies in the written or electronic notice provided pursuant to subsection D of this section. If the district issues a written or electronic notice of deficiencies within the administrative completeness time frame, the administrative completeness review time frame and the overall time frame are suspended from the date the notice is issued until the date that the district receives the missing information from the applicant.  The district may issue an additional written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies based on the applicant's submission of missing information.  If the permit sought requires approval of more than one department of the district, each department may issue an additional written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies based on the applicant's submission of missing information.

F. If a district does not issue a written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies within the administrative completeness review time frame, the application is deemed administratively complete. If a district issues a timely written or electronic notice of deficiencies, an application shall not be complete until all requested information has been received by the district.  A district may consider an application withdrawn if by fifteen days or longer after the date of the notice, as established by the district, the applicant does not supply the documentation or information requested or an explanation of why the information cannot be provided within the established time period.

G. During the substantive review time frame, a district may make one comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections. If the district identifies legal requirements that were not included in the comprehensive request for corrections, the district may amend the comprehensive request for corrections once to include the legal requirements and the legal authority for the requirements. If the permit sought requires approval of more than one department of the district, each department may issue a comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections.  If the applicant fails to resolve an issue identified in a request for corrections, the district may make supplemental written or electronic requests for corrections that are limited to issues previously identified in a comprehensive request for corrections. If a district issues a comprehensive written or electronic request or a supplemental request for corrections, the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame are suspended from the date the request is issued until the date that the district receives the corrections from the applicant. If an applicant requests significant changes, alterations, additions or amendments to an application that are consistent with the purposes of the original application and that are not in response to a request for correction, a district may make one additional comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections and may have no more than an additional fifty per cent of the substantive review time frame as established by the district for that license to grant or deny the license. Nothing shall prevent communication between a district and an applicant regarding a comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections or a supplemental request for corrections.  A district may consider an application withdrawn if, by thirty days or more after the date of notice, as established by the district, the applicant does not supply the documentation or information requested or an explanation of why the information cannot be provided within the established time period.

H. Nothing shall prevent the district from continuing to process the application during the suspension of the substantive review time frame and overall time frame.

I. By mutual written or electronic agreement, a district and an applicant for a license may extend the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame.  An extension of the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame may not exceed fifty per cent of the overall time frame.

J. Unless a district and an applicant for a license mutually agree to extend the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame pursuant to subsection I of this section, a district shall issue a written or electronic notice granting or denying a license to an applicant. If a district denies or withdraws an application for a license, the district shall include in the written or electronic notice at least the following information:

1. Justification for the denial or withdrawal with references to the statutes, ordinances, executive orders, substantive policy statements or delegation agreements on which the denial or withdrawal is based.

2. An explanation of the applicant's right to appeal the denial or withdrawal. The explanation shall include the number of working days in which the applicant must file a protest challenging the denial or withdrawal and the name and telephone number of a district contact person who can answer questions regarding the appeals process.

3. An explanation of the applicant's right to resubmit the application, the total amount of fees that will be assessed if the applicant resubmits the application and the method in which the fees were calculated.

K. If a district does not issue to the applicant the written or electronic notice granting or denying a license within the overall time frame or within the mutually agreed upon time frame extension, the district shall refund to the applicant all fees charged for reviewing and acting on the application for the license and shall excuse payment of any fees that have not yet been paid.  The district shall not require an applicant to submit an application for a refund pursuant to this subsection.  The refund shall be made within thirty working days after the expiration of the overall time frame or the time frame extension.  The district shall continue to process the application.  Notwithstanding any other statute, the district shall make the refund from the fund in which the application fees were originally deposited. The right to receive a refund of fees charged for reviewing and acting on the application for the license may not be waived by the applicant.

L. If an application for a license is denied because revisions or corrections were not submitted or considered within the allowed time frame, or withdrawn, and the applicant resubmits the application for the same purposes with only revisions or corrections to the original application, the district shall not assess any additional fees that exceed fifty per cent of the original permit fee that has not been refunded to the applicant provided that the application is submitted before the time of destruction of the original application file pursuant to section 41-151.15. This subsection does not apply to license applications that were denied for disqualifying criminal convictions or that were submitted fraudulently.

M. This section does not apply to a license that is either:

1. Issued within seven working days after receipt of the initial application or a permit that expires within twenty-one working days after issuance.

### Article 4 - Replenishment

#### Section 48-3771. District replenishment obligations; replenishment location; source of replenishment; exception

A. For each active management area in which member lands or member service areas are or may be located, the district shall replenish groundwater in an amount equal to the groundwater replenishment obligation for that active management area.  Except as provided in section 48-3781, subsection G, the district shall complete the replenishment of the groundwater replenishment obligation of that active management area applicable to a particular year within three full calendar years after the year that the district incurs the groundwater replenishment obligation. Replenishment of the groundwater replenishment obligation of an active management area applicable to a particular year is complete when the amount of water added to aquifers through water storage that has been credited directly to the district's conservation district account pursuant to title 45, chapter 3.1, plus long-term storage credits that have been transferred from the district's long-term storage account to its conservation district account pursuant to title 45, chapter 3.1, less the groundwater replenishment obligation of member lands and member service areas located in the active management area and applicable to previous years, less the contract replenishment obligations relative to municipal providers in the active management area for previous years and the year of the calculation, equals or exceeds the groundwater replenishment obligation of the active management area for that year.

B. With respect to the portion of the groundwater replenishment obligation attributable to a parcel of member land or a member service area, the district shall replenish groundwater in the active management area where the parcel of member land or the member service area is located in an amount equal to the groundwater replenishment obligation applicable to that parcel of member land or that member service area.

C. Except as provided by title 45, chapter 3.1, the district may replenish groundwater with central Arizona project water or water from any other lawfully available source except groundwater withdrawn from within an active management area.

D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if a parcel of member land is included in the service area of a municipal provider that is not a member service area but that has been designated as having an assured water supply under section 45-576, the parcel of member land has no parcel replenishment obligation and the district has no groundwater replenishment obligation attributable to that parcel of member land for as long as the designation remains in effect.

E. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if a parcel of member land is included in the service area of a municipal provider that is a member service area and that has been designated as having an assured water supply under section 45-576, the parcel of member land has no further parcel replenishment obligation.

The amount of the activation fee to be paid to the district under subdivision (c) of this paragraph must be the amount of the activation fee in effect at the time of payment. Revenues from the activation fee together with revenues from other sources that are legally available to the district for those uses shall be used by the district to acquire, lease or exchange water or water rights and develop infrastructure necessary for the district to perform its replenishment obligations.

8. For any year, set all of its rates and charges associated with the acquisition, lease or exchange of water or water rights and development of infrastructure necessary for the district to perform its replenishment obligations, other than the annual membership dues established pursuant to section 48-3779, so that the total projected revenues from revenue sources other than the annual membership dues, that are legally available to the district in that year to pay costs associated with the acquisition, lease or exchange of water or water rights and development of infrastructure necessary for the district to perform its replenishment obligations, shall be at least three times the total projected revenues from the annual membership dues in that year. For the purposes of this paragraph, costs associated with the acquisition, lease or exchange of water or water rights do not include the annual costs associated with delivery of water for replenishment purposes.

B. The district may:

1. Acquire, develop, construct, operate, maintain, replace and acquire permits for water storage, storage facilities and recovery wells for replenishment purposes.

2. Acquire, transport, hold, exchange, own, lease, store or replenish water, except groundwater withdrawn from an active management area, subject to the provisions of title 45, for the benefit of member lands and member service areas.

3. Acquire, hold, exchange, own, lease, retire or dispose of water rights for the benefit of member lands and member service areas.

4. Require municipal providers to provide such information, in such form and within the time limits prescribed by the district, as may be necessary to carry out the purpose of this chapter.

9. Subject to subsection G of this section, contract with any municipal provider having a member service area to replenish groundwater on behalf of the municipal provider and with respect to the member service area in an amount in excess of the sum of the service area replenishment obligations applicable to the member service area for all years in which the district has not completed the replenishment of the groundwater replenishment obligation for the member service area.

10. Adopt resolutions granting water availability status to a member service area of a city, town or private water company and committing to replenish a specified average annual volume of water in a location where the city, town or private water company may physically access the water for service to its customers, if all of the following apply:

(a) The district has reviewed its requirements for transportation of central Arizona project water, its contracts, subcontracts, letter agreements, excess water contracts and other contractual obligations and its member service area and member land requirements and has determined that the district can meet those obligations and that capacity remains in the central Arizona project to meet the obligations undertaken through the resolution.

(b) The resolution acknowledges that the commitment to replenish the specified average annual volume of water in the location cited in the resolution shall be a permanent obligation of the district, unless one of the following applies:

(i) A permanent substitute supply of water is found for the city, town or private water company and the substitution is approved by the director of water resources, thus terminating the water availability status of the member service area.

(ii) The requirements of section 45-576.07, subsection A are not met, and thus the director of water resources does not issue an order granting or maintaining the city, town or private water company as having an assured water supply based in whole or in part on section 45-576.07. If no order is issued within two years of the district adopting the resolution, the resolution may be repealed, and the district shall be relieved of all obligations under the resolution.

(a) The district has reviewed its requirements for transportation of central Arizona project water, its contracts, subcontracts, letter agreements, excess water contracts and other contractual obligations and its member service area and member land requirements and has determined that the district can meet those obligations and that capacity remains in the central Arizona project to make direct deliveries pursuant to this paragraph.

(b) The district determines that the delivery will not increase annual replenishment assessment rates or costs to central Arizona project contract and subcontract holders, its member service area and member lands.

12. Enter into agreements with a city, town or private water company that will have water made available to it through a resolution adopted pursuant to paragraph 10 of this subsection and under which the city, town or private water company compensates the district for the costs and fair value of the water supply provided by the district.

13. Issue revenue bonds pursuant to article 3 of this chapter to fund the costs and expenses of the district for the acquisition, lease or exchange of water or water rights and the development of infrastructure necessary for the district to perform its replenishment obligations subject to the following:

(a) The principal of, interest and premiums, if any, on revenue bonds issued pursuant to article 3 of this chapter to acquire, lease or exchange water or water rights and develop infrastructure necessary for the district to perform its replenishment obligations are not payable from any revenues of the district other than revenues generated or collected pursuant to this article that are legally available to the district for those purposes and revenues from the investment of the proceeds of the bonds.

(b) The district may not use the proceeds of the bonds to acquire or lease:

(i) Groundwater, as defined in section 45-101, except as expressly authorized in sections 45-547, 45-553 and 45-554.

(ii) Surface water, as defined in section 45-101, that is the subject of a general adjudication pursuant to title 45, chapter 1, article 9.

C. The functions of the district under subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section may be performed on behalf of the district by other persons under contract with the district.

D. The capital costs of the facilities of any state demonstration projects used by the district pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 8 of this section shall not be included in the capital costs and expenses established by the district under subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section.

E. The district shall establish and maintain a replenishment reserve as follows:

1. The district shall calculate a reserve target for each of the three active management areas within the district and shall identify the reserve target in the plan of operation prepared pursuant to section 45-576.02. The reserve target for each active management area shall be calculated as follows:

(a) For each active management area, add together the projected replenishment obligation for each of the one hundred years following submission of the plan of operation. For the purposes of this subdivision, each active management area's projected replenishment obligation does not include replenishment obligations under resolutions adopted pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 10 of this section or replenishment obligations for category 2 member lands.

(b) Subtract from the sum of the active management area's projected replenishment obligation over the one hundred-year period the sum of the following volumes of water derived from sources identified in the plan as water that the district plans to use to meet its replenishment obligations for that active management area:

(i) The annual volume of each nondeclining, long-term municipal and industrial subcontract for central Arizona project water multiplied by one hundred.

(ii) The annual volume of water under leases or contracts that can be made physically and legally available to the district consistent with the rules adopted pursuant to section 45-576, subsection H, multiplied by the number of years, not to exceed one hundred, in which the water is to be made available to the district. The water need not be continuously available to be included in this item. A lease or contract shall not be considered under this item if the water to be made available under the lease or contract is for a term of less than twenty years.

(iii) The total volume of groundwater that the district plans to transport to the active management area during the next one hundred years as allowed by title 45, chapter 2, article 8.1.

(iv) The total volume of all sources of water not identified in items (i), (ii) or (iii) of this subdivision that will not be held by the district under a lease or contract. Volumes to be included under this item must be consistent with the rules adopted by the director pursuant to section 45-576, subsection H.

(c) Multiply the result from subdivision (b) of this paragraph by twenty percent. The result is the reserve target for the active management area.

2. The reserve target for an active management area may be adjusted by the district, subject to the approval of the director of water resources, based on changes in either of the following:

(a) The active management area's projected replenishment obligation.

(b) The volumes of water identified in the plan of operation prepared pursuant to section 45-576.02 as water that the district plans to use to meet its replenishment obligations for that active management area.

3. The district shall include a replenishment reserve charge in the annual replenishment assessment levied against all parcels of category 1 member land as provided in section 48-3774.01 and in the annual replenishment tax levied against all municipal providers that have member service areas as provided in section 48-3780.01. The replenishment reserve charge for each active management area is established annually by the district based on the reserve target for that active management area.

4. The district shall levy a replenishment reserve fee against category 1 member lands pursuant to section 48-3774.01 and against member service areas pursuant to section 48-3780.01.  For category 1 member lands the fee is equal to twice the applicable replenishment reserve charge multiplied by the total projected average annual replenishment obligation for the member lands as reported by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-578, subsection F. For member service areas the fee is equal to twice the applicable replenishment reserve charge multiplied by the excess groundwater increment.  With the approval of the district and the director of water resources, long-term storage credits as defined in section 45-802.01 may be assigned to the district's replenishment reserve subaccount in lieu of paying the replenishment reserve fee.

5. The district shall use replenishment reserve charges and replenishment reserve fees collected within each active management area together with all interest earned on the charges and fees to store water in that active management area in advance of groundwater replenishment obligations for the purpose of developing long-term storage credits as defined in section 45-802.01 that shall be credited to the replenishment reserve subaccount for that active management area as provided in section 45-859.01.

6. Beginning on January 1, 2030 or earlier, on approval of the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-859.01, subsection K, the district may transfer credits from a replenishment reserve subaccount to a conservation district account as provided in section 45-859.01 to satisfy its groundwater replenishment obligations.

7. If the district transfers credits from the replenishment reserve subaccount for an active management area pursuant to section 45-859.01, subsection E, the district shall include in the annual replenishment assessment levied against all parcels of category 1 member land in that active management area and, except as provided in section 48-3780.01, subsection B, in the annual replenishment tax levied against all municipal providers that have member service areas in that active management area a reserve replacement component to fund the replacement of the transferred credits. The district shall use all monies from the reserve replacement component collected within an active management area together with all interest earned on the monies to develop long-term storage credits as defined in section 45-802.01 within that active management area to be credited to the replenishment reserve subaccount for that active management area as provided in section 45-859.01.

8. For the purposes of establishing and maintaining the replenishment reserve, the district shall have access to excess central Arizona project water equivalent to but not more than the access the Arizona water banking authority has for the purposes specified in section 45-2401, subsection H, paragraph 2.

F. Groundwater replenished by the district pursuant to a contract to replenish groundwater under subsection B, paragraph 9 of this section shall not be credited to a replenishment reserve subaccount established under section 45-859.01.

G. The district shall not enter into a contract authorized under subsection B, paragraph 9 of this section unless the district has determined that the contract will not adversely affect the district's ability to fulfill its obligations under this chapter. For each contract entered into under subsection B, paragraph 9 of this section, the district shall perform its contract replenishment obligations in the active management area in which the service area of the municipal provider that is the party to the contract is located.

H. If the district replenishes groundwater on behalf of a municipal provider pursuant to a contract to replenish groundwater under subsection B, paragraph 9 of this section, the amount of groundwater so replenished shall be a replenishment credit to the municipal provider that may be applied by the municipal provider on notice to the district to reduce the service area replenishment obligations applicable to the municipal provider.

I. In the Phoenix active management area, the district, to the extent reasonably feasible, shall replenish groundwater in the east portion of the active management area and in the west portion of the active management area in the approximate proportion that the groundwater replenishment obligation attributable in a particular year to member lands and member service areas located in the east portion of the active management area bears to the groundwater replenishment obligation attributable in that year to member lands and member service areas located in the west portion of the active management area.  For the purposes of this subsection, the boundary between the east Salt river valley subbasin and the west Salt river valley subbasin is the boundary between the east and west portions of the active management area.

J. The costs and expenses charged by the district to an active management area water district established under chapter 28 of this title for delivery of surplus central Arizona project water to such active management area water district for replenishment purposes shall not exceed the costs and expenses for delivery of such water that are or would be included by the district in the costs and expenses of replenishment for member lands and member service areas within the active management area in which such active management area water district is situated.

#### Section 48-3773. Additional duties; special fund; revolving fund

A. In carrying out the groundwater replenishment obligations prescribed in section 48-3772, subsection A, the district shall:

1. Adopt bylaws, rules, ordinances and policies for the governing of the district and the performance of the groundwater replenishment obligations.

A. On or before the third Monday of August of each year after the qualification of any real property as member land, the district shall charge an annual replenishment assessment against each parcel of member land that is subject to a parcel replenishment obligation. This charge becomes a lien on the parcel and shall be collected in the same manner as an ad valorem tax. The assessments shall be calculated by the district pursuant to this article and shall be sufficient to produce the amount of money estimated as needed to pay the costs and expenses to replenish groundwater established under section 48-3772, subsection A and taking into account any annual replenishment tax levied against municipal providers under section 48-3781.

B. The district shall promptly certify the assessments to the board of supervisors of each county in which member lands are located, and these boards of supervisors at the time of levying general county taxes shall take the necessary steps for collection of replenishment assessments against the parcels of member land within such county.

C. The assessment when collected shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the special fund established under section 48-3773, subsection A, paragraph 3 to be spent by the district only for the purposes authorized by this article.

#### Section 48-3779. Annual membership dues

A. On or before the third Monday of August of each year beginning in 2011, the district may charge annual membership dues on all parcels of member lands and on all municipal providers having a member service area.

B. The annual membership dues shall be established annually by the district.  The district shall use revenues from the annual membership dues, together with revenues from other revenue sources that are legally available to the district for those uses, solely to pay costs associated with the acquisition, lease or exchange of water or water rights and development of infrastructure necessary for the district to perform its replenishment obligations, including the payment of debt service expenses, and necessary reserves and coverage requirements, on bonds issued for replenishment purposes.

C. For any year in which the district has, or expects to have, any revenue bonds outstanding that were issued for replenishment purposes pursuant to section 48-3772, subsection B, paragraph 13, the annual membership dues shall be established in an amount determined by the district to be sufficient to provide, with other revenues legally available to the district for those purposes, and taking into account the requirements of section 48-3772, subsection A, paragraph 8, for the payment of all debt service expenses, including necessary reserves and coverage requirements with respect to the bonds.

D. When the district has determined the amount of revenues to be raised through the annual membership dues, the district shall allocate the amount to be raised between member lands and member service areas prorated on the basis of the following two volumes:

1. Total current and projected annual replenishment obligation of all member lands as identified in the most recent plan of operation determined by the director of water resources to be consistent with achieving the management goal for the active management areas pursuant to section 45-576.03, subsection M, O or R.

2. Total planned annual service area replenishment obligations for all member service areas. The planned annual service area replenishment obligation for a member service area is the lesser of:

(a) The annual service area replenishment obligation, as determined by the district, associated with the current and committed water demands projected within the member service area as of December 31 of the year following the year in which the district is required to submit its next plan under section 45-576.02, subsection C.

(b) The maximum amount of excess groundwater that may be reported to the district as delivered by the municipal provider within the member service area in any year as established in an agreement executed between the municipal provider and the district.

E. The total amount allocated to member lands in any year, as calculated pursuant to subsection D of this section, shall be prorated among the Phoenix, Pinal and Tucson active management areas based on the current and projected annual replenishment obligation of all member lands in that active management area as identified in the most recent plan of operation determined by the director of water resources to be consistent with achieving the management goal for the active management area pursuant to section 45-576.03, subsection M, O or R. The prorated amount within each active management area shall be further prorated among all parcels of member land located within that active management area based on a uniform fee per lot levied against the total number of residential, commercial and common area lots included, or intended to be included, in each parcel of member land.  These dues are a lien on each parcel of member land and shall be certified, collected and enforced with respect to member land in the same manner as the annual assessment pursuant to section 48-3778.  However, any parcel of member land that is included in the service area of a municipal provider that has been designated as having an assured water supply under section 45-576 is not subject to the annual membership dues.

F. The total amount allocated to member service areas in any year, as calculated pursuant to subsection D of this section, shall be prorated among all member service areas based on a uniform fee per acre-foot levied against the member service area's dues volume.  The dues volume for a member service area is the greater of:

1. The planned annual service area replenishment obligation as established pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 2 of this section for the member service area.

2. Five per cent of the service area's annual estimated water demand to be satisfied with excess groundwater as identified in the service area's most recent designation order issued by the director of water resources.  If the service area's most recent designation order issued by the director of water resources does not identify the annual estimated water demand to be satisfied with excess groundwater, the service area's annual estimated water demand to be satisfied with excess groundwater shall be calculated consistent with the rules adopted by the director pursuant to section 45-576, subsection H.

G. Except in the first full year following the year in which the director makes a determination that the district's most recent plan of operation is consistent with achieving the management goals of the active management areas pursuant to section 45-576.03, subsection M, for any year in which the dues volume for a member service area, as determined pursuant to subsection F of this section, exceeds the previous year's dues volume for the member service area, a makeup charge shall be added to the annual membership dues allocated under subsection F of this section to the member service area. The makeup charge shall become part of the member service area's annual membership dues for that year and is the sum of:

1. The difference between the current year's dues volume and the previous year's dues volume, in acre-feet, multiplied by the sum of the uniform fees per acre-foot established pursuant to subsection F of this section for each year since the later of:

(a) The first full year following the year of the director's determination that the district's most recent plan of operation is consistent with achieving the management goals of the active management areas pursuant to section 45-576.03, subsection M.

(b) The year in which the service area qualified as a member service area pursuant to section 48-3780.

2. Interest on the amount established in paragraph 1 of this subsection calculated at an interest rate determined by the district.

3. The amounts established in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection multiplied by ten per cent.

H. The annual membership dues become an obligation of each municipal provider that has a member service area and shall be stated, collected and enforced with respect to the municipal provider in the same manner as the annual replenishment tax pursuant to sections 48-3781 and 48-3782.

I. Annual membership dues collected by the district shall be deposited in a special fund established by the state to be spent by the district only for the purposes authorized by this article, including:

1. The payment of debt service expenses and funding reserves for bonds issued for replenishment purposes.

2. The payment of the costs of acquiring, leasing or exchanging water or water rights and development of infrastructure necessary for the district to perform its replenishment obligations.

J. Amounts collected may be transferred to a bank or trust company to be held in trust and spent with respect to bonds issued for replenishment purposes.

The recorded notice and claim of lien are prima facie evidence of the truth of all recited matters and the regularity of all proceedings before recording the lien.

As a provisional remedy in any such action, the district may seek an attachment against the property of any such defendant district member or the appointment of a receiver to collect revenues generated directly or indirectly to that district member from water produced for use by that member, or both an attachment and the appointment of a receiver. Before applying to the court for an order of attachment or the appointment of a receiver, the district shall mail notice to the district member stating the amount of the delinquency and the reason and remedy or remedies to be sought by the district. The district shall recover its costs and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, court costs and costs incurred in executing the attachment or for the receiver.

D. Any person who violates this chapter by knowingly, and with intent to evade the provisions of this chapter, filing with the district any false or fraudulent information in a report that is required by the district pursuant to section 48-4572 is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor.

A. For purposes of financing its planning and the construction of its preliminary phase of improvements as prescribed by section 48-6006, subsection A, paragraph 9, the district board, by resolution and pursuant to the procedures as the district board provides, may levy an assessment of the costs of any public purpose, any operation and maintenance of the district or any enhanced services on any land in the district based on the benefit determined by the district board to be received by the land. Before the issuance of special assessment bonds, the district may enter into a written agreement with a landowner as to the manner in which the assessment is to be allocated if the land is to be divided into more than one parcel.  If an issue of special assessment lien bonds finances more than one purpose or service, the benefit received by the land, in the discretion of the district, may be determined by reference to the purposes and services as a whole or individually.  The assessment may be based on estimated costs and amended to reflect actual costs, and the preparation of plans and specifications and the awarding of the contract are not a prerequisite to the levying of the assessment.  An owner of land on which an assessment has been levied may seek judicial review of whether the land is benefited by the proposed infrastructure, on the merits, by special action filed with the court of appeals within thirty days of the effective date of the resolution.

B. After adoption by the district board of a resolution levying a special assessment on property in the district, the district board may issue and sell special assessment lien bonds payable from amounts collected from the special assessments, from amounts available in any reserve fund established for those bonds and from any other amounts available for those purposes as prescribed by law.  The district board may also issue and sell bond anticipation notes.  The assessment shall be a first lien on the property assessed subject only to general property taxes and prior special assessments.  In the event of nonpayment of an assessment, the procedures for collection of delinquent assessments, sale of delinquent property and issuance and effect of the deed prescribed by sections 48-601 through 48-607 apply, as nearly as practicable, except that the district is not required to purchase the delinquent land at the sale if there is no other purchaser.  If the landowner owns more than one parcel in the district, the district board may provide procedures for the collection and enforcement of assessments as the board deems appropriate by contract with a landowner to permit the sale of any or all of the landowner's parcels in the district if the landowner becomes delinquent as to any parcel that the landowner owns in the district.

C. On adoption of the resolution, but before issuance of the special assessment lien bonds, the district may direct the treasurer to make demand on the owners of the property so assessed, as shown on the property tax roll, for advance payment of the amount assessed.  The demand shall state a date not less than twenty days after the date of adoption of the demand after which the treasurer may refuse to accept advance payments of the assessment. The treasurer shall certify to the clerk on or after the date specified in the demand the amount collected and the assessments remaining unpaid against each parcel of land assessed.  Special assessment lien bonds may not be issued in an amount in excess of the amount assessed in the demand or, if advance payments are demanded, the amount certified to the clerk.  The district may adopt procedures for prepayment and provisions for payment and reallocation of assessments.

D. The district may issue and sell refunding bonds to refund any special assessment bonds of the district.

#### Section 48-6022. Terms of bonds

With respect to any bonds, the district board shall prescribe the denominations of the bonds, the size of each issue and the form of the bonds and shall establish the maturities, interest payment dates and interest rates, whether fixed or variable, not exceeding the maximum rate stated in the notice of the election or the resolution of the district board. The bonds may be sold by competitive bid or negotiated sale for public or private offering at, below or above par.  If the bonds are sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount and interest to be paid on the bonds shall not exceed the amount of interest which would have been payable on those bonds pursuant to the maturity schedule prescribed by the district board at the maximum rate set out in the bond resolution.  The proceeds of the sales shall be deposited with the treasurer, or with a trustee or agent designated by the district board, to the credit of the district to be withdrawn for the purposes provided by this article.  Pending that use, the proceeds may be invested as determined by the district.  The bonds may contain such terms, conditions, covenants and agreements as the district board deems proper. The bonds may be payable from any combination of revenues or special assessments of the district on real property and as specified in the bonds provided that all applicable requirements of those sections are met.

#### Section 48-6023. Annual financial estimate and budget

The district board shall make annual statements and estimates of the operation and maintenance expenses of the district, the costs of capital improvements to be financed by the district and the amount of all other expenditures for district purposes and enhanced services proposed to be paid from assessments.  The district board shall file the annual statements and estimates with the clerk.  The district board shall publish a notice of the filing of the estimate, shall hold hearings on the estimate and shall adopt a budget.  The board, on or before the date set by law for certifying the annual budget of the county, shall fix, levy and assess the amounts to be raised by assessments of the district and shall cause certified copies of the order to be delivered to the board of supervisors.  All statutes relating to the levy and collection of assessments and sale of property for nonpayment of assessments apply to the district assessments provided for by this section.

B. The legislature further finds that maintaining the mission of Fort Huachuca will strengthen our national defense and ensure and improve the public safety of the residents of this state, and that the closure or significant reduction in the fort's mission would adversely impact the safety and security of the residents of this state and this nation. Because federal law requires consideration of certain water issues in evaluating the future of Fort Huachuca, ensuring the water supply to Fort Huachuca and its surrounding communities will further protect the public's safety.

C. The purpose of this chapter is to allow for the formation of the upper San Pedro water district consisting of a portion of the upper San Pedro groundwater basin that includes Fort Huachuca, the lands in the corporate limits of the cities of Sierra Vista and Tombstone and the town of Huachuca City and the portion of the city of Bisbee located in the upper San Pedro groundwater basin, but not any lands in Santa Cruz county or Pima county and not including that portion of the city of Bisbee located in the Douglas groundwater basin, and to provide the district with sufficient resources and authority to allow the district to achieve the goal prescribed in section 48-6403.

D. The upper San Pedro water district formed pursuant to this chapter is intended as a long-term, legally binding body with perpetual authority that is specifically adapted to the geographical and hydrological requirements and needs of the area in the district.  The district shall be established with a specific water resource goal appropriate to that area.

E. The legislature finds that the adequate water supply requirements in section 48-6411 are necessary to assist the district in achieving its management goal and to protect the public health and safety in the district.

At the conclusion of the budget hearing, the district board, by resolution, shall adopt the budget as finally approved by the board. The budget shall be adopted before October 1 each year.

 

#### Section 48-6814. Revenue bonds; fees and charges

A. At any time after the hearing on formation of the district, the district board may hold a hearing on the question of authorizing the district board to issue revenue bonds of the district to provide monies for any infrastructure purposes consistent with the general plan.

B. If revenue bonds are approved by resolution, the district board may issue and sell revenue bonds of the district.

E.

The establishment or revision of any rates, fees and charges shall be identified and noticed concurrently with the annual budget process of the district pursuant to section 48-6813.

F. If, in the resolution of the district board, the revenues to be pledged were limited to certain types of revenues, only those types of revenues may be pledged and only those revenues must be maintained.

G. No holder of revenue bonds issued under this article may compel any exercise of the taxing power of the district or municipality to pay the bonds or the interest on the bonds. Revenue bonds issued under this article are not a debt of the district or municipality, nor is the payment of revenue bonds enforceable out of any monies other than the revenue pledged to the payment of the bonds.

H. The district may issue and sell refunding bonds to refund any revenue bonds of the district.

 

#### Section 48-6815. Special assessments; assessment lien bonds

A. The district board, after approval of the assessment at an election held as prescribed by section 48-6818, and pursuant to the procedures prescribed by sections 48-576 through 48-589, as nearly as practicable, or such other procedures as the district board provides, may levy by resolution an assessment of the costs of any infrastructure purpose, any operation and maintenance of infrastructure or any enhanced municipal services on any land in the district based on the benefit determined by the district board to be received by the land.  Before the issuance of special assessment bonds the district may enter into a written agreement with a landowner as to the manner in which the assessment is to be allocated if the land is to be divided into more than one parcel.  If an issue of special assessment lien bonds finances more than one purpose or service, the benefit received by the land, in the discretion of the district, may be determined by reference to the purposes and services as a whole or individually. The assessment may be based on estimated costs and amended to reflect actual costs, and the preparation of plans and specifications and the awarding of the contract are not a prerequisite to the levying of the assessment. An owner of land on which an assessment has been levied may seek judicial review of whether the land is benefited by the proposed infrastructure, on the merits, by special action filed with the court of appeals, within thirty days of the effective date of the resolution.

B. After adoption by the district board of a resolution levying a special assessment on property in the district, the district board may issue and sell special assessment lien bonds payable from amounts collected from the special assessments, from amounts available from time to time in any reserve fund established for those bonds and from any other amounts available for those purposes as prescribed by section 48-6812. The district and the county treasurer for the county in which the district is located may enter into an agreement for the county treasurer to collect the district's special assessments in the manner and by the officers provided by law for the collection and enforcement of general taxes. The district and the county treasurer may provide by agreement for the payment of the county treasurer's collection expenses directly related to the levy of the special assessment and, if so provided, the levy of the special assessment may include an amount for compensation of the county treasurer directly related to the collection of the special assessment.  The compensation received by the county treasurer pursuant to the agreement shall be governed by section 11-496. The district board may also issue and sell bond anticipation notes pursuant to the procedures prescribed in section 48-2081 or with procedures as similar to those as is practicable. The assessment shall be a first lien on the property assessed subject only to general property taxes and prior special assessments. In the event of nonpayment of an assessment and except as otherwise provided in an agreement between the district and the county treasurer pursuant to this section, the procedures for collection of delinquent assessments, sale of delinquent property and issuance and effect of the deed prescribed by sections 48-601 through 48-607 apply, as nearly as practicable, except that in no event is the district or the municipality required to purchase the delinquent land at the sale if there is no other purchaser.  If the landowner owns more than one parcel in the district, the district board may provide procedures for the collection and enforcement of assessments as the board deems appropriate by contract with a landowner to permit the sale of any or all of the landowner's parcels in the district if the landowner becomes delinquent as to any parcel that the landowner owns in the district.

C. On adoption of the resolution, but before issuance of the special assessment lien bonds, the district may direct the treasurer to make demand on the owners of the property so assessed, as shown on the property tax roll, for advance payment of the amount assessed.  The demand shall state a date not less than twenty days after the date of adoption of the resolution after which the treasurer may refuse to accept advance payments of the assessment. The treasurer shall certify to the clerk on or after the date specified in the demand the amount collected and the assessments remaining unpaid against each parcel of land assessed.  Special assessment lien bonds may not be issued in an amount in excess of the amount assessed in the resolution or, if advance payments are demanded, the amount certified to the clerk. The district may adopt procedures for prepayment and provisions for payment and reallocation of assessments.

D. The district may issue and sell refunding bonds to refund any special assessment bonds of the district.

 

#### Section 48-6816. Terms of bonds

With respect to any bonds the district board shall prescribe the denominations of the bonds, the size of each issue and the form of the bonds and shall establish the maturities, interest payment dates and interest rates, whether fixed or variable, not exceeding the maximum rate stated in the notice of the election or the resolution of the district board. The bonds may be sold by competitive bid or negotiated sale for public or private offering at, below or above par. If the bonds are sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount and interest to be paid on the bonds shall not exceed the amount of interest that would have been payable on those bonds pursuant to the maturity schedule prescribed by the district board at the maximum rate set out in the bond resolution.  The proceeds of the sales shall be deposited with the treasurer, or with a trustee or agent designated by the district board, to the credit of the district to be withdrawn for the purposes provided by this article.  Pending that use, the proceeds may be invested as determined by the district.  The bonds may contain such terms, conditions, covenants and agreements as the district board deems proper. The bonds may be payable from any combination of revenues or special assessments of the types described in this article and as specified in the bonds if all applicable requirements are met.

 

#### Section 48-6817. District taxes; annual financial estimate and budget

A. At any time after the hearing on formation of the district, the district board, or, if before formation, the governing body, may call an election to submit to the persons who are eligible to vote in the district as prescribed in section 48-6818 and the qualified electors of the district the question of authorizing the district board to levy an ad valorem tax on the assessed value of all the real and personal property in the district at a rate or rates that do not exceed the maximum rate or rates specified in the ballot. All taxes shall be used for the operation and maintenance expenses of the district, excluding expenses for an area described in section 48-6808, subsection E, and shall not exceed an amount equal to thirty cents per one hundred dollars of assessed valuation for all real and personal property in the district, unless a higher rate is approved by a petition signed by the owners of at least fifty-one per cent of the net assessed value of the property of the district and a petition signed by at least fifty-one per cent of the property owners of the district. The district board by simple majority vote may reduce or eliminate any portion of the tax imposed by the district.

B. The district may not levy at a rate or rates in excess of the maximum rate then in effect.

C. When levying an ad valorem tax, the district board shall make annual statements and estimates of the operation and maintenance expenses of the district and the amount of all other expenditures for infrastructure and enhanced municipal services proposed to be paid from the tax levy or levies, all of which shall be provided for by the levy and collection of ad valorem taxes on the assessed value of all the real and personal property in the district.  The district board shall file the annual statements and estimates with the clerk. The district board shall publish a notice of the filing of the estimate, shall hold hearings on the portions of the estimate not relating to debt service on bonds and shall adopt a budget. The board, on or before the date set by law for certifying the annual budget of the county or municipality, shall fix, levy and assess the amounts to be raised by ad valorem taxes of the district and shall cause certified copies of the order to be delivered to the board of supervisors and to the department of revenue. All statutes relating to the levy and collection of general county taxes, including the collection of delinquent taxes and sale of property for nonpayment of taxes, apply to the district taxes provided for by this section.

 

#### Section 48-6818. Notice and conduct of elections; eligible voters

A. Any election under this article shall be a nonpartisan election called by posting notices in three public places within the boundaries of the district not less than twenty days before the election. Any election may be conducted as a mail ballot election in the manner prescribed in title 16, chapter 4, article 8.1 as nearly as practicable.  If the election notice is not mailed to the property owners and, if applicable, to the qualified electors, the notice shall also be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the municipality or if there is no newspaper so circulated in the municipality in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the municipality is located once a week for two consecutive weeks before the election. The notice shall state:

1. The place of holding the election.

2. The hours during the day, not less than six, in which the polls will be open.

3. If it is an assessment levy election, the maximum assessment rate to be imposed, the purposes for which the monies raised will be used and the existing maximum assessment rate, if any.

4. That a general plan is on file with the clerk.

B. The district board shall determine the date of the election and, if applicable, the polling places for the election and may consolidate precincts. The clerk of the district board shall prepare a list of eligible voters in the election. A prospective landowner voter shall execute an affidavit stating that the voter is the owner of land in the district and is qualified to vote pursuant to this section and stating the parcel number owned by the voter.  Election board members may administer oaths or take all affirmations for these purposes.  An election held pursuant to this article is not subject to title 16, chapter 2, article 3.

C. Only the owners of real property in the district are eligible to vote in an election regarding an assessment to be levied against the real property in the district, in an election for the board of directors of the district and in an election for dissolution.  Corporations, partnerships and other business entities are eligible to vote as property owners, but only one vote may be cast for each one-seventh of an acre of real property in the district, except that any fraction of ownership of real property that is less than one-seventh of an acre entitles the owner to cast one vote.  A majority of the acreage as represented by the votes cast at an election conducted solely under the acreage system shall determine the result. An acreage system election shall be conducted pursuant to the procedures prescribed in sections 48-3042 through 48-3051 as nearly as practicable.

D. Except as otherwise provided by this article, the election shall comply with the general election laws of this state, except that the words to appear on the ballots shall be for an assessment levy election, "assessment, yes" and "assessment, no".  The returns of election shall be made to the district board.

E. Within fourteen days after an election, the district board shall meet and canvass the returns. In the case of an ad valorem tax election, if a majority of the votes cast by qualified electors at the election is in favor and the majority of acreage as represented by the votes cast at the election is in favor of imposing the tax, the district board shall enter that fact on its minutes.  In the case of a landowner election only, the result of the measure shall be determined by a majority of the acreage represented by the votes cast at an election, and the district board shall enter that fact on its minutes.  The canvass may be continued from time to time. Failure of a majority to vote in favor of the matter submitted does not prejudice the submission of the same or similar matters at a later election.

F. If a person listed on the assessment roll is no longer the owner of land in the district and the name of the successor owner becomes known and is verified by recorded deed or other similar evidence of transfer of ownership, the successor owner is deemed to be the owner for the purposes of this article.

 

#### Section 48-6819. Dissolution of district

A. The district may be dissolved by the district board by a resolution of the district board if the following conditions exist:

1. All of the real and personal property owned by the district has been or will be conveyed to a municipality.

2. Either the district has no bonds or obligations or the municipality has assumed all of the obligations of the district.

B. The district board shall comply with the conditions prescribed by subsection A and shall dissolve the district if both of the following occur:

1. The governing body has consented to comply with the conditions prescribed by subsection A and either:

E. All property in the district, except federal, state, county and municipal property, remains subject to the lien for the payment of ad valorem taxes levied, and any property subject to a special assessment lien remains subject to the lien notwithstanding dissolution of the district. The district may not be dissolved if any revenue or assessment bonds of the district remain outstanding unless an amount of money sufficient, together with investment income thereon, to make all payments due on the revenue bonds either at maturity or prior redemption has been deposited with a trustee or escrow agent and pledged to the payment and redemption of the bonds. The district may continue to operate after dissolution only as needed to collect money and make payments on any outstanding bonds.

F. If a proposal for dissolution is approved and the district is an Arizona state retirement system employer before the dissolution, the governing body of the district shall notify the director of the Arizona state retirement system of the dissolution.
