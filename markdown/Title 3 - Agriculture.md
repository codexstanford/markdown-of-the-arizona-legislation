#### Section 3-902. Administration and enforcement

The director shall administer and oversee the enforcement of this chapter.

#### Section 3-903. Protected group of plants; botanical names govern; categories of protected plants; power to add or remove plants; annual hearing

A. The protected group of native plants shall include, and protected native plants shall be, any plant or part of a plant, except, unless otherwise specifically included, its seeds or fruit, which is growing wild on state land or public land or on privately owned land without being propagated or cultivated by human beings and which is included by the director on any of the definitive lists of protected categories of protected native plants described in this section. The director by definitive lists may divide any protected category into subcategories which are to receive different treatment under the rules adopted under this article to conserve or protect such plants. In the preparation of each list of plants within a protected category or subcategory the director shall list by botanical names all of those protected plants which are to fall within the protection of that category or subcategory. The botanical names of the listed plants govern in all cases in the interpretation of this article and any rules adopted under this article.

B. The director shall establish by rule the lists of plants in the following categories of protected native plants:

1. Highly safeguarded native plants to be afforded the exclusive protections, including the use of scientific or threatened collection and salvage permits, provided this category in this chapter. This category includes those species of native plants and parts of plants, including the seeds and fruit, whose prospects for survival in this state are in jeopardy or which are in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges, and those native plants which are likely within the foreseeable future to become jeopardized or in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of their ranges. This category also includes those plants resident to this state and listed as endangered, threatened, or category 1 in the federal endangered species act of 1973 (P.L. 93-205; 87 Stat. 884; 16 United States Code sections 1531 et seq.), as amended, and any regulations adopted under that act.

2. Salvage restricted native plants to be afforded the exclusive protections involving the use of salvage permits, tags and seals provided in this chapter. This category includes those native plants which are not included in the highly safeguarded category but are nevertheless subject to a high potential for damage by theft or vandalism.

3. Salvage assessed native plants to be afforded the exclusive protections, involving the use of salvage tags and seals and annual salvage permits, provided in this chapter. This category includes those native plants which are not included in either the highly safeguarded or salvage restricted categories but nevertheless have a sufficient value if salvaged to support the cost of salvage tags and seals.

4. Harvest restricted native plants to be afforded the exclusive protections involving the use of harvest permits and wood receipts provided in this chapter. This category includes those native plants which are not included in the highly safeguarded category but are subject to excessive harvesting or overcutting because of the intrinsic value of their by-products, fiber or woody parts.

C. The director by rule may add or remove a native plant to or from the protected group or any of the categories of protected native plants.

D. The director shall hold a public hearing on native plants at least every twelve months after giving notice as required by section 3-912, subsection B.

The department shall post and disseminate copies of the notice as provided in section 3-904, subsection E. This state and its agencies and political subdivisions are exempt from any fees established for salvaged plants.

B. If the director determines that the proposed action by the state agency may affect a highly safeguarded plant, he shall consult with the state agency and other appropriate parties and use the best scientific data available to issue a written finding as to whether the proposed action would appreciably reduce the likelihood of survival or recovery of the plant taxon in this state. If the determination is affirmative, the director shall also specify reasonable, prudent and distinct alternatives to the proposed project that can be implemented and are consistent with conserving the plant taxon.

C. The director shall adopt rules for the disposal and salvage of native plants subject to removal or destruction by a state agency either under permit to other government agencies or nonprofit organizations or sale to the general public or commercial dealers. The department may issue permits to donate, sell, salvage or harvest the plants after the it ascertains the validity of the request and determines the kinds and approximate number of the plants involved. The permit shall specify the number and species of protected native plants and the area from which they may be taken.

#### Section 3-906. Collection and salvage of protected plants; procedures, permits, tags and seals; duration; exception

A. Except as provided in this chapter a person shall not take, transport or possess any protected native plant taken from the original growing site in this state without possessing a valid permit issued by the division.  The division shall issue permits in either a name or business name.  A permit to take, transport or possess native plants is nontransferable, except that a permittee, by subcontract or otherwise, may allow its agents to work under the permit if the permittee remains primarily responsible for the actions of persons acting under his expressed or implied authority.

B. In addition to the requirements prescribed by this section, a person who moves or salvages a saguaro cactus (cereus giganteus) that is more than four feet tall, from other than its original growing location, must purchase a permit, tag and seal from the department.  A person may move a saguaro cactus without obtaining a permit, tag and seal only if the person maintains documentation of a previous legal movement or if the department has record of a previous legal movement of the cactus by the person.  Saguaro cacti that are propagated by humans are exempt from the requirements of this subsection.

C. Permits applicable to highly safeguarded native plants may be issued only for collection for scientific purposes or for the noncommercial salvage of highly safeguarded native plants whose existence is threatened by intended destruction, or by their location or by a change in land usage, and if the permit may enhance the survival of the affected species.

D. Permits issued for the salvage of salvage assessed native plants shall be issued for a period of one calendar year without respect to the land from which the plants will later be taken.  The associated tags and seals shall be issued individually or in bulk on payment of any fees required under section 3-913, subsection A, without respect to the specific plants for which they will be used.  All such tags and seals remain valid for use in subsequent years as long as the permit is renewed.

E. The division shall provide tags and seals for each permit issued for taking, transporting or possessing highly safeguarded, salvage restricted or salvage assessed native plants.  The director by rule shall establish procedures and forms for permits, tags and seals to be issued for the collection and salvage of highly safeguarded native plants and the salvage of salvage restricted and salvage assessed native plants.  The director by rule may establish and modify the form and character of the tags and seals described in this section.  All such tags and seals shall be attached to the plants at the time of taking and before transporting.  It is unlawful to remove a tag or seal from a protected native plant that has been taken and tagged pursuant to this article before the plant has been transplanted at its designated site.  A tag or seal may be removed only by a designated agent of the division or by the owner of the plant.

F. This section does not apply to the transporting of protected native plants by a landowner or his agent from one of his properties to another if the plants are not offered for sale.

Unless the survey is limited to the simple determination of whether or not protected species exist on the land, the department may collect fees as reimbursement for the services which are reasonably based on the time factor, vegetation density and acreage.  Notwithstanding section 35-148, subsection A, the director shall deposit any monies received under this subsection in the fund established by section 3-913.

B. The director by rule may require written reports from persons engaged in salvaging or harvesting protected native plants as to the location and quantities of protected native plants and their parts which have been salvaged or harvested under this chapter.  The director by rule may make the filing of these reports a condition to the issuance or renewal of any permits, tags, seals or receipts provided for in this chapter.

C. The department may conduct investigations of the status of all species of native plants in order to develop information relative to population distribution, habitat needs, limiting factors and other biological data and to determine measures and requirements, including transplantation and propagation, necessary for their conservation or survival. If protected native plants or significant communities of such plants are vulnerable to depletion from their collection or harvest as a commercial resource, the department may collect statistical information and conduct investigations to determine what harvests are sustainable without depleting the plants or plant communities or destroying significant habitat provided by such plants or plant communities.

D. The director may appoint, utilize and contract with a technical advisory board, serving without compensation, to annually review the number of permits and tags issued in order to assess whether plant species, communities or populations are being depleted and recommend revisions to the protected plant categories.  The board shall consist of representatives of the scientific community, including the botanical and zoological fields, and representatives from the native plant industries, including salvage, revegetation, propagation, landscaping and harvesting concerns.

 

#### Section 3-911. Conservation and public education

A. The department may conserve the highly safeguarded native plants including the use, and encouraging the use, of all methods and procedures that are necessary to bring the highly safeguarded native plants to the point where they are no longer in need of federal protection as endangered or threatened plants or state protection as highly safeguarded native plants.  These methods and procedures include all activities associated with scientific resource management such as research, census, law enforcement, habitat protection and maintenance, propagation and transplantation.

B. The department shall encourage commercial businesses engaged in land development or other activities conducted on private land to salvage protected native plants to the greatest extent feasible.

#### Section 3-3631. Termite action report form; exemption

Within thirty calendar days after completion of a pretreatment, a new-construction treatment, a final grade treatment, an initial corrective treatment or a wood-destroying insect inspection report, a business licensee or certified applicator shall file with the division in a form approved by the director a termite action report form and the prescribed fee.  A termite action report is required for termite action only and does not include all wood-destroying organisms.

B. The termite action report form shall include:

1. The address or location of the work or project.

2. The type and date of the work.

3. The name of the business licensee.

4. Any other information required by rule.

#### Section 3-3632. Wood-destroying organisms; treatment proposal; form; retention; exception

A. A business licensee shall not commence work on a contract or sign, issue or deliver any documents expressing an opinion or making a statement relating to the presence or absence of wood-destroying organisms in a structure until an inspection is made.

B. Only an applicator certified in the category of wood-destroying organism management shall prepare a treatment proposal on a form approved by the director. The applicator shall deliver a copy of the treatment proposal to the person requesting the proposal or treatment, or the person's designated agent, before beginning treatment.  The treatment proposal shall include the following information:

1. The address of the property to be treated.

2. A statement describing that the work is preventative or corrective.

3. A statement describing the evidence of infestation or damage.

4. A diagrammatic description showing the nature and location of evidence of infestation or damage, or both, if applicable.

5. A statement describing the treatment or repair method, including the name of the pesticide or device to be used and a diagrammatic description showing where the treatment or repair will be rendered.

6. The price for the work.

7. The terms for the service agreement provided by the business licensee.

8. The signature and license number of the person who made the inspection of the structure to be treated.

C. A certified applicator shall also give to the person requesting a proposal or treatment a written recommendation that verifies a particular problem and, in addition to the certified applicator's recommendation for treatment, shall advise the person of alternative treatments and methods, including integrated pest management methods, to alleviate the problem.

D. A treatment proposal shall not be in the same form or be construed as a wood-destroying insect inspection report. A treatment proposal that does not identify infestation by wood-destroying organisms is not a binding statement as to the presence or absence of wood-destroying organisms.

E. A treatment proposal shall be prepared by a certified applicator who has received at least five hours of instruction from an in-house education program of the business licensee on the subject of wood-destroying organisms inspections. An examination on the instruction is not required. The business licensee shall keep a record of completion of the training and shall make the record available on the director's request.  The instruction requirement does not apply to certified qualified applicators.

F. If a business licensee performs a treatment pursuant to a treatment proposal, the business licensee shall maintain for three years a record of the treatment and the name and quantity of the pesticide used.

G. This section does not apply to the application of pesticides directly to structural components of wood or wood products, which are not part of an existing structure normally habitable by persons, to prevent or manage wood degradation by wood-destroying organisms.

#### Section 3-3633. Wood-destroying insect inspection reports

A. Wood-destroying insect inspection reports may be completed only by an applicator who is certified in the category of wood-destroying organism management and who has received at least five hours of instruction from an in-house education program of the business licensee on the subject of wood-destroying insect inspection reports. An examination on the instruction is not required.  The business licensee shall keep a record of completion of the training and shall make the record available on the director's request.  The instruction requirement does not apply to certified qualified applicators.

B. Wood-destroying insect inspection reports shall be on file in the office of the business licensee within seven calendar days after the completion of an inspection. The business licensee shall retain a copy of all completed wood-destroying insect inspection reports for three years and make the reports available on the director's request.

C. Wood-destroying insect inspection reports are evidence of both the existence or absence of wood-destroying insects and conditions conducive to wood-destroying insects that were visible and accessible to an inspector at the time the inspection was made. A business licensee remains responsible for the accuracy of the inspection and the report as evidence of the presence or absence of infestation and conditions conducive to infestation on the date of inspection, except that a wood-destroying insect inspection report shall not be construed as a guarantee as to the presence or absence of wood-destroying insects and conditions conducive to wood-destroying insects in a structure after the date of inspection.

D. If a certified applicator is exempt from the business license requirement with respect to wood-destroying insect inspections pursuant to rules established by the director, the certified applicator shall fulfill the responsibilities placed on business licensees in this section.

E. A person shall not complete a wood-destroying insect inspection report for a property that the person owns or occupies.
