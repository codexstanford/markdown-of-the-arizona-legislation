A claim maintenance fee of _________________________ dollars was paid by or at the expense of ___________________________, owners of the claim, instead of recording an affidavit of annual work for the purpose of complying with the laws of the United States and holding the claim. (Here add signature and verification.)

D. The affidavit of annual work or the affidavit of claim maintenance fee payment when recorded shall be prima facie evidence of the performance of the labor or improvements or of claim maintenance fee payment.  Any affidavit shall include, if known to the locator, the identification of the section, township and range in which the notice of location of the claim is posted.

E. When annual work or improvements or claim maintenance fee payment is done on one or more of a contiguous group of claims for the benefit of all, or wholly or partly outside of a contiguous group of claims for the benefit of all, all claims may be included in a single affidavit.

F. For each separate affidavit of annual work or affidavit of claim maintenance fee payment recorded, the county recorder, by the tenth day of each month, shall forward to the state treasurer for deposit in the state general fund four dollars of each total fee collected pursuant to section 11-475 during the previous month.

#### Section 27-209. Sufficiency of description of mining claims

In all actions, judgments, grants, or conveyances it shall be a sufficient description of a mining claim if the name of the claim, the district, county and state where it is located, and the book and page where the location notice thereof is recorded can be understood therefrom.

#### Section 27-210. Existing claims

A. The owner of an unpatented lode, placer or millsite claim existing on the effective date of this section may on or before October 21, 1980, file a map, plat or sketch of such claim conforming to the requirements of section 27-203, subsections B and C which shall also recite the book and page of recording of the location notice and any amendments to the location notice. The owner of a group of claims may file a single plat or map for any claims having the point of posting of the location notice within the same section of the public land survey system.

B. The county recorder shall receive as fees fifty cents per claim for recording such a map, plat or sketch under this section and shall index such claims by the name of the claim in the index of claims by cadastral subdivisions of the United States bureau of land management or general land office.

C. The recording of a claim in compliance with this section shall constitute constructive notice to the public of the position of such claim after the date of recording and shall constitute a rebuttable presumption that the claim was monumented on the ground so that its boundaries could be readily traced.

### Article 2 - Rights of Co-Owners

#### Section 27-221. Notice to delinquent co-owner to contribute share of annual labor expense or maintenance fees

A. When a co-owner gives a delinquent co-owner notice in writing or notice by publication to contribute his proportion of the expense of annual labor or maintenance fees as provided by the laws of the United States, an affidavit of the person giving the notice, stating the time, place, manner of service and by whom and upon whom the service was made, shall be attached to a true copy of the notice, and the notice and affidavit shall be recorded ninety days after giving the notice, or if the notice is given by publication in a newspaper, there shall be attached to a printed copy of the notice an affidavit of the editor or publisher of the paper, stating the date of each insertion of the notice therein, and when and where the newspaper was published during that time, and the affidavit and notice shall be recorded one hundred and eighty days after the first publication.

B. A true copy of the original notice and affidavit of service, or the records thereof, shall be prima facie evidence that the delinquent co-owner has failed or refused to contribute his proportion of the expenditure, and shall be prima facie evidence of service or publication of the notice, unless the writing or affidavit provided for in section 27-222 is of record.

 

#### Section 27-222. Acknowledgment of contribution by delinquent co-owner

A. If the delinquent co-owner, within the time required by the laws of the United States, contributes his proportion of the expenditures, the co-owner, who demanded contribution shall sign and deliver to the delinquent co-owner a written statement that the delinquent, naming him, has, within the time required, contributed his share of the expense for the year upon the claim, and further stating the district, county and state wherein the claim is located and the recording information where the location notice is recorded. The statement shall be recorded.

B. If the co-owner who demanded contribution fails to sign and deliver the statement to the delinquent co-owner within twenty days after contribution is made, he shall be liable to the delinquent for a penalty of one hundred dollars. The delinquent, with two disinterested persons having personal knowledge of the contribution, may make an affidavit setting forth the manner, amount, to whom and upon what mining claim or claims the contribution was made. The affidavit may be recorded, and shall be prima facie evidence of the contribution.

 

### Article 3 - Lease of State Lands for Mineral Claims

#### Section 27-231. Definition of mineral

In this article, unless the context otherwise requires, "mineral" means all metallic ore minerals and industrial minerals other than common variety minerals as defined in section 27-271.

#### Section 27-233. Preferred right to renew mineral lease; evaluation of geologic and economic evidence

A. Upon application to the state land commissioner, not less than thirty nor more than sixty days prior to the expiration of the lease, if the lessee of mineral lands is not delinquent in the payment of rental or royalty on the date of expiration of the lease, the lessee shall have a preferred right to renew the lease bearing even date with the expiration of the old lease for a term of twenty years. The commissioner may deny the renewal application for any reason listed in section 27-251, subsection B, paragraphs 1 through  5.

B. In determining whether the proposed mining activities would be in the best interest of the trust pursuant to section 27-251, subsection B, paragraph 2, the commissioner may require the lessee to provide geologic and economic evidence showing at least probable or indicated mineral resources, as that evidence is conventionally interpreted in the mineral industry. Evidence provided to the state land department under this subsection is a trade secret of the mineral industry and is confidential pursuant to section 27-274.

#### Section 27-234. Rent; royalty; appeal; interest; penalty; lien

A. Before issuing a mineral lease the state land commissioner shall establish the annual land rental for the mineral lease.  The rental shall be based on an appraisal of the land that, for purposes of establishing the rent, shall not include the contributory value of mining. The annual rental:

1. Shall be at least the average rental assessed per acre by the states of Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.  If a state assesses a range of rental rates rather than a single rental rate, the median of the range of rental rates assessed by that state shall be used in calculating the average under this paragraph.

2. Is payable in advance of executing the mineral lease agreement by the commissioner and at the beginning of each annual period thereafter.

B. In addition to the annual rental, a production royalty of at least two per cent is assessed against the gross value of all minerals produced and sold from the mineral lease.  Where processing is performed after the mineral is extracted, the mineral shall be deemed produced and sold when the concentrate or cathode results from that processing.  The royalty rate for each mineral lease shall be based on an appraisal of this state's interest as a lessor in the mineral and shall be established according to the appraisal standard prescribed by subsection C of this section.  The gross value shall be based on the monthly average price of the mineral as quoted by the mineral commodities market and industry trade journals as determined by the commissioner and specified in the lease.  If a mineral does not have a published price quotation, the gross value shall be based on an appraisal that establishes the fair market price of the mineral.  The royalty shall not be based on any hedging or price protection arrangements that may be entered into by the lessee and any of these arrangements shall not be considered in any appraisal that established the fair market price of the mineral.

C. The commissioner shall appraise this state's interest as a lessor in the mineral according to standard appraisal methodology and, to the extent feasible, shall base the appraisal on market royalty rates. The appraisal shall be completed in order to determine whether a royalty rate greater than two per cent of the gross value is required in order to obtain a fair market value for this state's interests as a lessor in the mineral.  The appraisal shall be completed before issuing a mineral lease, at the end of the first year of commercial production and again for each renewal of the lease. If, during the term of the lease, new minerals are produced and sold from the mineral lease, or changes in technology substantially affect the value of this state's interest as a lessor, the commissioner at that time may reappraise that interest and, if appropriate, adjust the royalty rate.

D. For mines existing on state lands on June 8, 1989, the royalty paid under this section shall not be less than the royalty which would have been paid under statutes in effect immediately before June 8, 1989.

E. The costs of all appraisals conducted under this section shall be assessed against the lessee and added to the amount due as rental under this section.

F. The department shall review all property tax assessment information relevant to the mineral lease. The department shall maintain that information on a confidential basis as prescribed by title 42, chapter 2, article 1.

G. Every mineral lease of state land shall require the lessee to make the following records available on an annual basis:

1. Itemized statements of mineral production.

2. Relevant tax records.

3. Additional relevant records pertinent to appraisal, compliance with the lease and mineral production deemed necessary by the commissioner.

H. The information obtained under subsection G, paragraph 2 of this section and any trade secrets are confidential.  For purposes of this subsection, trade secrets are information to which all of the following apply:

1. A person has taken reasonable measures to protect the information from disclosure and the person intends to continue to take those measures.

2. The information is not and has not been reasonably obtainable by legitimate means by other persons without the person's consent, other than by governmental entities and other than in discovery based on a showing of special need in a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding.

3. A statute does not specifically require disclosure of the information to the public.

4. The person has satisfactorily shown that disclosure of the information is likely to cause substantial harm to the person's competitive position.

I. Mineral lessees shall make monthly royalty payments based on the mineral production activity of the previous month.

J. Appeals of the appraisal decision of the commissioner may be taken pursuant to section 37-215 to the board of appeals, established by section 37-213, which shall affirm, modify or reverse the decision of the commissioner within one hundred eighty days.  Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, decisions of the board of appeals under this subsection are subject to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.  As a condition of the appeal, the lessee must continue to make all rental and royalty payments due based on the commissioner's final appraisal decision, and the court shall not stay the commissioner's decision, in whole or in part, pending a final disposition of the case.  The state shall segregate rents and royalties paid while an appeal is pending and shall not distribute such monies to the state general fund or to the trust beneficiaries until the appeal is completed.

K. If a lessee fails to pay rent or royalty, including appraisal costs under subsection C of this section, on or before the date the payment is due, the amount due accrues interest at the rate and in the manner determined pursuant to section 42-1123.  In addition, if it is determined that the failure to pay is not due to reasonable cause, a penalty of five per cent of the amount found to be remaining due shall be added to the rent or royalty for each month or fraction of a month elapsing between the due date and the date on which it is paid.  The total penalty shall not exceed one-third of the rent or royalty remaining due.  The penalty so added to the rent or royalty is due and payable on notice and demand from the commissioner.

L. If any rent, royalty, appraisal assessment, interest or penalty is not paid by the lessee when due, the unpaid amounts constitute a lien from the date the amounts become due on all property and rights to property that belong to the lessee and that are located on state land.

#### Section 27-235. Offering permits and leases at auction; terms of lease; financial security termination

A. The state land commissioner may offer mineral exploration permits or mineral leases at public auction, after advertising, for state lands on which a mineral exploration permit or mineral lease has been cancelled, terminated or not been renewed by the lessee or permittee, or may offer mineral exploration permits at public auction, after advertising, for state trust lands that have been closed by commissioner's order. The commissioner may establish by rule the procedure for conducting the auction, but bidding is limited to a cash bonus to be paid in full before the commissioner executes the permit or the lease documents. The land rental and royalty rate are not subject to bidding.

B. Every mineral lease of state lands shall be for a term of twenty years.

C. The lease shall confer the right:

1. To extract and ship minerals from the leased land located within planes drawn vertically downward through the exterior boundary lines of the leased land.

2. To use as much of the surface as required for purposes incident to mining.

3. Of ingress to and egress from other state lands, whether or not leased for purposes other than mining.

D. Every mineral lease of state lands shall provide for:

1. The development and use of the property according to the lessee's general mining plan approved by the commissioner.

2. The fencing of all shafts, exploration holes, adits, tunnels and other dangerous mine workings for the protection of public health and safety and livestock.

3. The construction of necessary improvements and installation of necessary machinery and equipment with the right to remove it upon expiration, termination or abandonment of the lease, if the lessee is not in default of the terms and conditions of the lease.

4. The right of the lessee and the lessee's assigns to transfer the lease.

5. Termination of the lease by the commissioner upon written notice specifically setting forth the default for which forfeiture is declared, and preserving the right to cure the default within a stated period of not less than thirty days.

E. If financial security is required under this subsection, it shall be in the form of a cash deposit, a certificate of deposit, a surety bond or any other form of financial assurance acceptable to the commissioner. On default, the commissioner may use the proceeds of the financial security for the purposes described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of this subsection. Financial security may be required in the following circumstances:

1. The commissioner may require financial security to guarantee the payment of all monies due under the lease as royalty to this state.

2. The commissioner shall require financial security in a reasonable amount to be fixed by the commissioner conditioned on the lessee's reclaiming the surface of the land described in the lease to a reasonable condition in accordance with the reclamation measures approved by the commissioner. The commissioner may enter into agreements pursuant to title 11, chapter 7, article 3 with the state mine inspector's office, the United States bureau of land management, the United States forest service and other agencies that manage public lands and take other appropriate measures to coordinate the review and approval of reclamation plans, including designating a lead agency for reclamation plan review and action. The commissioner shall avoid redundant, inconsistent or contradictory reclamation, inspection, administration, enforcement and financial assurance requirements unless such requirements are necessary as a result of the commissioner's trust obligations.

3. The commissioner shall require financial security conditioned on the lessee's prompt payment to the owner or lessee of the surface of the state land described in the lease, or across which the lessee exercises the right of ingress, for any loss to the owner or lessee from damage or destruction caused by the lessee or the lessee's agents or employees to grass, forage, crops or improvements on the land.

F. The lessee of any mineral lease who has met the applicable terms and conditions of the lease from the time of issuance to the time of termination, as determined by the commissioner, may terminate the lease at any time during its term by giving the commissioner thirty days' written notice of the termination.

 

#### Section 27-236. Suspension of royalty rights

The commissioner may, if he deems it in the interest of the state, subordinate the royalty rights of the state under this article, or suspend the operation thereof or of any lease executed under the provisions of this article, in favor of the United States or any agency thereof, for the purpose of facilitating extension of financial aid under the laws of the United States in the development or operation of any mine located upon state lands.

#### Section 27-237. Review by commissioner

All questions arising between a lessee and the commissioner under this article shall be subject to review as in other cases involving state lands, and the lessee's right to possess and operate the lease shall continue until the question is finally determined.

#### Section 27-238. Existing leases

Every mineral lease issued under this article and article 4 of this chapter which had not expired or been terminated by the department as of June 8, 1989 shall be in effect for the unexpired term for which it was granted. The state land commissioner shall set the rental and royalty according to the appraisal standards prescribed by section 27-234 for any mineral lease in effect on June 8, 1989 and that rental and royalty are effective as of December 10, 1987.

#### Section 27-239. Inspections, investigations and audits

A. The state land commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative may enter, and the lessee shall maintain access to, the state land held under a mineral lease at reasonable times to inspect the workings, improvements and other facilities used to extract or sever minerals or common variety minerals, as defined in section 27-271, from state lands.

B. The commissioner or the commissioner's authorized representative may enter at reasonable times to:

1. Obtain factual data or access to records pertinent to mineral production and required to be kept under the terms of the lease.

2. Otherwise ascertain compliance with law and the terms of the lease.

C. Inspections, investigations and audits under subsection A shall be on reasonable notice to the lessee unless reasonable grounds exist to believe that notice would frustrate the enforcement of law or the terms of the lease. The commissioner may, and if required by law shall, apply for and obtain warrants for entry and inspection.

D. The commissioner may require a lessee to appear at reasonable times and on reasonable notice at the commissioner's office and produce such records and information as are specified in the notice to determine compliance with the terms of the lease.

E. The commissioner shall provide to the lessee a written report of each inspection, investigation and audit under this section.

F. Tax records and trade secrets, as defined in section 23-401, obtained under this section are confidential.

### Article 4 - Mineral Exploration Permits and Mineral Leases

#### Section 27-251. Application for mineral exploration permit

A. Any natural person over eighteen years of age and any other person qualified to transact business in this state may apply to the state land commissioner for a mineral exploration permit on the state land in one or more of the rectangular subdivisions of twenty acres, more or less, or lots, in any one section of the public land survey. Such application shall be in writing and signed by the applicant, or an authorized agent or attorney for the applicant, and shall contain the name and address of the applicant, a description according to the public land survey of the state land for which the applicant seeks a mineral exploration permit, and such other information as the commissioner may prescribe by rule. The application shall be filed with the state land department and shall be accompanied by payment to the department of a filing fee as prescribed pursuant to section 37-107. Each application meeting the requirements of this section shall be stamped by the department with the time and date it is filed with the department. The application shall have priority over any other application for a mineral exploration permit involving the same state land which may be filed with the department subsequent to such time and date, and such land shall be deemed withdrawn as long as the application is pending.

B. Not less than thirty days nor more than forty-five days from the filing of the application with the department, provided there is no prior application for a mineral exploration permit involving the same state land then pending before the department, or if such prior application is then pending but is subsequently cancelled, not more than thirty days after it is cancelled, the department shall mail to the applicant at the address shown on the application a written notice designating the state land that is described in the application and that, at the time the application was filed with the department, was open to application, the amount of rental required to be paid for the mineral exploration permit as herein provided, and whether a bond will be required under the provisions of section 27-255 as a condition to issuance of such permit. If, within thirty days after the mailing of such notice, the applicant pays to the department as rental for the permit the amount of two dollars per acre for each acre of state land designated in the notice and files with the department the bond, if any, required under section 27-255, and if the commissioner finds that issuing the permit is in the best interest of the trust, the commissioner shall issue to the applicant a mineral exploration permit for the state land designated in the notice. The commissioner may deny the application for any of the following reasons:

1. The application was not made in good faith.

2. The proposed exploration or possible future mining activities would not be the highest and best use of the trust lands.

3. The value and income potential of surrounding trust lands would be adversely affected and the benefit from proposed exploration and future mining activity cannot reasonably be expected to be greater than the diminished value to those surrounding trust lands.

4. The proposed operations would violate applicable state or federal law.

5. The commissioner determines that the proposed exploration activities or possible future mining activities will create a liability to the state greater than the income from the proposed operations.

C. During the period such mineral exploration permit is in effect no person except the permittee and the authorized agents and employees of the permittee shall be entitled to explore for minerals on the state land covered by the permit. If the applicant fails to make the payment or furnish the bond within the period of thirty days, the application shall be deemed cancelled and of no further effect.

 

#### Section 27-252. Terms of mineral exploration permit; definition

A. Every mineral exploration permit shall be for a term of one year from the date of issuance, subject to renewals as provided in this article for an aggregate of not to exceed five years from such date, and shall give to the permittee the rights, subject to the terms and conditions, as follows:

1. During the period the permit is in force and effect, the permittee shall have the exclusive right to explore for minerals within the state land covered by the permit and to apply for and obtain a mineral lease or leases to the land.

2. The permittee shall have those surface rights necessary for exploration for mineral on the state land covered by the permit, but may remove from the land only that amount of mineral required by the permittee for sampling, assay and metallurgical testing purposes.

3. The permittee shall have the right of ingress to and egress from the land covered by the permit across other state lands but only along routes first approved by the commissioner.

4. The permittee shall be liable to and shall compensate the owner and lessee of the surface of the state land covered by the permit, or across which the permittee exercises the right of ingress and egress, for any loss to such owner and lessee from damage or destruction caused by the permittee or the permittee's agents or employees to grasses, forage, crops or improvements upon such state land.

5. The permit shall terminate automatically as of the end of any annual period from and after the date of issuance unless during such annual period the permittee expended in exploration for valuable mineral deposits on the state land covered by the permit not less than the amount per acre provided in this article or paid to the department a sum equal thereto, and prior to expiration of such annual period shall have filed with the department an application for renewal for the ensuing annual period, and an affidavit showing such expenditure, together with such other proof in support thereof as the commissioner by rule may prescribe. The amount to be so expended or paid to the department during each of the first two annual periods in which such permit may be in effect shall be not less than ten dollars for each acre of state land covered by the permit at the commencement of such annual period, and the amount to be so expended or paid to the department during each of the last three annual periods in which such permit may be in effect shall be not less than twenty dollars for each acre of state land covered by the permit at the commencement of such annual period. Prior to termination of any such annual period, the permittee may, by instrument in writing filed with the department, release from the permit the acreage covered thereby and contained within one or more rectangular subdivisions of twenty acres, more or less, or lots, according to the lines of the public land surveys.

6. When a permittee has an interest in one or more contiguous properties for which he or she holds a mineral exploration permit, such permittee may group such permits and expend the sum required by this article under a common plan of development on one or more of the properties for the benefit of all if the total area of such contiguous property does not exceed three miles on a side.

7. Upon termination of the mineral exploration permit, other than by issuance of a mineral lease, the permittee shall submit to the department the following information, which shall not include any chemical analysis or other identification of minerals, concerning any drill holes or wells drilled on state land covered by the permit:

(a) Total depth.

(b) Lithologies and depths of lithologic boundaries encountered in the hole.

(c) Logs of surveys made of the hole including gamma ray, resistivity, caliper and deviation surveys.

8. Drill hole information shall be confidential for one year after termination of the permit, and such period of confidentiality shall be extended for an additional year upon the request of the permittee.

9. Any expenditures in exploration for valuable mineral deposits made in excess of the requirements of this article during any annual period of the permit may be credited against expenditure requirements of successive annual periods of the permit.

10. In lieu of making expenditures in exploration, the permittee may elect to make a money payment of the amounts required for expenditures in exploration for valuable mineral deposits to the department.

B. Upon any partial or total relinquishment, or the cancellation or expiration of the permit other than by issuance of a mineral lease, the permittee shall fill any holes, ditches or other excavations, as may be required by the commissioner, and, as far as reasonably possible, reclaim the surface to its former condition.

C. As used in this article, "exploration" means activity conducted upon the state land covered by an exploration permit to determine the existence or nonexistence of a valuable mineral deposit, including but not limited to geological, geochemical or geophysical surveys conducted by qualified experts, and drilling, sampling and excavation, together with the costs of assay and metallurgical testing of samples from such land.

#### Section 27-253. Renewal of permit

The holder of an exploration permit may, prior to expiration of the annual period for which such permit was issued, or prior to expiration of the annual period for which such permit was renewed, file with the department an application for renewal of such permit for the ensuing annual period. No such application for renewal shall be filed, nor shall the permit be renewed, for more than four successive annual periods following expiration of the annual period for which such permit was issued. No rental shall be payable for the first annual period for which a permit may be renewed. The rental for each of the three subsequent annual periods following the first annual period for which a permit may be renewed shall be one dollar for each acre of state land for which the application for renewal is filed. Upon receipt by the department of the application for renewal, and the affidavit of expenditure of the required amount in exploration during the current annual period or a sum equal thereto, together with such other proof in support of such expenditure as the commissioner by regulation may prescribe, and payment to the department of the rental for the ensuing annual period, all prior to expiration of the current annual period, the commissioner shall issue a renewal of the permit for the ensuing annual period.

#### Section 27-254. Mineral lease

Following discovery of a valuable mineral deposit upon the state land covered by a mineral exploration permit within a rectangular subdivision of twenty acres, more or less, or lot, of the public land survey, the permittee may apply to the commissioner for a mineral lease upon the state land within such rectangular subdivision, or lot, and such land shall, for the purpose of the application and any mineral lease issued pursuant to such application, constitute a mineral claim without extralateral rights, and shall be deemed to have been located as of the date of filing the application for the mineral lease. Upon receipt of an application from the permittee for a mineral lease, and satisfactory proof of discovery of a valuable mineral deposit, the commissioner shall issue a mineral lease to the applicant for the mineral claim or claims covered by the application. From and after the date of issuance of a mineral lease, the mineral claim or claims covered by such mineral lease shall be deemed to be excluded from the exploration permit. Upon application to the commissioner, not less than thirty nor more than sixty days prior to the expiration of the lease, the lessee, if not delinquent in the payment of rental or royalty on the date of expiration of the lease, shall have a preferred right to renew the lease bearing even date with the expiration of the old lease for a term of twenty years.

#### Section 27-255. Bonds

A. The commissioner, in his discretion, may require the applicant for a mineral exploration permit, prior to issuance of such permit, to file with the commissioner a surety bond, in form and amount and with surety approved by the commissioner, conditioned upon the prompt payment to the owner and lessee of the surface of state land to be covered by the permit, or across which the permittee exercises the right of ingress or egress, for any loss to such owner or lessee from damage or destruction caused by the permittee or his or its agents or employees to grasses, forage, crops and improvements upon such state lands.

B. The commissioner may also require the permittee to furnish a bond, in a reasonable amount to be fixed by the commissioner, conditioned that the permittee will guarantee restoration of the surface of the land described in the mineral exploration permit to its former condition upon any partial or total relinquishment of such lands, or the cancellation or expiration of the permit other than by issuance of a mineral lease.

C. On default, the commissioner may use the proceeds of the bond for the purposes described in subsection A or B.

#### Section 27-256. Assignment

Any mineral exploration permit issued hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by the permittee, but such assignment shall not become effective unless and until a copy thereof is filed with the department and is approved by the commissioner. The assignee shall succeed to all of the rights and shall be subject to obligations of the permittee under the mineral exploration permit.

### Article 5 - Lease of State Lands for Common Variety Minerals

#### Section 27-271. Definition of common variety minerals

For purposes of this article, "common variety minerals":

1. Includes deposits of petrified wood, stone, pumice, pumicite or cinders, decomposed granite, sand, gravel, boulders, common clay, fill dirt and waste rock.

2. Includes deposits that, although they may have value for use in trade, manufacturing and the construction, landscaping and decorative rock industries, do not possess a distinct, special economic value for those uses beyond the normal uses of those deposits.

3. Includes material used as road base material, riprap, ballast, borrow, fill, facing stone, landscaping or ornamental uses and other similar uses.

4. Does not include limestone suitable for use in producing cement, metallurgical or chemical grade limestone or gypsum.

#### Section 27-271.01. Inventory of trust land containing common mineral products, materials and property

The department shall maintain an inventory of lands suitable for lease or sale that are within the boundaries identified in section 37-312 and are located in a county of more than six hundred thousand persons according to the most recent United States decennial census. Persons applying for reclassification of land pursuant to section 37-312 shall be notified if the land has been identified by the department as land suitable for lease or sale.

#### Section 27-272. Common variety mineral leases; terms and conditions; rules

A. The state land department may dispose of common variety minerals at auction and may execute common variety mineral leases offered at auction for the severance, extraction or disposal of common variety minerals.

B. A lease shall be comprised of not more than one legal section of six hundred forty acres, more or less, or lot of the public land survey and shall provide for:

1. A term of not more than ten years unless the commissioner considers a longer term to be necessary, but in no event may the lease issue for a term longer than twenty years.

2. A rental based on a percentage of the appraised land value, payable before the commissioner executes the lease and at the beginning of each subsequent annual period.

3. The right of the lessee:

(a) To use as much of the surface of the premises as is reasonably necessary to extract, sever, temporarily store, remove and dispose of common variety minerals.

(b) To wash, screen, crush, sort or otherwise mechanically process.

(c) Of ingress to and egress from the premises across other state lands along designated routes approved by the department.

(d) To assign the lease, provided that such assignment shall not become effective until a copy of the lease is filed with the department and is approved by the commissioner as being in the best interests of the state.

4. Other terms and conditions as the department may deem for the best interests of the state and that are not in conflict with the enabling act, constitution and laws of this state.

C. The department shall establish in the lease the terms of the royalty to be paid for all common variety minerals severed or extracted from the leased land and disposed of by the lessee. The royalty rate shall be established by auction, but it shall be at least the minimum royalty established by the department based on the appraised value of the common variety minerals. The lease shall provide for:

1. Payment of a minimum annual royalty due and payable on the anniversary date of the lease. The minimum annual royalty shall be based on a minimum annual production rate and shall be applied as a credit to payment for common variety minerals extracted or severed from the land. Royalty for any common variety mineral extracted, severed or disposed of in excess of the minimum annual production is due and payable monthly, within thirty days after billing.

2. The application of minimum annual royalty payments as a credit for payment of common variety minerals for which payment must be made.

"Well" includes any hole drilled or spudded in for the purpose, with the intention or under the representation of penetrating oil or gas bearing strata or of penetrating any strata in search of stratigraphic data pertinent to the location of oil or gas bearing strata, whether or not in either case oil or gas is actually discovered, any hole used in connection with the underground storage of hydrocarbon substances, whether liquid or gaseous, any hole used in connection with a process to inject any substance for purposes of disposal or to increase recovery, any hole used for the purpose of secondary or tertiary recovery and any hole used for the purpose of pressure maintenance.  The commission may, as it considers to be in the best interests of the state, determine that any hole drilled or spudded in shall be included within this definition to the extent necessary for the administration and enforcement of the rules required by section 27-516.  The determination of the commission shall be final in any circumstance involving the question of purpose, intent or representation, except that the determination shall be subject to appeal as provided by section 27-520.

 

#### Section 27-502. Declaration of policy

A. It is the public policy of the state to:

1. Conserve the natural resources of oil and gas and products thereof.

2. Prevent waste of oil and gas resources.

3. Provide for protection and adjustment of correlative rights of owners of land wherein the natural resources lie and of owners and producers of oil and gas resources and products thereof, and of others interested therein.

4. Encourage development of natural resources of oil and gas and their products.

5. Encourage continuous and economic supply thereof and demand therefor.

6. Safeguard the health, property and public welfare of citizens of the state and other interested persons.

7. Promote all purposes indicated by the provisions of this article.

B. This article shall be administered by the oil and gas conservation commission.

C. The legislature finds and declares that oil and gas in commercial quantities have now been discovered and are being produced within this state.

#### Section 27-503. Waste of oil or gas prohibited; powers of commissioner to prevent waste

A. Waste of oil or gas is unlawful and is prohibited.

B. The commissioner shall make inquiries he deems proper to determine whether waste exists or is imminent. In the exercise of such power the commissioner may:

1. Collect data.

2. Make investigations and inspections.

3. Examine property, leases, papers, books and records, including drilling records and logs.

4. Examine, check, test and gauge oil and gas wells, tanks, refineries and modes of transportation.

5. Hold hearings.

6. Require keeping of records and making of reports.

7. Take action he deems necessary to enforce and effectuate the provisions of this article.

C. The commissioner may in order to prevent waste and avoid drilling unnecessary wells, permit the cycling of gas in any pool or portion thereof or the introduction of gas or other substance into an oil or gas reservoir for the purpose of repressuring the reservoir, maintaining pressure or carrying on secondary recovery operations of any type. The commissioner shall permit the pooling or integration of separate tracts when reasonably necessary in connection with the operations.

#### Section 27-504. Drilling units; rules and regulations; exceptions

A. For the prevention of waste, to protect and enforce the correlative rights of owners in a pool, and to avoid augmentation and accumulation of risks arising from drilling an excessive number of wells, or reduced recovery which might result from too small a number of wells, the commission shall, after a hearing, establish a drilling unit or units for each pool. The establishment of a unit for gas shall be limited to the production of gas.

B. Each well permitted to be drilled on a drilling unit shall be drilled under the applicable rules and regulations and in accordance with the applicable spacing pattern prescribed by the commission. Exceptions to the rules and spacing pattern may be granted where it is shown, after notice and hearing, that the unit is partly outside the pool or, for some other reason, a well so located on the unit would be non-productive. Exceptions permitting a proposed well to be drilled on an unorthodox location may be granted on the basis of topography or terrain without notice or hearing.

C. If an exception is granted, the commission shall take action which will offset any advantage which the person securing the exception may have over other producers by reason of drilling the well as an exception, and so that drainage from developed units to the tract with respect to which the exception is granted will be prevented or minimized, and the producer of the well drilled as an exception will be allowed to produce no more than a just and equitable share of the oil and gas in the pool.

#### Section 27-505. Pooling of interests

A. When two or more separately owned tracts of land are embraced within an established drilling unit, persons owning the drilling rights therein and the right to share in the production therefrom may agree to pool their interests and develop their lands as a drilling unit. If the persons do not agree to pool their interests, the commissioner may, for prevention of waste, for protection of correlative rights, or to avoid drilling of unnecessary wells, enter an order pooling and integrating their interests for the development of their lands as a drilling unit.  Orders effectuating such pooling shall be made after notice and hearing, and shall be upon terms and conditions which will afford the owner of each tract the opportunity to recover or receive his just and equitable share of the oil and gas in the pool without unnecessary expense. Operations incident to drilling a well upon any portion of a unit covered by a pooling order shall be deemed for all purposes to be the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit by the several owners thereof. The portion of the production allocated to the owner of each tract included in a drilling unit formed by a pooling order shall, when produced, be considered as if it had been produced from the tract by a well drilled thereon. If such pooling is effectuated, the cost of development and operation of the pooled unit chargeable by the operator to other interested owners shall be limited to the actual and reasonable expenditures required for that purpose, including a reasonable charge for supervision. As to owners who refuse to agree upon pooling, the order shall provide for reimbursement for costs chargeable to each such owner out of, and only out of, production from the unit belonging to such owner. In event of dispute relative to such costs, the commissioner shall upon notice to all interested parties and hearing thereon, determine the proper costs. Appeals may be taken from the determination as from any other order of the commissioner. If one or more of the owners drills and operates, or pays the expense of drilling and operating the well for the benefit of others, then, in addition to any other rights conferred by the pooling order, the owner or owners so drilling or operating shall have a lien on the share of production from the unit accruing to the interest of each of the other owners for the payment of his proportionate share of the expenses. All the oil and gas subject to the lien, or so much thereof as necessary, shall be marketed and sold by the creditor and the proceeds applied in payment of the expenses secured by the lien, with the balance if any payable to the debtor.

B. The commissioner shall, in all instances where a unit has been formed from lands or areas of more than one ownership, require the operator, upon request of an owner, but subject to the right of the operator to market production and collect the proceeds with respect to an owner in default, as provided in subsection A, to deliver to the owner or his assigns his proportionate share of the production from the well common to the drilling unit. The owner receiving his share shall provide at his own expense proper receptacles for the receipt and storage thereof.

C. If the persons owning and drilling or exercising other rights in separate tracts embraced within a drilling unit fail to agree upon the pooling of the tracts and drilling of a well on the unit, and if the commissioner is without authority to require pooling as provided by this section, then, subject to all other applicable provisions of this article, the owner of each tract embraced within the drilling unit may drill on his tract, but the allowable production from the tract shall be the proportion of the allowable production for the full drilling unit as the area of such separately owned tract bears to the full drilling unit.

D. An agreement for repressuring or pressure-maintenance operations, cycling or recycling operations, including extraction and separation of liquid hydrocarbons from natural gas in connection therewith, or for carrying on any other method of unit or cooperative development or operation of a field or pool or a part of either, is authorized and may be performed, and shall not be held or construed to violate any statutes of this state relating to trusts, monopolies or contracts and combinations in restraint of trade, if, after notice and a public hearing, the agreement is approved by the commissioner as being in the public interest, protective of correlative rights, and reasonably necessary to increase ultimate recovery or to prevent waste of oil or gas. The agreements shall bind only the persons who execute them, and their heirs, successors, assigns, and legal representatives.

#### Section 27-506. Regulation of drilling in pools; notice of sale, transfer or purchase

A. The commissioner shall, upon notice and hearing, regulate drilling and location of wells in any pool and the production therefrom to prevent reasonably avoidable net drainage from each developed unit so that each owner in a pool shall have the right and opportunity to recover his fair and equitable share of recoverable oil and gas in the pool.

B. A rule, regulation or order of the commissioner made under the provisions of this section shall not be of such effect as to:

1. Make it necessary for a producer from, or an owner of, a tract of land in a pool, in order to obtain his just and equitable share of the production of the pool, to drill and operate a well on the tract in addition to such wells as may without waste produce his share.

2. Occasion net drainage unless wells are drilled and operated on the tract in addition to such wells thereon as can without waste produce the tract's just and equitable share of the production of the pool.

C. Any owner of a well, any owner of land upon which a well is located, or any lessor or lessee of land upon which a well is located shall notify the commission, in writing and on such form as the commission may prescribe, of the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or exchange of such well, land or lease. Such notice shall be made within ten days of such sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or exchange and shall contain:

1. The name and address of the person to whom sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or exchanged.

2. The name and location of the well.

3. The date of the sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or exchange.

D. Any person who acquires ownership or operation of any well, ownership of any land upon which a well is located or any lease rights to land on which a well is located, whether by purchase, assignment, transfer, conveyance, exchange or otherwise, shall, within ten days after acquiring such well, land or lease rights, notify the commission, in writing and on such form as the commission may prescribe, of his ownership or operation. Such notice shall contain:

1. The name and address of the person from whom acquired.

2. The name and location of the well.

3. The date of acquisition.

4. The date when operations are assumed or resumed by new owner.

#### Section 27-507.01. Common purchaser of crude oil and petroleum; duties; ratable taking; discrimination prohibited

A. Every person as defined in this article which may now, or hereafter, purchase crude oil or petroleum in this state, whether they be common carriers or affiliated with common carriers or not, shall be a common purchaser of such crude oil or petroleum, and shall purchase crude oil or petroleum offered it for purchase without discrimination in favor of one producer or person as against another in the same field. The question of justice or unreasonableness shall be determined by the commission, taking into consideration the production and age of the wells in respective fields and all other proper factors. It shall be unlawful for any common purchaser to discriminate between or against crude oil or petroleum of a similar kind or quality in favor of its own production, or production in which it may be directly or indirectly interested, either in whole or in part, but for the purpose of allocating the purchase of crude oil or petroleum to be marketed, such production shall be taken in like manner as that of any other person or producer and shall be taken in a ratable proportion that such production bears to the total production offered for the market in such field. The commission shall have the authority, however, to relieve any such common purchaser, after due notice and hearing, from the duty of purchasing crude oil or petroleum of inferior quality or grade.

B. It shall be the duty of the commission to enforce the provisions of this section and it shall have the power, after notice and hearing, to issue orders defining the conditions under which extensions of pipelines shall be made to connect wells, but no such order shall be made unless the commission finds that such extensions are reasonably required and economically justified. In issuing such orders the commission shall give specific consideration to the economic factors involved.

#### Section 27-508.01. Common purchaser of gas; duties; ratable taking; discrimination prohibited

A. Every person as defined in this article now or hereafter engaged in purchasing from one or more producers, gas produced from gas wells shall be a common purchaser thereof within each pool from which it purchases, and as such it shall purchase gas lawfully produced from gas wells with which its gas transportation facilities are connected in the pool and other gas lawfully produced within the pool and tendered to a point on its gas transportation facilities. Such purchases shall be made without unjust or unreasonable discrimination in favor of one producer against another in the price paid, the quantities purchased, the bases of measurement, or the gas transportation facilities afforded for gas of like quantity, quality, and pressure available from such wells. The question of justice or reasonableness shall be determined by the commission. In the event any such common purchaser is likewise a producer, he is prohibited to the same extent from discriminating in favor of himself on production from gas wells in which he has an interest, direct or indirect, either in whole or in part, as against other production from gas wells in the same pool. For the purposes of this section, reasonable differences in prices paid or facilities afforded, or both, shall not constitute unreasonable discrimination if such differences bear a fair relationship to differences in quality, quantity or pressure of the gas available, the depth of the producing formation, or to the relative lengths of time during which such gas will be available to the purchaser. The provisions of this section shall not apply to:

1. Any well or pools used for storage and withdrawal from storage of natural gas originally produced not in violation of this section or of the rules, regulations or orders of the commission.

2. Purchases of casinghead gas from oil wells.

3. Persons purchasing gas principally for use in operations for secondary recovery of oil or gas, or for pressure maintenance, or cycling, or gas lift operations.

B. If a person is unable to purchase all the gas offered, or whenever the requirement for natural gas produced in Arizona from any pool can be fulfilled only by the production of natural gas therefrom under conditions constituting waste, or whenever the commission finds and determines that the orderly development of, and production of natural gas from, any pool requires the exercise of its jurisdiction, then said person shall purchase gas ratably so as to take the gas in proportion to the allowables or allocations established by the commission from all the wells to which it is connected, but this shall not apply when a difference in their production results from the inability of a well to produce proportionately with other wells connected to the purchaser, and in the event allowables or allocations have not been established by the commission, then said person shall purchase gas ratably from all wells to which it is connected in a manner so as to prevent waste and protect correlative rights as defined in this article. Any common purchaser taking gas produced from gas wells from a pool shall take ratably in accordance with the allocation formula, as may be established by special field rules or statewide regulations of the commission.

C. Nothing in this section shall be construed or applied to require any person to purchase gas of a quality, pressure, or any other condition, by reason of which such gas cannot be economically and satisfactorily used by such purchaser by means of his gas transportation facilities then in service.

#### Section 27-509. Certificate of compliance

A. An owner or operator of an oil or gas well shall, before connecting with an oil or gas pipe line, secure from the commissioner a certificate showing compliance with the conservation laws of the state and the conservation rules, regulations and orders of the commissioner. No operator of a pipe line shall connect with a well until the owner or operator furnishes a certificate of compliance.

B. The commissioner may cancel a certificate of compliance issued under this section when it appears, after due notice and hearing, that the owner or operator of a well has violated or is violating an oil or gas conservation law of the state, or a rule, regulation or order of the commissioner promulgated thereunder. Upon notice from the commissioner to the operator of a pipe line connected to any such oil or gas well that the certificate of compliance has been cancelled, the operator of the pipe line shall disconnect from the well, and it shall be unlawful for the operator of the pipe line to transport oil or gas therefrom until a new certificate of compliance has been issued by the commissioner. The owner or operator of a well shall not produce oil or gas therefrom unless a certificate of compliance is in effect covering the well.

C. This section shall not be construed to prevent a temporary connection of not more than ten days' duration with a well in order to take care of production and prevent waste until opportunity has been given the owner or operator of the well to secure a certificate of compliance. If the certificate of compliance is not secured within the ten-day period, the well shall be shut in until such time as a certificate of compliance is secured.

#### Section 27-510. Certificate of clearance

A. The sale, purchase or acquisition, or the transportation, refining, processing or handling of illegal oil or gas or illegal product is unlawful, but until the commissioner provides for certificates of clearance or some other method affording an opportunity to determine whether a contemplated transaction involves illegal oil or gas or illegal product, no penalty shall be imposed except as provided by subsection B.

B. Penalties may be imposed for each transaction prohibited by this section when the person committing the prohibited transaction knows that illegal oil or gas or illegal product is involved in the transaction or when the person could have known or determined such fact by the exercise of reasonable diligence or from facts within his knowledge.

C. Penalties provided in this article shall apply, regardless of lack of actual notice or knowledge, to any sale, purchase or acquisition, and to transportation, refining, sale, purchase or handling in any way without a certificate of clearance of illegal oil and gas or illegal product, where administrative provision is made for identifying the character of the commodity as to its legality.

#### Section 27-511. Confiscation proceedings

A. Illegal oil and gas and illegal products shall be seized and sold as contraband. The sale shall not take place unless the court finds in a proceeding held as provided by this section, that the commodity involved is contraband.

B. If the commissioner believes that illegal oil or gas or illegal product is subject to seizure and sale, he shall, through the attorney general, bring a civil action in rem for that purpose in the superior court of the county in which the commodity is found, or the action may be maintained in connection with any action or cross action for injunction, or for penalty relating to any prohibited transaction involving illegal oil or gas or illegal product. Any interested person adversely affected by seizure and sale may intervene in the suit to protect his rights. The action shall proceed in the name of the state as plaintiff against the illegal oil or gas or illegal product as defendant, and no bond shall be required of plaintiff.

C. Upon filing of the complaint, the clerk of the court shall issue a summons directed to the sheriff of the county or to any person the court may authorize to serve process, requiring him to summon all persons interested in the illegal oil or gas or illegal product mentioned in the complaint to appear and answer within thirty days after issuance and service of summons. Such persons need not be named or otherwise identified. The summons shall contain the style and number of the suit and a brief statement of the nature of the action. It shall be served by posting one copy at the courthouse door of the county in which the commodity is alleged to be located and by posting another copy near the place where the commodity is located. Copies of the summons shall be posted not less than five days before the return day stated therein, and posting shall be deemed constructive possession of the commodity by the state. A copy of the summons shall be published once each week for three weeks in a newspaper published in the county where the suit is pending. No judgment shall be pronounced by a court condemning the commodity as contraband until five days from the last publication of the summons. Proof of service by the person authorized by the court to serve process shall be by affidavit of the person making the service and proof of service by the sheriff shall be by return as required by law with respect to service of process in civil actions.

D. When it appears by a verified pleading on the part of the plaintiff, or by affidavit, that grounds for the seizure and sale exist, the clerk, in addition to the summons, shall issue an order of seizure, which shall be signed by the clerk and bear the seal of the court. The order of seizure shall specifically describe the illegal oil or gas or illegal product so that it may be identified with reasonable certainty. It shall direct the sheriff to whom addressed to take into his actual or constructive custody the illegal oil or gas or illegal product described in the order, and hold the commodity subject to order of the court. The order of seizure shall be executed as a writ of attachment is executed. No bond shall be required before the issuance of the order of seizure, and the sheriff shall be responsible upon his official bond for the proper execution thereof.

E. The sheriff shall receive, for his service, a fee as in case of seizure of personal property, to be assessed as other costs in the cause.

#### Section 27-512. Sale of illegal oil or gas or illegal products

A. Sale and notice of sale of illegal oil or gas or illegal product seized under the authority of this article shall be in accordance with the laws of the state relating to the sale of personal property under execution. For his services at the sale the sheriff shall receive a fee and expenses in the amount and manner provided by law for sales of personal property, to be paid from the proceeds of the sale, to be fixed by the court ordering the sale.

B. The court may order that the commodity be sold in specified lots or portions, and at specified intervals. Title to the amount sold shall pass as of the date of the act which is found by the court to make the commodity contraband. The judgment shall provide for payment of the proceeds of the sale into the fund, after first deducting the costs of the proceedings and sale, and after paying to any royalty owner intervening as an interested party in the suit who has established title to the oil or gas royalty interest, the value of his interest in the oil or gas. The amount sold shall be treated as legal oil, legal gas or legal product in the hands of the purchaser, but the purchaser and the commodity shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, regulations and orders with respect to further sale, purchase or acquisition, and with respect to the transportation, refining, processing or handling in any manner the commodity purchased.

C. The producer, owner, or other party contesting the validity of a seizure and having an interest in securing the release of the seized oil, gas or other product, may obtain the release thereof upon furnishing a bond made and executed by a corporate surety company duly qualified to do business in the state, in an amount double the current market value of the oil, gas or other product held under seizure. The bond shall be conditioned and approved in the same manner as a replevin bond.

D. Nothing in this article shall deny or abridge any action a royalty owner, lien holder or other claimant may have because of the forfeiture of the illegal oil or gas or illegal product, against the person whose act resulted in the forfeiture.

E. All illegal oil, gas, or other illegal product sold as provided in this section shall be sold as provided by law for the sale of personal property under execution.

#### Section 27-513. Permit to drill well

A person desiring to drill a well in search of oil or gas shall notify the commissioner on a form prescribed by the commissioner, and shall pay a fee of twenty-five dollars for each well. Upon receipt of notification and the fee, the commissioner shall promptly issue the person a permit to drill, unless drilling the well is contrary to law or to a rule, regulation or order of the commissioner. Drilling the well is prohibited until a permit to drill is obtained in accordance with the provisions of this section.

#### Section 27-513.01. Appointment by drilling permittee of attorney upon whom to serve process

A. The acceptance of a permit to drill under section 27-513 shall be deemed to constitute and be the appointment of the commission by the permittee as his true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all legal process in an action against such permittee growing out of or in any way connected with said permittee's use, occupancy, or activities upon the drilling unit or tract of land under single ownership for which his permit shall have issued, including, but not limited to, liabilities to the state, debts contracted by such permittee for labor upon or materials furnished to his drilling site, and violations of the securities act of Arizona.

B. Service of process under subsection A of this section shall be made by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint and a fee of two dollars with any member, officer, or employee of the commission in the commission's office during office hours, and shall be deemed sufficient service upon the permittee if either of the following are complied with:

1. The plaintiff forthwith sends notice of such service and a copy of the summons and complaint by registered mail to the permittee defendant at the latest address for such permittee shown by records in the office of the commission, appends the defendant's return receipt and plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this section to the original summons and files them with the court within such time as the court allows.

2. The plaintiff serves notice of such service and a copy of the summons and complaint upon defendant, if found without this state, by a duly constituted officer qualified to serve like process in the state or jurisdiction where the defendant is found, and files with the court within such time as the court allows, the officer's return showing that the notice, copy of the summons and complaint were served as provided by this section upon defendant.

C. The court in which the action is pending may order postponements necessary to afford defendant reasonable opportunity to defend the action.

D. The commission shall keep a record, which shall include the day and hour of service, of all process served upon it under this section.

E. The fee paid to the commission at the time of service shall be taxed as costs in the suit if plaintiff recovers, and shall be paid into the fund.

#### Section 27-517. Hearings; reporter; fees

A. Any interested person shall, by written request, have the right to have the commissioner call a hearing for the purpose of taking action in respect to any matter within the jurisdiction of the commissioner.  Hearings shall be held at the time and place the commissioner directs, and any person having an interest in the subject matter of the hearing may appear and be heard. Upon receipt of the request, the commissioner shall promptly call a hearing, and, not more than thirty days thereafter shall take action with regard to the matter as he deems appropriate. The request for hearing shall be accompanied by a fee of fifty dollars.

B. The commissioner shall prescribe rules of order and procedure in hearings or other proceedings held under this article. The commissioner shall appoint a competent shorthand reporter to be present throughout all public hearings. The reporter shall be sworn by the commissioner faithfully to perform the duties of a reporter. The commissioner shall have the same control and authority over the reporter as the judge of the superior court exercises over a court reporter, and the duties of the reporter shall, insofar as applicable, be the same as those fixed by law for a court reporter.

C. As soon as possible following the hearing the commission shall bill the person requesting the hearing for the total cost of publication for the notices of such hearing and the total cost of the court reporter's fees less the original fifty dollar fee. The requesting party shall within ten days after receipt of the billing by the commission reimburse the commission the amount of money so billed or be subject to the penalties as prescribed in subsection A of section 27-527. The money so collected by the commission shall not be subject to section 27-523 but shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, by the commission in the fund from which the expenditure was originally made.

 

#### Section 27-519. Refusal to obey subpoena

A. If a person fails or refuses to comply with a subpoena issued by the commissioner, or if a witness refuses to testify or answer to a matter regarding which he may be lawfully interrogated, the judge of the superior court of the county where such person resides, if a resident of the state, or the judge of the superior court of the county in which the land or any part thereof lies out of which the controversy arises, if the person is not a resident of the state, may, on application of the commissioner, issue an attachment for such person and compel him to comply with the subpoena and appear before the commissioner and produce such documents and give testimony upon such matters as required.

B. The court may punish for contempt as in case of disobedience of a subpoena issued by the court, or for refusal to testify.

#### Section 27-520. Judicial review; procedures

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section and section 41-1092.08, subsection H, any party aggrieved by any final action of the commission is entitled to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

B. An action involving a test of the validity of this article or a rule or order shall be advanced for trial and determined as expeditiously as possible, and no postponement or continuance shall be granted unless deemed imperative by the court.

 

#### Section 27-521. Duties of attorney general

The attorney general shall be attorney for the commissioner. The commissioner may in cases of emergency or in special cases, upon request of the attorney general, retain additional counsel to assist the attorney general, and for such purpose may expend funds available under this article.

#### Section 27-522. Records

A. All rules and orders made by the commission shall be in writing and entered in full in a book kept by the commission.  The book shall be a public record open to inspection at all reasonable times during office hours.  A copy of any rule, order or other document on file in the office of the commission and certified by the commission shall be received in evidence in all courts of the state with the same effect as the original.

B. Well logs, casing records, compiled data and other information shall be properly indexed and suitably recorded in the permanent records of the commission and shall be open to inspection by the public at all reasonable times during office hours.  The well records of a well drilled in unproven territory shall not be subject to inspection for a period of one year after drilling is completed.  The commission shall provide sixty days' notice to the operator before records become subject to inspection.  At the operator's request, the commission shall extend the confidential period for not more than two years from the date of the request if the operator can provide credible evidence that disclosure of the information is likely to cause harm to the operator's competitive position.  The director of water resources may inspect any well records at any time but shall keep confidential all information that is not subject to inspection as otherwise provided in this section.

 

#### Section 27-523. Deposit of monies; expenses

A. Monies collected by the commissioner under this article shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the fund.

B. Expenses incident to the administration of this article shall be paid from the fund, subject to legislative appropriation.

 

#### Section 27-524. Enforcement

A. When it appears that a person is violating or threatening to violate any provision of this article, or a rule, regulation or order made pursuant to this article, and such person fails or refuses, on notice by the commissioner, to desist from such violation or threat of violation, the commissioner may bring an action in the superior court where the offending person resides, or in the county in which violation is alleged to have occurred or is threatened, to restrain the person from continuing the violation or from carrying out a threat of violation.

B. The commissioner may without bond obtain a prohibitory or mandatory injunction, including a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and, where appropriate, an injunction restraining defendant from moving or disposing of illegal oil or gas or illegal product. Upon filing the action, summons directed to such person may be delivered to the sheriff of any county in this state for service.

C. If the commissioner fails to bring action within ten days to enjoin a threatened or actual violation of any statute relating to conservation of oil and gas, or of any provision of this article, or a rule, regulation or order made pursuant to this article, any person or party in interest adversely affected by the threatened or actual violation who has notified the commissioner in writing thereof and requested the commissioner to file the action may bring the action in the superior court of any county in which the commissioner might have brought the action to prevent the threatened or actual violation. The commissioner shall be made a party to the action.

D. If the court orders that injunctive relief be granted, then the commissioner shall be substituted for the person who brought the action, and the injunction shall issue as if the commissioner had at all times been plaintiff.

E. The owner or operator is responsible for the full cost of plugging each dry or abandoned well. If the owner or operator fails to properly plug and abandon the well, the commission may:

1. Forfeit the bond and use the money for that purpose.

2. Sue the owner or operator for costs in excess of the amount of the bond and the owner or operator is liable for that amount.

#### Section 27-525. Injunctions and restraining orders

A. No temporary restraining order or injunction shall be granted against the commissioner or his agent, employee or representative to restrain enforcement of a statute relating to the conservation of oil and gas or any provision of this article, or rule, regulation or order made thereunder, except after notice to the commissioner and all other defendants, and a hearing thereon. At the hearing a restraining order or injunction shall not be granted unless it is shown that the act done or threatened is unlawful, or that the statute, or provision of this article, or rule, regulation or order complained of is invalid and, if enforced, will cause irreparable injury to plaintiff. An order granting temporary or injunctive relief shall state the nature and extent of the invalidity of the statute, rule, regulation or order complained of and shall contain a statement of the probable damage relied upon by the court as justifying temporary injunctive relief.

B. No temporary injunction or restraining order against the commissioner, or his agent, employee, or representative shall become effective until plaintiff executes a bond in an amount and conditioned as the court directs. The bond shall be made payable to the clerk of the court, shall be approved by the judge, and shall be for the use and benefit of all persons who may be injured by the acts done under the protection of the restraining order or injunction. Any action upon the bond by any person claiming injury shall be brought within not more than six months after the date of final determination of the validity, in whole or in part, of such statute, provision of this article, or rule, regulation or order, the enforcement of which was restrained or enjoined.

#### Section 27-526. Appeals

In an action brought under this article, or an action which involves any rule, regulation or order made under this article, any party to the action shall have the right to appeal from the superior court to the supreme court as provided by law or rules of court relating to appeals in civil actions.

#### Section 27-527. Violation; classification

A. Any person who violates any provision of this article, or any rule, regulation or order of the commission, is subject to a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars for each violation and for each day the violation continues.

B. Any person who, with the intent to evade this article, or any rule, regulation or order of the commission, knowingly makes or causes to be made a false entry in any application, report, record, account or memorandum required by this article or by any such rule, regulation or order, or who knowingly omits or causes to be omitted from any application, report, record, account or memorandum, full, true and correct entries as required by this article, or by any such rule, regulation or order, or who knowingly removes from this state, or destroys, mutilates, alters or falsifies any such application, record, account or memorandum or knowingly makes any false statement to the commission or any member, officer, or employee of the commission concerning any matter within the jurisdiction of the commission is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor.

C. The penalties provided in this section shall be recoverable by action filed by the attorney general, in the name and on behalf of the state, in the superior court of the county in which the defendant resides, or in which any defendant resides if there are more than one defendant, or in the superior court of any county in which the violation occurred. The payment of any penalty shall not operate to legalize so that it is no longer contraband any oil, gas or product involved in the violation for which the penalty is imposed, and shall not relieve a person on whom the penalty is imposed from liability to any other person for damages arising out of the violation.

### Article 1.1 - Fieldwide Unitization

#### Section 27-531. Integration of interests and spacing units

A. To prevent or to assist in preventing waste, to insure a greater recovery of oil and gas, and to protect the correlative rights of persons owning interests in the tracts of lands affected, such persons may validly integrate their interests to provide for the unitized management, development and operation of such tracts of land as a unit. Where, however, such persons have not agreed to so integrate their interests, the commission, upon proper petition, after notice and hearing as provided in section 27-516 shall be vested with the jurisdiction and authority, and it shall be its duty to make and enforce such orders and do such things as may be necessary or proper to carry out and effectuate the purposes of this article.

B. The commission shall make an order providing for the unitized operation of a pool or part thereof if, after proper petition and notice and hearing it finds that:

1. The unitized management, operation and further development of a pool or portion thereof is reasonably necessary in order to effectively carry on pressure control, pressure-maintenance or repressuring operations, cycling operations, water flooding operations, or any combination thereof, or any other form of joint effort calculated to substantially increase the ultimate recovery of oil and gas from the pool; and

2. One or more of the unitized methods of operation as applied to such pool or portion thereof are feasible, will prevent waste and will, with reasonable probability, result in the increased recovery of substantially more oil and gas from the pool than would otherwise be recovered; and

3. The estimated additional cost, if any, of conducting such operations will not exceed the value of the additional oil and gas so recovered.

#### Section 27-532. Order; units and unit areas; plan of unitization

The order of the commission shall define the area of the pool or portion thereof to be included within the unit area and prescribe with reasonable detail the plan of unitization applicable thereto. Each unit and unit area shall be limited to all or a portion of a single pool. Only so much of a pool as has been defined and determined to be productive of oil and gas by actual drilling operations may be so included within the unit area. A unit may be created to embrace less than the whole of a pool only where it is shown by the evidence that the area to be so included within the unit area is of such size and shape as may be reasonably required for the successful and efficient conduct of the unitized method of operation for which the unit is created, and that the conduct thereof will have no material adverse effect upon the remainder of such pool. The plan of unitization for each such unit and unit area shall be one suited to the needs and requirements of the particular unit dependent upon the facts and conditions found to exist with respect thereto. In addition to such other terms, provisions, conditions and requirements found by the commission to be reasonably necessary or proper to effectuate or accomplish the purpose of this article, and subject to the further requirements hereof, each such plan of unitization shall contain fair, reasonable and equitable provisions for:

1. The efficient unitized management or control of the further development and operation of the unit area for the recovery of oil and gas from the pool affected. Under such a plan the actual operations within the unit area may be carried on in whole or in part by the unit itself, or by one or more of the lessees within the unit area as the unit operator subject to the supervision and direction of the unit, dependent upon what is most beneficial or expedient. The designation of the unit operator shall be by vote of the lessees in the unit in a manner provided in the plan of unitization and not by the commission.

2. The division of interest or formula for the apportionment and allocation of the unit production, among and to the several separately owned tracts within the unit area such as will reasonably permit persons otherwise entitled to share in or benefit by the production from such separately owned tracts to produce and receive, in lieu thereof, their fair, equitable and reasonable share of the unit production or other benefits thereof. A separately owned tract's fair, equitable, and reasonable share of the unit production shall be measured by the value of each such tract for oil and gas purposes and its contributing value to the unit in relation to like values of other tracts in the unit, taking into consideration acreage, the quantity of oil and gas recoverable therefrom, location on the structure, its probable productivity of oil and gas in the absence of unit operations, the burden of operations to which the tract will or is likely to be subjected, or so many of said factors, or such other pertinent engineering, geological or operating factors, as may be reasonably susceptible of determination. "Unit production" as that term is used in this article means and includes all oil and gas produced from a unit area from and after the effective date of the order of the commission creating the unit regardless of the well or tract within the unit area from which the same is produced.

3. The manner in which the unit and the further development and operation of the unit area shall or may be financed and the basis, terms and conditions on which the cost and expense thereof shall be apportioned among and assessed against the tracts and interest made chargeable therewith, including a detailed accounting procedure governing all charges and credits incident to such operations. Upon and subject to such terms and conditions as to time and rate of interest as may be fair to all concerned, reasonable provision shall be made in the plan of unitization for carrying or otherwise financing lessees who are unable to meet promptly their financial obligations in connection with the unit.

4. The procedure and basis upon which wells, equipment and other properties of the several lessees within the unit area are to be taken over and used for unit operations, including the method of arriving at the compensation therefor, or of otherwise proportionately equalizing or adjusting the investment of the several lessees in the project as of the effective date of unit operation.

5. The supervision and conduct of the unit operations, in respect to which each person shall have a vote with a value corresponding to the percentage of the costs of unit operations chargeable against the interest of such person.

6. The time when the plan of unitization shall become effective.

7. The time when and the conditions under which and the method by which the unit shall or may be dissolved and its affairs wound up.

#### Section 27-533. Ratification or approval of plan by lessees and owners

A. No order of the commission creating a unit and prescribing the plan of unitization applicable thereto shall become effective unless and until the plan of unitization has been signed, or in writing ratified or approved by lessees of record of not less than sixty-three per cent of the unit area affected thereby and by owners of record of not less than sixty-three per cent (exclusive of royalty interest owned by lessees or by subsidiaries of any lessee) of the normal one-eighth royalty interest in and to the unit area, and the commission has made a finding either in the order creating the unit or in a supplemental order that the plan of unitization has been so signed, ratified or approved by lessees and royalty owners owning the required percentage interest in and to the unit area.  Where the plan of unitization has not been so signed, ratified or approved by lessees and royalty owners owning the required percentage interest in and to the unit area at the time the order creating the unit is made, the commission shall, upon petition and notice, hold such additional and supplemental hearings as may be requested or required to determine if and when the plan of unitization has been so signed, ratified or approved by lessees and royalty owners owning the required percentage interest in and to the unit area and shall, in respect to such hearings, make and enter a finding of its determination in such regard. In the event lessees and royalty owners, or either, owning the required percentage interest in and to the unit area have not so signed, ratified or approved the plan of unitization within a period of six months from and after the date on which the order creating the unit is made, the order creating the unit shall cease to be of further force and effect and shall be revoked by the commission.

B. An order providing for unit operations may be amended by an order made by the commission, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order providing for unit operations, provided:

1. If such an amendment affects only the rights and interests of the owners, the approval of the amendment by the royalty owners shall not be required.

2. No such order of amendment shall change the percentage for allocation of oil and gas as established for any separately owned tract by the original order, except with the consent of all persons owning interests in such tract.

C. The commission, by an order, may provide for the unit operation of a pool or a part thereof that embraces a unit area established by a previous order of the commission. Such order, in providing for the allocation of unit production, shall first treat the unit area previously established as a single tract, and the portion of the unit production so allocated thereto shall then be allocated among the separately owned tracts included in such previously established unit area in the same proportions as those specified in the previous order.

#### Section 27-534. Unlawful operation

From and after the effective date of an order of the commission creating a unit and prescribing the plan of unitization applicable thereto, the operation of any well producing from the pool or portion thereof within the unit area defined in the order by persons other than the unit or persons acting under its authority or except in the manner and to the extent provided in such plan of unitization shall be unlawful and is prohibited.

#### Section 27-535. Status and powers of unit; liability and expenses; lien

A. The obligation or liability of the lessees or other owners of the oil and gas rights in the several separately owned tracts for the payment of unit expense shall at all times be several and not joint or collective and in no event shall a lessee or other owner of the oil and gas rights in the separately owned tract be chargeable with, obligated or liable, directly or indirectly, for more than the amount apportioned, assessed or otherwise charged to his interest in such separately owned tract pursuant to the plan of unitization and then only to the extent of the lien provided for in this article.

B. Subject to such reasonable limitations as may be set out in the plan of unitization, the unit shall have a first and prior lien upon the leasehold estate and all other oil and gas rights (exclusive of one-eighth landowners' royalty interest) in and to each separately owned tract, the interest of the owners thereof in and to the unit production and all equipment in the possession of the unit, to secure the payment of the amount of the unit expense charged to and assessed against such separately owned tract. The interest of the lessee or other persons who by lease, contract or otherwise are obligated or responsible for the cost and expense of developing and operating a separately owned tract for oil and gas in the absence of unitization shall, however, be primarily responsible for and charged with any assessment for unit expense made against such tract and resort may be had to overriding royalties, oil and gas payments, royalty interests in excess of one-eighth of the production, or other interests which otherwise are not chargeable with such costs, only in the event the owner of the interest primarily responsible fails to pay such assessment or the production to the credit thereof, is insufficient for that purpose. In the event the owner of any royalty interest, overriding royalty, oil or gas payment, or any other interest which under the plan of unitization is not primarily responsible therefor pays in whole or in part the amount of an assessment for unit expense for the purpose of protecting such interest or the amount of the assessment in whole or in part is deducted from the unit production to the credit of such interest, the owner thereof shall to the extent of such payment or deduction be subrogated to all the rights of the unit with respect to the interest or interests primarily responsible for such assessment. A one-eighth part of the unit production allocated to each separately owned tract shall in all events be regarded as royalty to be distributed to and among, or the proceeds thereof paid to, the royalty owners free and clear of all unit expense and free of any lien therefor.

#### Section 27-536. Modification of property rights, leases and contracts; title to property; distribution of proceeds; delivery in kind; effect of operations; matters not affected

A. Property rights, leases, contracts and all other rights and obligations shall be regarded as amended and modified to the extent necessary to conform to the provisions and requirements of this article, and to any valid and applicable plan of unitization or order of the commission made and adopted pursuant hereto, but otherwise to remain in full force and effect. No division order or other contract relating to the sale or purchase of production from a separately owned tract shall be terminated by the order providing for unit operations, but shall remain in force and apply to oil and gas allocated to such tract until terminated in accordance with the provisions thereof.

B. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to require a transfer to or vesting in the unit of title to the separately owned tracts or leases thereon within the unit area, other than the right to use and operate the same to the extent set out in the plan of unitization, nor shall the unit be regarded as owning the unit production. The unit production and the proceeds from the sale thereof shall be owned by the several persons to whom the same is allocated under the plan of unitization. All property, whether real or personal, which the unit may in any way acquire, hold or possess, shall not be acquired, held and possessed by the unit for its own account but shall be so acquired, held and possessed by the unit for the account and as agent of the several lessees and shall be the property of such lessees as their interests may appear under the plan of unitization, subject, however, to the right of the unit to the possession, management, use or disposal of the same in the proper conduct of its affairs, and subject to any lien the unit may have thereon to secure the payment of unit expense. Neither the unit production or proceeds of the sale thereof, nor the other receipts shall be treated, be regarded, or taxed as income or profits of the unit; but instead, all such receipts shall be the income of the several persons to whom or to whose credit the same are payable under the plan of unitization. To the extent the unit may receive or disburse said receipts it shall only do so as a common administrative agent of the persons to whom the same are payable.

C. The amount of the unit production allocated to each separately owned tract within the unit, and only that amount, regardless of the well or wells in the unit area from which it may be produced and regardless of whether it be more or less than the amount of the production from the well or wells, if any, on any such separately owned tract, shall for all intents, uses and purposes be regarded and considered as production from such separately owned tract, and except as may be otherwise authorized in this article, or in the plan of unitization approved by the commission, shall be distributed among or the proceeds thereof paid to the several persons entitled to share in the production from such separately owned tract in the same manner, in the same proportions, and upon the same conditions that they would have participated and shared in the production or proceeds thereof from such separately owned tract had not said unit been organized and with the same legal force and effect. If adequate provisions are made for the receipt thereof, the share of the unit production allocated to each separately owned tract shall be delivered in kind to the persons entitled thereto by virtue of ownership of oil and gas rights therein or by purchase from such owners subject to the rights of the unit to withhold and sell the same in payment of unit expense pursuant to the plan of unitization, and subject further to the call of the unit on such portions of the gas for operating purposes as may be provided in the plan of unitization.

D. Operations carried on under and in accordance with the plan of unitization shall be regarded and considered as a fulfillment of and compliance with all of the provisions, covenants and conditions, express or implied, of the several oil and gas leases upon lands included within the unit area, or other contracts pertaining to the development thereof insofar as said leases or other contracts may relate to the pool or portion thereof included in the unit area. Wells drilled or operated on any part of the unit area no matter where located shall for all purposes be regarded as wells drilled on each separately owned tract within such unit area.

E. Nothing in this article or in any plan of unitization shall be construed as increasing or decreasing the implied covenants of a lease in respect to a common source of supply or lands not included within the unit area of a unit.

#### Section 27-537. Enlargement of area; creation of new units; amendment of plan

The unit area of a unit may be enlarged to include adjoining portions of the same pool, including the unit area of another unit, and a new unit created for the unitized management, operation and further development of such enlarged unit area, or the plan of unitization may be otherwise amended, all in the same manner, upon the same conditions and subject to the same limitations as provided in this article with respect to the creation of a unit in the first instance; except that where the amendment to the plan of unitization relates only to the rights and obligations as between lessees the requirement that the same be signed, ratified and approved by royalty owners of record of not less than sixty-three per cent of the unit area shall have no application.

#### Section 27-538. Federal taxation

Any unit agreement approved by the commission shall contain language suggested by the internal revenue service under I.T. 3930 and I.T. 3948 so that owners in the unitized area will not be held taxable as a corporation.

#### Section 27-539. Validation of unit agreements

An agreement for the unit or cooperative development and operation of a field, pool, or part thereof, may be submitted to the commission for approval as being in the public interest or reasonably necessary to prevent waste. Such approval shall constitute a complete defense to any suit charging violation of any statute of the state relating to trusts and monopolies on account thereof or on account of operations conducted pursuant thereto. The failure to submit such an agreement to the commission for approval shall not for that reason imply or constitute evidence that the agreement or operations conducted pursuant thereto are in violation of laws relating to trusts and monopolies.

The department may prescribe rules and regulations necessary and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this article.

#### Section 27-553. Leasing state lands for oil and gas

The department may lease state lands for oil and gas and issue oil and gas leases as provided in this article.

#### Section 27-554. Designation of known geological structures of producing oil and gas fields

A. The department shall from time to time determine and designate the known geological structures of producing oil and gas fields. The determinations and designations shall be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the state, the last publication to be not less than five days from the first date of publication. The determinations and designations shall become effective from the date of first publication. Until such a determination and designation is made by the department, all state lands shall be deemed located not within any known geological structure of a producing oil and gas field.

B. The department may refuse to lease any state lands for oil and gas when the lands are being used by the state or any state department for a state purpose.

#### Section 27-555. Lease of state lands not located within known geological structure of producing oil and gas field; application; lease extension; provisions of lease; withdrawal of lands from leasing

A. When state lands are not located within any known geological structure of a producing oil and gas field, as determined pursuant to section 27-554, the person making the first application for the lease shall be issued a lease covering the lands without competitive bidding.

B. The noncompetitive leases shall provide for the payment by the lessee of a royalty of twelve and one-half per cent of either:

1. The oil, gas and other hydrocarbons produced and saved from the leased premises.

2. At the option of the department, the market value of such products determined as follows:

(a) At the arm's length price prevailing on the day the product is run into a pipeline or otherwise removed from the leased premises if the production is being sold for an arm's length price.

For the purposes of this subdivision, "vicinity" means the smallest geographical local area containing sufficient data to establish an arm's length price.

(c) If an arm's length price is not available for the production and there are no publicly available arm's length prices for sales of production of comparable type and quality, in generally comparable quantities, in the vicinity, the department may establish market value through appraisal completed by an independent licensed appraiser that conforms with generally recognized appraisal methodologies.  The appraisal is not binding on either the department or the lessee, but may serve as evidence of market value.

(d) If a price is determined under subdivision (b) or (c) and a price under a higher ranked alternative becomes available, the price determined under the higher ranked alternative shall be used.  If a price is determined under subdivision (b) or (c) and the basis for determining that price is no longer available, the price determined under the next highest-ranking alternative that is available shall be used.  If a price is determined by the lessees under subdivision (a), the department may require the lessee to certify that the price used is an arm's length price.

(e) For the purposes of this paragraph, "arm's length price" means a price negotiated between a willing buyer and a willing seller, where the buyer and seller are not affiliates and the seller is not receiving property or other noncash consideration as part of the transaction.  For the purposes of this subdivision, "affiliate" means parties that are related by blood or marriage, or, in the case of entities, that are under direct or indirect common control or one of which controls the other.

C. Royalties, including shut-in gas royalties, reserved to the state on production from any state lands leased pursuant to this article and committed to a unit plan of development by virtue of a unit agreement shall be paid only on that portion of production allocated to such state lands or any part of the state lands, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the unit agreement.

D. The leases shall provide for the payment in advance of an annual rental of one dollar per acre per year for each year of the primary term of the lease. All leases shall provide for a minimum rental of forty dollars per year.

E. Each lease issued under this section shall be for a primary term of five years and as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lands covered by the lease, except that:

1. If oil or gas is not being produced from the leased premises at the expiration of the primary term of the lease, the lessee shall have a right to an extension of the term of the lease for an additional term of five years and as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the leased premises by paying each year in advance double the rental payable during the primary term of the lease, except that the lessee will have no further right to any additional extension for successive terms. In the exercise of such right, the provisions of section 27-556 relating to sales made upon competitive bidding by sealed bid shall not apply in any case, but all such extensions shall be upon the terms and conditions contained in the original lease, except that the rental for the extended term shall be as provided in this paragraph, and except further that the rental for the extended term of any lease amended pursuant to subsection L of this section shall be as provided in that subsection.

2. If oil or gas is not being produced from the leased premises at the expiration of the primary term of the lease or any extension of the lease pursuant to paragraph 1, but the owner of the lease is diligently engaged in drilling, completion or reworking operations, the lease continues in force for a period of two years from the date on which the lease would have otherwise expired and as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lands. If oil or gas is produced from any such well or any other well drilled during any two year extension, the lease shall continue in force after such two year extension as long as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the leased premises, except that rental requirements at the beginning of any lease extension shall be at the rate in existence at that time.

3. Oil or gas that is produced from any part of a unit in which state lands are included by virtue of a unit agreement and that is allocated to all or any part of such state lands pursuant to the terms and conditions of the unit agreement is deemed to be produced from the state lands or that part of the state lands to which the production is allocated.

4. If for any reason production of oil or gas from the leased lands ceases after the primary term or after extension of the lease, the lease shall not terminate if the lessee commences drilling, completion or reworking operations on the land within ninety days from cessation of production, and if drilling, completion or reworking operations are conducted with reasonable diligence, the lease shall remain in force as long thereafter as such drilling, completion or reworking operations are conducted or as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the leased lands, but in no event to extend beyond two years if production is not restored.

F. Each lease shall provide that the state's royalties shall be computed after deducting any oil or gas reasonably used in operations on the lease.

G. The leases shall contain other terms and provisions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this article or other laws of the state, as in the opinion of the department are for the best interest of the state. The lease shall not contain any provision for a premium, tax, fee or other assessment other than the application fees, rentals and royalties provided in statute. Application fees, rentals, royalties or other charges shall be based upon the application fees, rentals, royalties or other charges as provided in statute in effect at the time that the completed application is received by the department.

H. Not more than six miles square shall be included in any one lease. The lands shall be in as compact a body as possible but may include noncontiguous land within the six mile area.  A discovery well capable of producing oil and gas in paying quantities will perpetuate a lease of not more than two thousand five hundred sixty acres which must be designated by the lessee within thirty days of completion of the well. The department shall adopt rules that will assure due diligence in the drilling of development wells to fully define the field.

I. Each lease shall provide that any combination, understanding or agreement entered into by the lessee, written, verbal or otherwise, for the purpose of delaying discovery or development of oil or gas is an illegal practice, and that upon legal determination thereof shall constitute grounds for cancellation of the lease. In the event of such an illegal practice, appropriate proceedings may be instituted by the attorney general against the lessee in the county in which the land or any part thereof is located. A cooperative or unit plan entered into pursuant to this article or any other conservation statute of this state shall not be held to violate this subsection or any other statute of this state prohibiting monopolies or acts, arrangements, contracts, combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce on account of operations conducted under such a plan.

J. Applications for noncompetitive leases shall be in writing addressed to the department, shall contain a description of the lands sufficient to identify them and the name and address of the applicant and shall be accompanied by a filing fee and the rental payment for the first year. Each application shall be stamped when received by the department with a stamp showing the day and hour when received. If valid applications covering the same lands are filed simultaneously, the department shall offer the lease to the parties involved in the simultaneous applications by competitive bid, as follows:

1. The department shall issue a notice of the competitive bid containing a description of the land proposed to be leased and the time when the bids will be received and opened.

2. The department shall offer the lease to the highest qualified bidder submitting a sealed bid, on the basis of a cash bonus.

3. All bids, together with a certified check in the amount of the bonus bid, must be submitted to the department at the state capitol and shall be opened at the office of the department at the time specified.

4. If identical bids are received, within ten days of the opening of the bids the department shall request new bids from the submitters of the identical bids, and shall repeat the process until a high bidder is determined.

5. Before accepting any competitive bid for a lease under this subsection, the department shall establish to its satisfaction the responsibility of the bidder.

6. The department shall return all checks accompanying rejected bids.

K. The department may withdraw from leasing any specific area of land not located within any known geological structure of a producing oil and gas field when it appears that the withdrawal is in the interest of the state, but no lands shall be withdrawn by the department without the consent of a committee composed of the governor, who shall be chairman, the attorney general, and the dean of the college of mines of the university of Arizona. The committee shall consider the proposed withdrawal presented by the department and determine whether the withdrawal shall be permitted.  The land, after being withdrawn from leasing, may again be offered for leasing at any time the department deems in the best interests of the state, subject to the advice and consent of the committee provided for in this section, and pursuant to notice as the committee deems necessary.

L. The owner of any state oil and gas lease issued by the department and maintained in good standing according to the terms and conditions of the lease and all applicable statutes and regulations shall have the right to elect at any time to have such lease amended to contain the same term and extension provisions and the same provisions relating to unit operations and unit agreements which have been or may be approved by the state land commissioner as are provided by law for state oil and gas leases upon filing a written notice of such election with the department. Upon such written notice to the department the lease term and extension provisions and the provisions relating to unit operations and unit agreements shall be deemed amended.  The lease as amended shall include all other provisions, except those providing for rents, contained in the original lease and shall bear the same commencement date as the original lease. The lease as amended shall require the payment in advance of an annual rental of one dollar fifty cents per acre per year for each year of any extension of the lease beyond the primary term of the lease, except extensions of the primary term based upon the production of oil or gas.

 

#### Section 27-555.01. Extension of lease due to lack of transportation, processing facilities or market

A. When the owner of an oil and gas lease issued pursuant to this chapter has discovered oil or gas on the leased premises or on lands joined therewith in a cooperative or pooled unit, while the lease is in full force and effect, but is unable to produce oil or gas in paying quantities because of lack of transportation or processing facilities or a market for the oil or gas that would support production in paying quantities, each lease on which there is an oil or gas well or which is part of the cooperative or pooled unit shall be extended beyond the primary term, or any extension of the lease under section 27-555, subsection E, paragraph 1, from year to year, but not to exceed a period of five years, by payment of a shut-in oil or gas royalty of one dollar per acre for the first year, two dollars per acre for the second year and three dollars per acre for the third, fourth and fifth years, payable in advance annually on the anniversary date of the lease. If the payment is made it will be deemed that oil or gas is being procured and produced in paying quantities from the leased premises for such year.

B. To successfully assert shut-in status under subsection A of this section, the owner of the lease must:

1. Complete the well by installing and perforating production casing, by installing a production liner at reservoir depth or by other standard industry practices.

2. File a standard well completion report with the commission indicating an oil or gas discovery.

3. Submit to the department, not later than thirty days before the expiration of the lease, and at or before tendering the first year's shut-in royalties, a copy of the well completion report filed with the commission and the information described in either subdivision (a) or (b) of this paragraph. A well meeting either of the following criteria is considered to be capable of production in paying quantities for the purposes of this section:

(a) A calculation reasonably demonstrating that, as of the date of submission, the monthly proceeds of the well would be expected to exceed the well's monthly operating expenses, if transportation and processing facilities were present and a market existed.  The owner may estimate monthly production based on well test results and any other data the owner considers helpful, estimate the monthly value of that production using approximate then-current pricing and estimate monthly operating expenses for the well based on recent history of comparable wells.  Costs of drilling, completing and equipping the well shall not be considered in the calculation.

(b) Information satisfying any other alternate test that may be adopted by the department for demonstrating capability to produce in paying quantities, if transportation and processing facilities were present and a market existed.

C. If the department considers that the requirements of subsection B of this section have not been met, it has ninety days after receiving the submission required under subsection B, paragraph 3 of this section in which to deny shut-in status by appealable agency order, which must identify with reasonable particularity the basis for the determination that the requirements of subsection B of this section have not been met.  The lease shall remain in effect pending final resolution, whether administrative, judicial or otherwise, as to whether the criteria in subsection B of this section have been met.

D. Subsection B of this section sets forth the full set of information that an owner of a lease must furnish the department with reasonable particularity before the expiration of the lease for which shut-in status is asserted.  To assert shut-in status, further reviews or additional tests or audits shall not be conducted for the owner to be entitled to a lease extension pursuant to this section.

E. This section shall apply to existing oil and gas leases in good standing.

 

#### Section 27-556. Lease of state lands located within known geological structure of producing oil or gas field; sealed bids; call for bids; publication; lease extension; provisions of lease; acreage limitation

When state lands are located within a known geological structure of a producing oil or gas field, as determined pursuant to section 27-554, the lands shall be leased only by sealed bids, as follows:

1. Upon receipt of an application to lease any of such lands or whenever, in the opinion of the department, there is a demand for the purchase of leases of the lands, the department shall offer the tract or tracts for lease to the highest qualified bidder submitting a sealed bid, on the basis of a cash bonus.

2. The department shall publish a call for sealed bids twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the state, the last publication to be not less than fifteen days prior to the date fixed for opening the bids.  All bids, together with a certified check in the amount of the bonus bid, shall be submitted to the department at the capitol, and opened at the office of the department at the time specified. On or before December 1 each year, the department shall designate by general order the newspaper in which the publications shall be made during the following calendar year.  The successful bidder shall pay the cost of the publication and the reasonable expenses of the sale.

3. The publication shall contain a description of the land proposed to be leased, the time when the bids will be received and opened, the royalty to be demanded which the department shall fix prior to call for bids at not less than twelve and one-half per cent, and an annual rental to be demanded in the amount of one dollar per acre for each year.

4. The publication shall set forth the form of lease which the successful bidder will be required to execute. In lieu of publishing the form of lease in its entirety the publication may specify the form of lease by designating the form number of lease on file with the department, copies of which shall be furnished any person on request.

5. Royalties, including shut-in gas royalties, reserved to the state on production from any state lands leased pursuant to this article and committed to a unit plan of development by virtue of a unit agreement shall be paid only on that portion of production allocated to such state lands or any part of the state lands, pursuant to the terms and conditions of such unit agreement.

6. Each lease issued under this section shall be for a primary term of five years and as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lands covered by the lease except that:

(a) If oil or gas is not being produced from the leased premises at the expiration of the primary term of the lease, but the owner of the lease is diligently engaged in drilling, completion or reworking operations, the lease continues in force for a period of two years from the date on which the lease would have otherwise expired and as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the lands. If oil or gas is produced from any such well or any other well drilled during any two year extension, the lease shall continue in force after such two year extension as long as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the leased premises.

(b) Oil or gas that is produced from any part of a unit in which state lands are included by virtue of a unit agreement and that is allocated to all or any part of such state lands pursuant to the terms and conditions of the unit agreement is deemed to be produced from the state lands or that part of the state lands to which the production is allocated.

(c) If for any reason production of oil or gas from the leased lands ceases after the primary term or any extension, the lease shall not terminate if the lessee commences drilling, completion or reworking operations on the land within ninety days from cessation of production, and if drilling, completion or reworking operations are conducted with reasonable diligence, the lease shall remain in force as long thereafter as such drilling, completion or reworking operations are conducted or as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities from the leased lands, but in no event to extend beyond two years if production is not restored.

7. The lease may contain other terms and provisions not inconsistent with the provisions of this article or other laws of the state, as in the opinion of the department are for the best interests of the state.

8. Each lease shall provide that the state's royalties shall be computed after deducting any oil or gas reasonably used in operations on the lease.

9. Each lease shall provide that any combination, understanding or agreement entered into by the lessee, written, verbal or otherwise, for the purpose of delaying the discovery or development of oil or gas is an illegal practice, and that upon legal determination thereof shall constitute grounds for cancellation of the lease. In the event of such an illegal practice, appropriate proceedings may be instituted by the attorney general against the lessee in the county in which the land, or any part thereof, is located. A cooperative or unit plan entered into pursuant to this article or any other conservation statute of this state shall not be held to violate this paragraph or any other statute of this state prohibiting monopolies or acts, arrangements, contracts, combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce on account of operations conducted under such a plan.

10. The owner of any state oil and gas lease issued by the department and maintained in good standing according to the terms and conditions of the lease and all applicable statutes and regulations shall have the right to elect at any time to have such lease amended to contain the same term and extension provisions and the same provisions relating to unit operations and unit agreements which have been or may be approved by the state land commissioner as are provided by law for state oil and gas leases upon filing a written notice of such election with the department. Upon such written notice to the department the lease term and extension provisions and the provisions relating to unit operations and unit agreements shall be deemed amended.  The lease as amended shall include all other provisions, except those providing for rents, contained in the original lease and shall bear the same commencement date as the original lease. The lease as amended shall require the payment in advance of an annual rental of one dollar and fifty cents per acre per year for each year of any extension of the lease beyond the primary term of the lease, except extensions of the primary term based upon the production of oil or gas.

11. Before offering any state lands for lease under sealed bids the department shall determine the tract or tracts into which the lands shall be divided for leasing purposes. Each tract shall contain not less than one quarter section of land and not more than two sections of land, but a tract containing less than one quarter section of land may be leased if the tract is segregated from other state lands not then subject to oil and gas lease. All tracts shall be in reasonably compact form.

12. The department shall reserve the right to reject any and all bids on each offer for lease and to again offer the tract or tracts for lease if the bids received are not acceptable to the department.

13. Before acceptance of any bid for a lease under this section, the department shall establish to its satisfaction the responsibility of the bidder.

14. The department shall return all checks accompanying rejected bids.

 

#### Section 27-557. Unit operations; unit agreements

A. Each lease issued under the provisions of this article shall provide that the lessee, insofar as its interest in the lease is affected, may join in cooperative or unit plans for the exploration, development and operation of oil and gas pools with the United States, its agencies and its or their lessees and permittees, or with private owners and persons holding oil and gas leases on private lands or on state lands.

B. Lessees under oil and gas leases issued by the department may, with the consent of the department, commit the state lands to unit, cooperative or other plans of exploration, development and operation with other state, federal, private or Indian lands.

C. The state land commissioner shall, not later than ten days after the date a proposed cooperative or unit plan for the exploration, development or operation of oil and gas pools is filed with the department, give notice in writing of such proposal to the oil and gas conservation commission, the bureau of geology and mineral technology and all holders of oil and gas leases on state lands to be included in the proposed cooperative or unit plan. Any interested person may, within ten days after the date of such notice, file a written protest with the department. Upon receipt of such a protest, the state land commissioner shall, not later than thirty days after receipt of the protest, hold a public hearing at the county seat of the county in which the state lands to be included in the proposed cooperative or unit plan are located. Notice of the public hearing shall be published three times in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, the last publication to be not less than ten days prior to the date of the hearing. The state land commissioner shall, not later than sixty days after the date the proposed cooperative or unit plan is filed with the department or, in the event of a protest and public hearing, not later than thirty days after the date of such public hearing, determine whether it is in the best interests of the state to commit state lands to the cooperative or unit plan as proposed or as modified. A proposed cooperative or unit plan may be modified in a manner agreeable to the state land commissioner and the proponent of the plan after such notice and public hearing as may be required by this subsection. Upon determination by the state land commissioner that it is in the best interests of the state to commit state lands to such cooperative or unit plan, the state land commissioner shall consent to and approve the cooperative or unit plan.

D. The execution by the authorized state officer of a cooperative plan or unit agreement is deemed to be an amendment of state leases committed to such plan or unit and has the effect of extending the term of the state leases included in the plan or agreement for the full period of time such plan or unit may remain in effect and of modifying such leases so as to conform the terms and conditions of the leases to the terms and conditions of the plan or unit but otherwise to remain in effect.

E. The agreements shall provide for the equitable division on an agreed basis of the oil and gas produced from the unit and for the extension of leases covering any part of the unit as long as drilling, completion or reworking operations are conducted anywhere on the unit or as long as oil or gas in paying quantities is produced from any part of the unit, but no such agreement shall relieve any operator from the obligation to develop reasonably the lands and leases as a whole committed thereto. When the agreements provide for returning gas to a formation underlying the unit, they may provide that no royalties are required to be paid on the gas returned.

F. Any lease issued under this article which is committed to a unit agreement embracing lands that are in part within and in part outside of the area covered by any such agreement shall be segregated into separate leases as to the lands committed and the lands not committed as of the effective date of unitization. Any such lease, as to the nonunitized portion, shall continue in force and effect for a period of time equal to the greater of the remainder of the original term of the lease or two years from the date of such segregation and as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.

G. Any lease issued under this article which is in effect at the termination of any unit agreement to which such lease is committed, unless relinquished, shall continue in effect for a period of time equal to the greater of the remainder of the original term of the lease or two years from the termination of the unit agreement and as long thereafter as oil or gas is produced in paying quantities.

H. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no lease issued or amended pursuant to this article shall be extended for any term longer than as provided in article X, section 3 of the Constitution of the state of Arizona.

#### Section 27-558. Conservation laws

The development of oil and gas leases issued pursuant to this article shall be in accordance with the laws of the state relating to the conservation of oil and gas.

#### Section 27-559. Development of water for use in operations; taking over well which yields fresh water

A. A lessee shall have the right to develop water for use in its operations subject to the applicable laws of the state pertaining to drilling water wells and using water produced therefrom.

B. If any well drilled for oil or gas on a lease issued pursuant to this article fails to develop oil or gas in paying quantities but develops fresh water, the department shall have the option to take over the well if the lessee determines to abandon it as an oil or gas well upon payment by the department to the lessee of the reasonable value of the well casing and other materials necessary to be left in the well, and the lessee shall thereupon be relieved of all further obligations with respect to the well, its completion and abandonment.

#### Section 27-560. Surface use by lessee; liability for damages; bond; appraisal of damages; appeal

The lessee shall have the right to use as much of the surface of the lands as reasonably necessary for its operations under the lease. The lessee shall be liable for damage caused by it to the state's interest in the surface or to the interest of the surface lessee, if any, and may be required by the department at any time to execute a bond in a reasonable principal amount conditioned upon payment for all such damage. If the lessee and the surface lessee cannot agree on the amount of damage, it shall be appraised by the department or its agent. Appeal from the appraisal may be taken as provided in section 37-214.

#### Section 27-561. Assignment of lease; recording

A. In event of the assignment of a lease as to a segregated portion of the land covered thereby, the rentals payable thereunder shall be apportionable between the several leasehold owners ratably according to the surface area of each. Default in rental payment by one shall not affect the rights of other leasehold owners under the lease. If the lease is assigned in whole or in part, liability for the breach of any obligation under the lease shall rest exclusively upon the owner of the lease or the portion thereof who commits the breach.

B. All leases issued under the provisions of this article shall be assignable in whole or in part, but any assignment of a part of a lease shall cover not less than a quarter of a quarter section or the approximate equivalent thereof.

C. All assignments shall be on forms prescribed by the department and shall be filed with the department within ninety days from the date when made by depositing a duplicate executed original or a copy thereof certified by a notary public. The department shall retain in its files executed duplicate originals of all issued leases and of all assignments deposited with it. All leases and assignments shall be recorded, as other leases are recorded, in tract books kept for that purpose by the department.

D. All leases on file and all assignments filed with the department shall be constructive notice to all persons of the contents thereof.

#### Section 27-562. Surrender

A lessee may surrender any part or all of the lands covered by the lease at any time upon payment to the department of all amounts then due as to the lands surrendered, but no refund of any part of the cash consideration or rental theretofore paid shall be made to the lessee upon such surrender.

#### Section 27-563. Payment of noncompetitive lease royalties in kind or cash

Royalties payable to this state under section 27-555, subsection B are payable in kind or in cash at the option and demand of the department.  The lessee shall pay royalties in cash unless the department elects to receive royalty oil in kind pursuant to this article. The commissioner shall base this determination on what is in the best interest of the trust.

#### Section 27-564. Receipt and sale of royalty oil

A. The department on its initiative and with the approval of the selection board may elect to receive royalty oil in kind from a lessee in lieu of a cash royalty, and the department may resell such royalty oil in the manner provided by the selection board.

#### Section 27-664. Cooperative development agreements; unitization

Whenever the commission finds that it is in the interest of the protection of the geothermal resources of this state from unreasonable waste, the lessors, lessees, operators, owners or other persons holding or controlling royalty or other interest in separate properties within the same productive or prospectively productive geothermal area may, with the approval of the commission, enter into agreement for the purpose of bringing about the cooperation, development and operation of all or a portion of the geothermal resources area as a unit, or for the purpose of fixing the time, location and manner of drilling and operating of wells for the production of geothermal resources within such area or portion thereof. Any such agreement shall bind the successors and assigns of the parties thereto and shall be enforceable by the parties thereto by an action for a specific performance. No such agreement, when approved by the commission, shall be held to violate any of the statutes of this state prohibiting monopolies or acts, arrangements, agreements, contracts, combinations or conspiracies in restraint of trade or commerce. Property rights, leases, contracts and all other rights and obligations shall be regarded as amended and modified to the extent necessary to conform to the provisions and requirements of this section.

#### Section 27-665. Unitization; requirements

A. No order of the commission creating a unit and prescribing the plan of unitization applicable thereto shall become effective unless and until the plan of unitization has been signed, or in writing ratified or approved by the owner or lessees of record of not less than sixty-three per cent of the unit area affected thereby and by owners of record of not less than sixty-three per cent, exclusive of royalty interest owned by lessees or by subsidiaries of any lessee, of the royalty interest in and to the unit area, and the commission has made a finding either in the order creating the unit or in a supplemental order that the plan of unitization has been so signed, ratified or approved by the owner, lessees or royalty owners owning the required percentage interest in and to the unit area.  Where the plan of unitization has not been so signed, ratified or approved by the owner, lessees or royalty owners owning the required percentage interest in and to the unit area at the time the order creating the unit is made, the commission shall, upon petition and notice, hold such additional and supplemental hearings as may be requested or required to determine if and when the plan of unitization has been so signed, ratified or approved by owner, lessees or royalty owners owning the required percentage interest in and to the unit area and shall, in respect to such hearings, make and enter a finding of its determination in such regard. If the owner, lessees or royalty owners owning the required percentage interest in and to the unit area have not so signed, ratified or approved the plan of unitization within a period of six months from and after the date on which the order creating the unit is made, the order creating the unit shall cease to be of further force and effect and shall be revoked by the commission.

B. An order providing for unit operations may be amended by an order made by the commission, in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as an original order providing for unit operations, provided:

1. If such an amendment affects only the rights and interests of the owners, the approval of the amendment by the royalty owners shall not be required.

2. No such order of amendment shall change the percentage for allocation of geothermal resources as established for any separately owned tract by the original order, except with the consent of all persons owning interest in such tract.

C. The commission, by an order, may provide for the unit operation of a pool or a part thereof that embraces a unit area established by a previous order of the commission. Such order, in providing for the allocation of unit production, shall first treat the unit area previously established as a single tract, and the portion of the unit production so allocated thereto shall then be allocated among the separately owned tracts included in such previously established unit area in the same proportions as those specified in the previous order.

#### Section 27-666. Pooling

A. When two or more separately owned tracts of land are embraced within an established drilling unit, persons owning the drilling rights therein and the right to share in the production therefrom may agree to pool their interests and develop their lands as a drilling unit. If the persons do not agree to pool their interests, the commission may, upon application of one or more owners within the drilling unit in question and for prevention of waste, for protection of correlative rights, or to avoid drilling of unnecessary wells, enter an order pooling and integrating their interests for the development of their lands as a drilling unit.  Orders effectuating such pooling shall be made after notice and hearing, and shall be upon terms and conditions which will afford the owner of each tract the opportunity to recover or receive his just and equitable share of the geothermal resources in the pool without unnecessary expense.  Operations incident to drilling a well upon any portion of a unit covered by a pooling order shall be deemed for all purposes to be the conduct of such operations upon each separately owned tract in the unit by the several owners thereof. The portion of the production allocated to the owner of each tract included in a drilling unit formed by a pooling order shall, when produced, be considered as if it had been produced from the tract by a well drilled thereon. If such pooling is effectuated, the cost of development and operation of the pooled unit chargeable by the operator to other interested owners shall be limited to the actual and reasonable expenditures required for that purpose, including a reasonable charge for supervision. As to owners who refuse to agree upon pooling, the order shall provide for reimbursement for costs chargeable to each such owner out of, and only out of, production from the unit belonging to such owner. In event of dispute relative to such costs, the commission shall, upon notice to all interested parties and hearing thereon, determine the proper costs.  Appeals may be taken from the determination as from any other order of the commission. If one or more of the owners drills and operates, or pays the expense of drilling and operating the well for the benefit of others, then, in addition to any other rights conferred by the pooling order, the owner or owners so drilling or operating shall have a lien on the share of production from the unit accruing to the interest of each of the other owners for the payment of his proportionate share of the expenses. All the geothermal production subject to the lien, or so much thereof as necessary, shall be marketed and sold by the creditor and the proceeds applied in payment of the expenses secured by the lien, with the balance if any payable to the debtor.

B. The commission shall, in all instances where a unit has been formed from lands or areas of more than one ownership, require the operator, upon request of an owner, but subject to the right of the operator to market production and collect the proceeds with respect to an owner in default, as provided in subsection A.

C. If the persons owning and drilling or exercising other rights in separate tracts embraced within a drilling unit fail to agree upon the pooling of the tracts and drilling of a well on the unit, and if the commission is without authority to require pooling as provided by this section, then, subject to all other applicable provisions of this article, the owner of each tract embraced within the drilling unit may drill on his tract, but the allowable production from the tract shall be the proportion of the allowable production for the full drilling unit as the area of such separately owned tract bears to the full drilling unit.

#### Section 27-667. Relationship of geothermal resources to water laws

A. Geothermal resources and their development shall be exempt from the water laws of this state unless either:

1. Such resources are commingled with surface waters or groundwaters of this state.

2. Such development causes impairment of or damage to the groundwater supply.

B. In the development of geothermal resources, any well drilled to obtain and use groundwater, as defined in section 45-101, shall be subject to the water laws of this state.

C. An operator shall notify the director of water resources of any well which is drilled or abandoned. The director may prescribe rules and regulations relating to the disposition of abandoned wells.

The determinations and designations shall be published twice in a newspaper of general circulation in this state, the last publication to be not less than five days from the first date of publication. The determinations and designations shall become effective from the date of first publication. Until such a determination and designation is made by the department, all state lands shall be deemed not located within any known geothermal resource area.

#### Section 27-670. Lease of state lands; application; call for bids; publication; withdrawal of lands from leasing

A. Applications for leases shall be in writing addressed to the department and shall contain a description of the lands sufficient to identify them, the name and address of the applicant and shall be accompanied by a filing fee of twenty-five dollars. Each application shall be stamped when received by the department with a stamp showing the day and hour when received.

B. Before offering any state lands for lease the department shall determine the tract or tracts into which the lands shall be divided for leasing purposes. All tracts shall be in reasonably compact form.

C. Upon receipt of an application to lease any state lands, the department shall offer the tract or tracts for lease to the highest and best bidder. The bidding shall be on the basis of highest first year's bonus to be paid to the department at the time of declaration of the highest and best bidder.

D. The department shall publish a call for bids in the same manner provided for the sale of state lands. On or before December 1 each year, the department shall designate by general order the newspaper at the capital in which the publications shall be made during the following calendar year. The successful bidder shall pay the cost of the publication and the reasonable expenses of the sale.

E. The publication shall contain a description of the land proposed to be leased, the time when the bids will be received, the royalty to be demanded which the department shall fix prior to call for bids and an annual rental to be demanded.

F. The publication shall set forth the form of lease which the successful bidder will be required to execute. In lieu of publishing the form of lease in its entirety the publication may specify the form of lease by designating the form number of the lease on file with the department, copies of which shall be furnished any person on request.

G. Each offer for lease shall reserve the right in the department to reject any and all bids and to again offer the tract or tracts for lease if the bids received are not acceptable to the department.

H. No bid may be accepted unless the bidder, or the bidder's disclosed principal, qualifies under the provisions of section 37-240, subsection B.

I. The department may withdraw from leasing any specific area of land if it appears that the withdrawal is in the interest of this state.

J. The department may refuse to lease any state lands for development of geothermal resources and may refuse to sell geothermal resource leases when such refusal is deemed by the department to be in the best interest of the state.

K. The department shall return all checks accompanying rejected bids.

D. The leases shall contain other terms and provisions, not inconsistent with the provisions of this article or other laws of this state, as in the opinion of the department are for the best interest of this state.

E. Not more than two thousand five hundred sixty acres of land shall be included in any one lease. The leased lands shall be in as compact a body as possible but may include noncontiguous land.

F. Each lease shall provide that any combination, understanding or agreement entered into by the lessee, written, verbal or otherwise, for the purpose of delaying discovery or development of geothermal resources is an illegal practice, and that upon legal determination of such practice shall constitute grounds for cancellation of the lease. Appropriate proceedings shall be instituted by the attorney general against the lessee in the county in which the land or any part of such land is located. The provisions of this section shall not apply to a unit plan or operation entered into under the provisions of this article or to any plan or operation authorized by any conservation law of this state.

#### Section 27-672. Unit operations; unit agreements

A. Each lease issued under the provisions of this article shall provide that the lessee, insofar as its interest is affected, may join, with the department's prior written approval, in cooperative or unit plans for the development and operation of geothermal resource pools with the United States, its agencies and its or their lessees and permittees and with private owners and persons holding geothermal resource leases on private lands or on state lands.

B. Upon determination by the department that it is in the best interests of the state to commit state lands to a cooperative or unit plan for the development and operation of geothermal resource pools, the department may, insofar as the state royalties may be affected thereby, join in and consent to any such plan on behalf of the state. The agreements shall provide for the equitable division on an agreed basis of the geothermal resource produced from the unit and for the extension of leases covering any part of the unit so long as geothermal resources in paying quantities are produced from any part of the unit. No such agreement shall relieve any operator from the obligation to develop reasonably the lands and leases as a whole nor shall such agreement relieve the lessee of the obligation to pay to the department the royalty provided for in the lease.

#### Section 27-673. Surface use by lessee; liability for damages; bond; appraisal of damages; appeal

The lessee shall have the right to use as much of the surface of the lands as reasonably necessary for its operations under the lease as determined by the department. The lessee shall be liable for damage caused by it to the state's interest in the surface and to the interest of the surface lessee, if any, and may be required by the department at any time to execute a bond in a reasonable principal amount to be released upon payment for all such damage and for reclamation of the surface. If the lessee and the surface lessee cannot agree on the amount of damage, it shall be appraised by the department or its agent. Appeal from the appraisal may be taken as provided in section 37-214.

#### Section 27-674. Assignment of lease; recording

A. In event of the assignment of a lease as to a segregated portion of the land, the rentals payable shall be apportioned between the portions according to the surface area of each. If the lease is assigned in whole or in part, liability for the breach of any obligation under the lease shall rest exclusively upon the owner of the lease or portion thereof who commits the breach.

B. All leases issued under the provisions of this article may be assignable in whole or in part. Assignments may not be made without the prior written approval of the department.
