F. The board may require that the licensee under investigation undergo any mental and physical examination and may conduct any investigation, including the taking of depositions, necessary to fully inform itself with respect to the complaint.

G.

E. The bonds or deposit required by subsection B of this section are for the benefit of and are subject to claims by the registrar of contractors for failure to pay any sum required pursuant to this chapter.  The bond or deposit required by subsection B, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this section is for the benefit of and subject to claims by a licensee under this chapter or a lessee, owner or co-owner of nonresidential real property including, but not limited to, a tenant in common or joint tenant, or their successors in interest, who has a direct contract with the licensee against whose bond or deposit the claim is made and who is damaged by the failure of the licensee to build or improve a structure or appurtenance on that real property at the time the work was performed in a manner not in compliance with the requirements of any building or construction code applicable to the construction work under the laws of this state or any political subdivision, or if no such code was applicable, in accordance with the standards of construction work approved by the registrar. The residential bond or deposit required by subsection B, paragraphs 4 through 8 of this section is for the benefit of and subject to claims by any person furnishing labor, materials or construction equipment on a rental basis used in the direct performance of a construction contract involving a residential structure or by claimants as described in section 32-1132. The bond or deposit required by subsection C, paragraph 1 of this section is for the benefit of and is subject to claims only by claimants as described in section  32-1132. The person seeking recovery from the bond or cash deposit shall maintain an action at law against the contractor if claiming against the cash deposit or against the contractor and surety if claiming against the surety bond. If the person seeking recovery is required to give the notice pursuant to section 33-992.01, he is entitled to seek recovery only if he has given such notice and has made proof of service. The surety bond or cash deposit is subject to claims until the full amount thereof is exhausted. The court may award reasonable attorney fees in a judgment against a contractor's surety bond or cash deposit. A suit may not be commenced on the bond or for satisfaction from the cash deposit after the expiration of two years following the commission of the act or delivery of goods or rendering of services on which the suit is based, except that time for purposes of claims for fraud is measured as provided in section 12-543. The surety bond or cash deposit shall be continuous in form and conditioned so that the total aggregate liability of the surety or cash deposit for all claims, including reasonable attorney fees, is limited to the face amount of the surety bond or cash deposit irrespective of the number of years the bond or cash deposit is in force. If the corporate surety desires to make payment without awaiting court or registrar action, the amount of any bond filed in compliance with this chapter shall be reduced to the extent of any payment or payments made by the corporate surety in good faith thereunder. Any such payments shall be based on priority of written claims received by the corporate surety before court or registrar action. If more than one cash deposit exists, the judgment against the contractor shall state which cash deposit is used to satisfy the judgment. A certified copy of the judgment shall then be filed with the registrar, and such judgment must specify that it may be satisfied from the contractor's cash deposit. Priority for payment is based on the time of filing with the registrar. On receipt of a certified copy of the judgment or on a final disciplinary order of the registrar, the registrar may authorize payment from the cash deposit of the amount claimed or of whatever lesser amount remains on file. In any action against a cash deposit, the claimant, at the time of filing suit, may notify the registrar in writing of the action against the cash deposit, but may not name as a defendant in the action the registrar, the treasurer or the state. A claimant's failure to notify the registrar at the time of filing suit may result in the cash deposit being withdrawn by the licensee before judgment pursuant to subsection D of this section.

F. When a corporate surety cancels a bond, the surety, not less than thirty days before the effective date of the cancellation, shall give the principal and the registrar a written notice of the cancellation. Notice to the principal shall be by certified mail in a sealed envelope with postage fully prepaid. Proof of notice to the principal shall be made available to the registrar on request. On reduction or depletion of the cash deposit, the registrar shall immediately notify the licensee of said reduction or depletion and that the licensee must replenish the cash deposit or furnish a surety bond on or before thirty days from the date of said reduction or depletion or the contractor's license is suspended on the thirtieth day without further notice or hearing. Notice to the contractor shall be by certified mail in a sealed envelope with postage fully prepaid thereon, addressed to the contractor's latest address of record in the registrar's office. The contractor's license is suspended by operation of law on the date the bond is canceled or thirty days from the date of reduction or depletion of the cash deposit unless a replacement bond or cash deposit is on file with the registrar.

G. The registrar and the state treasurer have no personal liability for the performance of duties relating to the bonds, cash deposits, certificates of deposit, investment certificates or share accounts required or permitted by this chapter as long as such duties are performed in good faith.

H. In the following instances the registrar, after a hearing, may require, as a condition precedent to issuance, renewal, continuation or removal of suspension of a license, a surety bond or cash deposit in an amount and duration to be fixed by the registrar based on the seriousness of the violations, which may not be more than ten times the amount required by subsection B of this section:

1. When a license of either the applicant or the qualifying party has been suspended or revoked or a surety bond or cash deposit requirement has been increased under section 32-1154 previously as the result of disciplinary action for a violation of this chapter.

2. When either the applicant or qualifying party was an officer, member, partner or qualifying party for a licensee at any time during which cause for disciplinary action occurred resulting in suspension or revocation of such licensee's license and such applicant or qualifying party had knowledge of or participated in the act or omission that was the cause of such disciplinary action for a violation of this chapter.

#### Section 32-1183. Performance and payment by contractor, subcontractor or material supplier; conditions; interest

A. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this article, performance by a contractor, subcontractor or material supplier in accordance with the provisions of a construction contract entitles the contractor, subcontractor or material supplier to payment from the party with whom the contractor, subcontractor or material supplier contracts.

B. If a subcontractor or material supplier has performed in accordance with the provisions of a construction contract, the contractor shall pay to its subcontractors or material suppliers and each subcontractor shall pay to its subcontractors or material suppliers, within seven days of receipt by the contractor or subcontractor of each progress payment, retention release or final payment, the full amount received for such subcontractor's work and materials supplied based on work completed or materials supplied under the subcontract. Payment shall not be required pursuant to this subsection unless the subcontractor or material supplier provides to the contractor or subcontractor a billing or invoice for the work performed or material supplied in accordance with the terms of the construction contract between the parties. Each subcontractor or material supplier shall provide a waiver of any mechanic's or materialman's lien conditioned on payment for the work completed or material supplied. The contractor or subcontractor may require that such conditional waivers of lien be notarized.  Any diversion by the contractor or subcontractor of payments received for work performed pursuant to a contract, or failure to reasonably account for the application or use of such payments, constitutes grounds for disciplinary action by the registrar of contractors.  Violations of this section shall be grounds for suspension or revocation of a license or other disciplinary action by the registrar pursuant to section 32-1154, subsections B, C and D. The subcontractor or material supplier may notify the registrar of contractors and the owner in writing of any payment less than the amount or percentage approved for the class or item of work as set forth in this section.

C. Nothing in this section prevents the contractor or subcontractor, at the time of application or certification to the owner or contractor, from withholding such application or certification to the owner or contractor for payment to the subcontractor or material supplier for any of the following reasons:

1. Unsatisfactory job progress.

2. Defective construction work or materials not remedied.

3. Disputed work or materials.

4. Failure to comply with other material provisions of the construction contract.

5. Third-party claims filed or reasonable evidence that a claim will be filed.

6. Failure of the subcontractor to make timely payments for labor, equipment and materials.

7. Damage to a contractor or another subcontractor or material supplier.

8. Reasonable evidence that the subcontract cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract sum.

9. The owner has withheld retention from the contractor, in which case the amount of the retention withholding by the contractor shall not exceed the actual amount of the retention retained by the owner pertaining to the subcontractor's work.

D. A contractor or subcontractor shall not withhold retention from a subcontractor in an amount greater than the actual amount of the retention retained by the owner pertaining to the work of the subcontractor.

E. If the contractor or subcontractor chooses to withhold the application or certification for all or a portion of a subcontractor's or material supplier's billing or estimates as permitted by subsection C of this section, the contractor or subcontractor must prepare and issue a written statement within fourteen days to the applicable subcontractors or material suppliers stating in reasonable detail the contractor's or subcontractor's reasons for withholding the application or certification from the owner or contractor.

F. If the owner issues a written statement pursuant to section  32-1182, subsection D, H or K stating that the owner declines to certify or approve all or a portion of the contractor's billing or estimate and if the amounts to be paid from that billing or estimate by the contractor to any subcontractors or material suppliers are affected by the owner's decision not to certify or approve, the contractor shall send a copy of that written statement within seven days after receipt to any affected subcontractors or material suppliers.  If the contractor sends a copy of the owner's written statement to a subcontractor and if the amounts to be paid from that billing or estimate by a subcontractor to any of its subcontractors or material suppliers are affected by the owner's decision not to certify or approve, then the subcontractor shall send a copy of that written statement within seven days after receipt to any of its affected subcontractors or material suppliers.

G. If the owner issues a written statement pursuant to section  32-1182, subsection D, H or K stating that the owner declines to certify or approve a billing or estimate or a portion of a billing or estimate for defective construction work or materials not remedied and if the contractor as a result does not receive sufficient payment from the owner to pay subcontractors and material suppliers for work included in the contractor's billing or estimate, the contractor shall nevertheless pay any subcontractor or material supplier whose work was not the basis of the owner's withholding for defective construction work or materials not remedied within twenty-one days after payment would otherwise have been made by the owner under section  32-1182, subsection A. This subsection does not limit a subcontractor's rights to suspend performance under a construction contract or terminate a construction contract under section 32-1185, subsection D.

H. If a progress or final payment or release of retention to a subcontractor or material supplier is delayed by more than seven days after receipt of progress or final payment or release of retention by the contractor or subcontractor pursuant to this section, the contractor or subcontractor shall pay its subcontractor or material supplier interest, except for periods of time during which payment is withheld pursuant to subsection C of this section, beginning on the eighth day, at the rate of one and one-half percent per month or a fraction of a month on the unpaid balance or at such higher rate as the parties agree.

I. Any licensed contractor, licensed subcontractor or material supplier who files a complaint with the registrar of contractors under this section shall be required to post a surety bond or cash deposit of $500 or one-half of the amount due, whichever is less, with the registrar to secure the payment of claims under this section. If the complaint is determined by the registrar to be without merit and frivolous, the registrar shall order the person who filed the complaint to pay one-half of the amount of the required surety bond or cash deposit to the respondent and one-half to the registrar for deposit into the state general fund.  If no claim may be made under this section against the surety bond or cash deposit, the surety bond or cash deposit shall be returned to the complainant. The surety bond or cash deposit shall be in the name of the licensee or material supplier who files the complaint and shall be subject to claims by the registrar of contractors and the respondent licensee as provided in this section.  The surety bond or cash deposit shall be conditioned on and provide for payment on the presentation of a certified copy of the order of the registrar and a certification by the complainant of nonpayment within thirty days after the order becomes final. The surety bond shall be executed by the complainant as principal with a corporation duly authorized to transact surety business in this state. Evidence of the surety bond shall be submitted to the registrar in a form acceptable to the registrar. The cash deposit shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, by the registrar in the contractors prompt pay complaint fund and shall be held for the payment of claims.

J. In any action or arbitration brought to collect payments or interest pursuant to this section, the successful party shall be awarded costs and attorney fees in a reasonable amount.

However, in order to do so, you must issue a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail your reasons for withholding payments within fourteen (14) days after the date you receive a billing or estimate.  If you fail to issue the written statement within that period, the billing or estimate will be deemed approved. Once the billing or estimate is deemed approved, you must pay the billing or estimate within seven (7) days. Generally, you are limited by the act to withholding only an amount that is sufficient to pay the direct costs and expenses you reasonably expect to incur to protect you from loss for which the contractor is responsible.  You are encouraged to read the act in full to know your obligations and rights.

This section does not mandate that a crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment cremate or otherwise provide for the lawful disposition of a dead human body pursuant to the document unless the legally competent adult who executed the document made any financial arrangements necessary to effectuate the legally competent adult's wishes as expressed in the document.

E. A crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment that cremates or otherwise provides for the lawful disposition of a dead human body in good faith reliance on an apparently genuine document executed pursuant to this section is immune from criminal and civil liability and is not subject to professional discipline. The decision of a crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment to cremate or otherwise provide for the lawful disposition of a dead human body in reliance on a document executed pursuant to this section is presumed to be made in good faith.

#### Section 32-1365.02. Authorizing agents; consent for cremation, disinterment or embalming; definition

A. Except as provided in section 32-1365.01 and in subsection E of this section, it is unlawful to cremate or disinter a dead human body without prior written consent of the authorizing agent.

B. Except as provided in section 32-1365.01, it is unlawful to embalm a dead human body without prior oral or written consent of the authorizing agent.

C. A funeral establishment shall create a written record of an oral consent given pursuant to this section that includes all of the following:

1. The name of the authorizing agent.

2. The relation of the authorizing agent to the deceased.

3. The date and time that consent was given.

4. The name of the person who obtained the consent.

5. Any other information required by the board.

D. In determining who the proper authorizing agent is, the order of preference is the same as provided in section 36-831. If there is more than one member in a category listed in section 36-831 entitled to serve as the authorizing agent, final arrangements may be made by any member of that category unless that member knows of an objection by another member of the category.  If an objection is known, final arrangements shall be made by a majority of the members of the category who are reasonably available.

E. On the order of a court or a county medical examiner, or a person performing the duties of a county medical examiner, a dead human body shall be disinterred.

F. If none of the persons listed in section 36-831 is willing or financially capable of providing for the cremation or embalming of a dead human body, the public fiduciary or other person who is designated by the county in which a death occurs to handle funeral arrangements may order the cremation or embalming.

G. A funeral establishment, an employee or agent of a funeral establishment or a licensee shall exercise due diligence to obtain the consent required pursuant to this section from the proper authorizing agent. It is an affirmative defense to any action or claim brought against a crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment relating to the disposition of a dead human body that the crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment relied in good faith on the direction of a person who claimed to be the authorizing agent in providing for the lawful disposition of a dead human body.  The decision of a crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment to cremate or otherwise provide for the lawful disposition of a dead human body in reliance on the direction of a person who claims to be the authorizing agent is presumed to be in good faith unless the crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment has actual knowledge that the claim is false.

H. If the authorizing agent is not reasonably available or unable to act as the authorizing agent, the person's right to be the authorizing agent shall pass to the next person or category of persons in the order of preference prescribed in section 36-831.

I. It is presumed that the authorizing agent is not reasonably available to act as authorizing agent if the crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment after exercising due diligence has been unable to contact the individual or if that person has been unwilling or unable to make final arrangements for the disposition of the decedent within fifteen days after the initial contact by the crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment. If a person in a prior category makes an initial contact with the crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment or becomes able before the final disposition of the decedent, that person resumes that person's right to serve as the authorizing agent.

J. Any dispute among any of the persons listed in section 36-831, subsection A concerning the right to control the disposition, including cremation, of a decedent's remains shall be resolved by the parties to the dispute or by a court of competent jurisdiction in order to expedite the resolution of a dispute among the parties.  A crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment shall not be liable for refusing to accept the decedent's remains or inter, cremate or otherwise dispose of a decedent's remains until it receives a court order or other suitable confirmation that the dispute has been resolved or settled.  A crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment may bring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction in order to expedite the resolution of a dispute among the parties listed in section 36-831, subsection A.

K. For the purposes of this section "reasonably available" means a person who is able to be contacted by the crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment without undue effort and who is willing and able to act within fifteen days after the initial contact by the crematory, cemetery or funeral establishment.

#### Section 32-1367. Investigations; initial review; disciplinary proceedings; civil penalty; letters of concern; rehearings

A. The board shall conduct an investigation when it receives a written complaint that appears to show the existence of any grounds for disciplinary action under this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.

B. The board on its own initiative may investigate any information that appears to show the existence of any grounds for disciplinary action under this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.

C. If it appears after an initial investigation that grounds for disciplinary action may exist, the board may either request an informal interview with the licensee or registrant or may issue a notice of a formal hearing.  If the initial investigation indicates that suspension other than a temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection D of this section or revocation of a license, registration or endorsement may be warranted, the board shall schedule a formal hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

D. After completing an informal interview, the board may take any or all of the following disciplinary actions:

1. Issue a letter of censure or reprimand.

2. Impose probationary terms as the board deems necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare and to rehabilitate or educate the licensee or registrant.  Probationary terms imposed pursuant to this paragraph may include temporary suspension of a license, registration or endorsement for a period of not more than thirty days, restriction of the licensee's or registrant's right to practice pursuant to this chapter and a requirement that restitution be made to any funeral service consumer or other person who was injured by a violation of this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter.  A licensee's or registrant's failure to comply with any probationary terms imposed pursuant to this paragraph is cause for the board to consider the entire case against the licensee or registrant and any other alleged violations of this chapter at a formal hearing.

3. Impose a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars for each violation.

E. After completing a formal hearing, the board may take any or all of the following disciplinary actions:

5. Revoke a license, registration or endorsement.

F. If, as a result of information ascertained during an investigation, informal interview or formal hearing, the board determines that an alleged violation of this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter is not sufficiently serious to warrant disciplinary action, the board may issue a letter of concern to the licensee or registrant.  The letter of concern shall advise the licensee or registrant of the possible violation.

G. If a licensee or registrant refuses to participate in an informal interview or a formal hearing, the board may take any or all of the disciplinary actions listed in subsections D and E of this section.

H. Before the board may revoke or suspend a license, registration or endorsement, other than a temporary suspension imposed pursuant to subsection D of this section, the board shall serve notice and conduct a hearing in the manner prescribed in title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

I. After service of notice of a decision of the board suspending or revoking a license, registration or endorsement or imposing a disciplinary action on a licensee or registrant pursuant to subsection D or E of this section, a licensee may apply for a rehearing or review by filing a motion pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  The filing of a motion for a rehearing or review suspends the operation of the board's decision to impose a disciplinary action and allows the licensee or registrant to continue to practice pending a denial or granting of the petition and pending the decision of the board on rehearing if a rehearing is granted.  The board also may grant a rehearing on its own motion if it finds newly discovered evidence or for any other reason that justifies a reconsideration of a matter.

J. Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, any party who is aggrieved by a final order or decision of the board may appeal to the superior court pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

K. All notices that the board is required to provide to any person under this chapter are fully effective by personal service or by mailing a copy of the notice by certified mail addressed to the person's last known address of record in the board's files.  Notice by mail is complete at the time of its deposit in the mail.

L. In addition to the requirements of subsection K of this section, a funeral establishment or crematory shall file a notice with the board identifying the person on whom the board's notices relating to the funeral establishment or crematory shall be served.

#### Section 32-1368. Administrative costs

On its determination that a licensee or registrant has violated a provision of this chapter or a rule adopted pursuant to this chapter, the board may assess the licensee or registrant its administrative costs and expenses incurred in conducting the investigation and its administrative costs and expenses incurred in connection with the informal interview or formal hearing. The board may assess these administrative costs and expenses in addition to any civil penalties imposed pursuant to section 32-1367. The board shall deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, all monies collected pursuant to this section in the board of funeral directors' and embalmers' fund to defray the board's expenses in connection with disciplinary investigations and hearings. Notwithstanding section 35-143.01, these monies may be spent on investigations and hearings without legislative appropriation.

 

#### Section 32-1369. Cease and desist orders; injunctive relief

A. In addition to all other remedies, if it appears to the board, either on complaint or otherwise, that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any act, practice or transaction that constitutes a violation of this chapter, of title 44, chapter 10, article 7 or of any rule adopted pursuant to this chapter, the board may either:

1. Serve a cease and desist order on the person by certified mail or personal service requiring the person to cease and desist immediately from engaging in the act, practice or transaction.

2. Apply, through the attorney general or county attorney of the county in which the act, practice or transaction is alleged to have been committed, to the superior court in that county for an injunction restraining the person from engaging in the act, practice or transaction or doing any act in furtherance of the act, practice or transaction.  On a proper showing, the court shall grant a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction or a permanent injunction without bond.  Process in an action under this paragraph may be served on the defendant in any county of this state where the defendant transacts business or is found.

The board shall adopt rules that establish standards equivalent to section 32-1307, subsection A, paragraph 5 for regulating crematories and cremation and that include the following:

1. A crematory shall develop, implement and maintain a written procedure for the identification of human remains that ensures that remains can be identified from the time that a crematory accepts the delivery of the remains until the cremated remains are released to the authorizing agent. The identification procedures shall require the crematory to comply with the requirements of this section. The crematory shall not open a container containing human remains, except under the personal supervision of a licensed funeral director or embalmer or a responsible cremationist licensed pursuant to this article and trained in crematory operations to manage the daily operation of the crematory.  After taking custody of human remains, a crematory shall immediately verify the identification attached to the casket or cremation container and assign an identification number. The crematory shall not accept unidentified caskets or cremation containers. The identification shall include the name and address of the deceased, the name and relationship of the authorizing agent, the name of the person or entity engaging the crematory services, a valid cremation permit issued by a government agency and a metal cremation disk containing the identification number.  The disk shall be placed with the deceased during cremation.

2. If a crematory is unable to cremate the human remains immediately after taking custody, the crematory shall store the remains in a holding facility that is secure from access by anyone other than employees of the crematory and public officials in the performance of their duty and that complies with applicable public health laws, preserves the dignity of the human remains and protects the health of employees of the crematory.

3. A crematory shall not accept a casket or cremation container from which there is evidence of leakage of body fluids from the human remains and shall not hold human remains for cremation unless they are contained in an individual, closed casket or rigid cremation container of combustible material that preserves the dignity of the human remains and that protects the health of employees of the crematory. Human remains that are not embalmed shall be held by the crematory in a refrigerated holding facility that maintains human remains at or below thirty-eight degrees fahrenheit or in compliance with applicable public health laws.

4. All body prostheses, bridgework or similar items removed from the cremated remains shall be disposed of by the crematory unless an alternative disposition is agreed to in the authorization to cremate.

5. After cremation, the crematory as far as practicable shall remove visible parts of the residual of the cremation process from the retort, shall not combine the cremated or processed remains with other cremated or processed remains and shall attach the identification of the cremated or processed remains to the temporary container or urn into which the remains are placed.

6. The crematory shall place cremated or processed remains in a temporary container or urn. Extra space may be filled with clean packing material that will not combine with the cremated or processed remains.  The lid or top shall be securely closed. Any cremated or processed remains that do not fit in the temporary container or urn shall be returned in a separate container or, with permission of the authorizing agent, disposed of by the crematory.

7. A crematory may dispose of cremated or processed remains in any legal manner directed by a document prepared pursuant to section 32-1365.01 or agreed to by the authorizing agent. If the authorizing agent agrees to take possession and does not take possession of the remains within thirty days after cremation or on an agreed date, the crematory shall send written notice to the last known address of the authorizing agent to take possession. Ninety days after the notification is sent or delivered, the crematory may dispose of the cremated or processed remains in any legal manner.

8. Unless the deceased has prepared a document pursuant to section 32-1365.01, the crematory shall obtain an authorization to cremate from the authorizing agent that shall contain a provision holding the crematory harmless for the disposition of unclaimed cremated or processed remains.

9. All employees of the crematory who handle dead human bodies shall use universal precautions and shall otherwise exercise reasonable care to minimize the risk of transmitting any communicable disease from a dead human body.

10. Unless the deceased has prepared a document pursuant to section 32-1365.01, employees of the crematory shall not remove a dead human body from the container in which it is delivered to the crematory without the express written consent of the authorizing agent. If, after accepting a dead human body for cremation, employees of a crematory discover that a mechanical or radioactive device is implanted in the body, an embalmer licensed pursuant to article 2 of this chapter shall remove the device from the body before cremation takes place.

11. A crematory shall keep an accurate record of all cremations performed, including dispositions of cremated and processed remains, for not fewer than five years after the cremation.

#### Section 32-1855. Disciplinary action; duty to report; hearing; notice; independent medical examinations; surrender of license

A. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the board on its own motion may investigate any information that appears to show that an osteopathic physician and surgeon is or may be guilty of unprofessional conduct or is or may be mentally or physically unable safely to engage in the practice of medicine.  A physician who conducts an independent medical examination pursuant to an order by a court or pursuant to section 23-1026 is not subject to a complaint for unprofessional conduct unless, in the case of a court-ordered examination, the complaint is made or referred by a court to the board, or in the case of an examination conducted pursuant to section 23-1026, the complaint alleges unprofessional conduct based on some act other than a disagreement with the findings and opinions expressed by the physician as a result of the examination.  Any osteopathic physician or surgeon or the Arizona osteopathic medical association or any health care institution as defined in section 36-401 shall, and any other person may, report to the board any information the physician or surgeon, association, health care institution or other person may have that appears to show that an osteopathic physician and surgeon is or may be guilty of unprofessional conduct or is or may be mentally or physically unable safely to engage in the practice of medicine. The board shall notify the doctor about whom information has been received as to the content of the information as soon as reasonable after receiving the information. Any person who reports or provides information to the board in good faith is not subject to civil damages as a result of that action. If requested the board shall not disclose the informant's name unless it is essential to the disciplinary proceedings conducted pursuant to this section. It is an act of unprofessional conduct for any osteopathic physician or surgeon to fail to report as required by this section.  The board shall report any health care institution that fails to report as required by this section to that institution's licensing agency.  A person who reports information in good faith pursuant to this subsection is not subject to civil liability. For the purposes of this subsection, "independent medical examination" means a professional analysis of medical status that is based on a person's past and present physical, medical and psychiatric history and conducted by a licensee or group of licensees on a contract basis for a court or for a workers' compensation carrier, self-insured employer or claims processing representative if the examination was conducted pursuant to section 23-1026.

B. The board may require a physician under investigation pursuant to subsection A of this section to be interviewed by the board or its representatives.  The board or the executive director may require a licensee who is under investigation pursuant to subsection A of this section to undergo at the licensee's expense any combination of medical, physical or mental examinations the board finds necessary to determine the physician's competence.

C. If the board finds, based on the information it received under subsection A or B of this section, that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, the board may order a summary suspension of a license pending proceedings for revocation or other action.  If an order of summary suspension is issued, the licensee shall also be served with a written notice of complaint and formal hearing setting forth the charges made against the licensee and is entitled to a formal hearing on the charges pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  Formal proceedings shall be promptly instituted and determined.

D. If, after completing its investigation, the board finds that the information provided pursuant to this section is not of sufficient seriousness to merit direct action against the physician's license, it may take any combination of the following actions:

1. Dismiss if, in the opinion of the board, the information is without merit.

2. Issue a letter of concern.

3. In addition to the requirements of section 32-1825, require continuing medical education on subjects and within a time period determined by the board.

4. Issue a nondisciplinary order requiring the licensee to complete a prescribed number of hours of continuing education in an area or areas prescribed by the board to provide the licensee with the necessary understanding of current developments, skills, procedures or treatment.

E. If, in the opinion of the board, it appears that information provided pursuant to this section is or may be true, the board may request an investigative hearing with the physician concerned. At an investigative hearing the board may receive and consider sworn statements of persons who may be called as witnesses and other pertinent documents. Legal counsel may be present and participate in the meeting. If the physician refuses the request or if the physician accepts the request and the results of the investigative hearing indicate suspension of more than twelve months or revocation of the license may be in order, a complaint shall be issued and an administrative hearing shall be held pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  After the investigative hearing and a mental, physical or medical competence examination as the board deems necessary, the board may take any of the following actions:

1. Dismiss if, in the opinion of the board, the information is without merit.

2. Issue a letter of concern.

3. In addition to the requirements of section 32-1825, require continuing medical education on subjects and within a time period determined by the board.

4. Issue a decree of censure, which constitutes an official action against a physician's license.

5. Fix a period and terms of probation best adapted to protect the public health and safety and rehabilitate or educate the physician concerned. Any costs incidental to the terms of probation are at the physician's own expense.

6. Restrict or limit the physician's practice in a manner and for a time determined by the board.

7. Suspend the physician's license for not more than twelve months.

8. Impose a civil penalty of not to exceed five hundred dollars for each violation of this chapter.

9. Issue a nondisciplinary order requiring the licensee to complete a prescribed number of hours of continuing education in an area or areas prescribed by the board to provide the licensee with the necessary understanding of current developments, skills, procedures or treatment.

10. Issue an administrative warning.

F. If, in the opinion of the board, it appears the charge is of such magnitude as to warrant suspension for more than twelve months or revocation of the license, the board shall immediately initiate formal revocation or suspension proceedings pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10. The board shall notify a licensee of a complaint and hearing by certified mail addressed to the licensee's last known address on record in the board's files.

G. A licensee shall respond in writing to the board within thirty days after the notice of formal or administrative hearing is served.  A licensee who fails to answer the charges in a complaint and notice of formal or administrative hearing issued pursuant to this article and title 41, chapter 6, article 10 is deemed to admit the acts charged in the complaint, and the board may revoke or suspend the license without a hearing.

H. A physician who, after an investigative or administrative hearing, is found to be guilty of unprofessional conduct or is found to be mentally or physically unable safely to engage in the practice of osteopathic medicine is subject to any combination of censure, probation, suspension of license, revocation of license, an order to return patient fees, imposition of hearing costs, imposition of a civil penalty of not to exceed five hundred dollars for each violation for a period of time, or permanently, and under conditions the board deems appropriate for the protection of the public health and safety and just in the circumstances. The board may charge the costs of an investigative or administrative hearing to the licensee if pursuant to that hearing the board determines that the licensee violated this chapter or board rules.

I. If the board acts to modify a physician's prescription writing privileges, it shall immediately notify the state board of pharmacy and the federal drug enforcement administration in the United States department of justice of the modification.

J. The board shall report allegations of evidence of criminal wrongdoing to the appropriate criminal justice agency.

K. Notice of a complaint and administrative hearing is effective when a true copy of the notice is sent by certified mail to the licensee's last known address of record in the board's files and is complete on the date of its deposit in the mail.  The board shall hold an administrative hearing within one hundred twenty days after that date.

L. The board may accept the surrender of an active license from a licensee who admits in writing to having committed an act of unprofessional conduct, to having violated this chapter or board rules or to being unable to safely practice medicine.

C. Any pharmacy personnel shall notify the person presenting the prescription of the amount of the price difference between the brand name drug or biological product prescribed and the generic equivalent drug or interchangeable biological product, if both of the following apply:

1. The medical practitioner does not indicate an intent to prevent substitution with a generic equivalent drug or interchangeable biological product.

2. The transaction is not subject to third-party reimbursement.

D. The pharmacist shall place on the container the name of the drug or biological product dispensed followed by the words "generic equivalent for" or "interchangeable biological product for" followed by the brand or trade name of the product that is being replaced by the generic equivalent drug or interchangeable biological product. The pharmacist shall include the brand or trade name on the container or label of any contact lenses dispensed pursuant to this chapter.

E. A prescription generated in this state must be dispensed as written only if the prescriber writes or clearly displays "DAW", "dispense as written", "do not substitute" or "medically necessary" or any statement by the prescriber that clearly indicates an intent to prevent substitution on the face of the prescription form. A prescription from out of state or from agencies of the United States government must be dispensed as written only if the prescriber writes or clearly displays "do not substitute", "dispense as written" or "medically necessary" or any statement by the prescriber that clearly indicates an intent to prevent substitution on the face of the prescription form.

H. The liability of a pharmacist in substituting according to this section is no greater than that incurred in the filling of a generically written prescription.  This subsection does not limit or diminish the responsibility for the strength, purity or quality of drugs provided in section 32-1963.  The failure of a prescriber to specify that no substitution is authorized does not constitute evidence of negligence.

I. A pharmacist may not make a substitution pursuant to this section unless the manufacturer or distributor of the generic equivalent drug or interchangeable biological product has shown that:

1. All products dispensed have an expiration date on the original package.

2. The manufacturer or distributor maintains recall and return capabilities for unsafe or defective drugs or biological products.

J. The board shall maintain on its public website a link to the current list of each biological product determined by the United States food and drug administration to be an interchangeable biological product.

K. The labeling and oral notification requirements of this section do not apply to pharmacies serving patients in a health care institution as defined in section 36-401.  However, in order for this exemption to apply to hospitals, the hospital must have a formulary to which all medical practitioners of that hospital have agreed and that is available for inspection by the board.

L. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Biological product" has the same meaning prescribed in 42 United States Code

2. "Brand name drug" means a drug with a proprietary name assigned to it by the manufacturer or distributor.

3. "Formulary" means a list of medicinal drugs.

4. "Generic equivalent" or "generically equivalent" means a drug that has an identical amount of the same active chemical ingredients in the same dosage form, that meets applicable standards of strength, quality and purity according to the United States pharmacopeia or other nationally recognized compendium and that, if administered in the same amounts, will provide comparable therapeutic effects. Generic equivalent or generically equivalent does not include a drug that is listed by the United States food and drug administration as having unresolved bioequivalence concerns according to the administration's most recent publication of approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations.

5. "Interchangeable biological product" means a biological product that either:

(a) The United States food and drug administration has licensed and determined meets the safety standards for determining interchangeability pursuant to 42 United States Code section 262(k)(4).

(b) Is determined to be therapeutically equivalent as set forth in the latest edition of the supplement to the United States food and drug administration's approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations.

A licensee, owner, including the current owner of the property, operator, agent or developer may request a hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  A summary suspension shall be deemed to be final if a request for a hearing is not received within thirty days as provided by section 41-1092.03.

C. The department may issue a summary suspension when the department receives notice that a person licensed pursuant to this chapter has been convicted of a felony offense and is currently incarcerated for the conviction, paroled or under the supervision of a parole or community supervision officer or is on probation as a result of the conviction.  This subsection does not limit the commissioner's authority to seek revocation of a license or other disciplinary action pursuant to this chapter.

The clerk shall treat the commissioner's order in the same manner as a judgment of the superior court.

D. It is unlawful for a person or group of persons acting in concert to attempt to avoid this article by acting in concert to divide a parcel of land or sell subdivision lots by using a series of owners or conveyances or by any other method that ultimately results in the division of the lands into a subdivision or the sale of subdivided land.  The plan or offering is subject to this article.  Unlawful acting in concert pursuant to this subsection with respect to the sale or lease of subdivision lots requires proof that the real estate licensee or other licensed professional knew or with the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that property which the licensee listed or for which the licensee acted in any capacity as agent was subdivided land subject to this article.  A familial relationship alone is not sufficient to constitute unlawful acting in concert.

E. A creation of six or more lots, parcels or fractional interests in improved or unimproved land, lots or parcels of any size is subject to this article except when:

1. Each of the lots, parcels or fractional interests represents, on a partition basis, thirty-six acres or more in area of land located in this state, including to the centerline of dedicated roads or easements, if any, contiguous to the land in which the interests are held.

2. The lots, parcels or fractional interests are the result of a foreclosure sale, the exercise by a trustee under a deed of trust of a power of sale or the grant of a deed in lieu of foreclosure.  This paragraph does not allow circumvention of the requirements of this article.

3. The lots, parcels or fractional interests are created by a valid order or decree of a court pursuant to and through compliance with title 12, chapter 8, article 7 or by operation of law. This paragraph does not allow circumvention of the requirements of this article.

4. The lots, parcels or fractional interests consist of interests in any oil, gas or mineral lease, permit, claim or right therein and such interests are regulated as securities by the United States or by this state.

5. The lots, parcels or fractional interests are registered as securities under the laws of the United States or the laws of this state or are exempt transactions under section 44-1844, 44-1845 or 44-1846.

6. The commissioner by special order exempts offerings or dispositions of any lots, parcels or fractional interests from compliance with this article on written petition and on a showing satisfactory to the commissioner that compliance is not essential to the public interest or for the protection of buyers.

7. A sale or lease of a lot, parcel or fractional interest occurs ten or more years after the sale or lease of another lot, parcel or fractional interest and the other lot, parcel or fractional interest is not subject to this article and is treated as an independent parcel unless, upon investigation by the commissioner, there is evidence of intent to subdivide.

(i) The director of water resources' report or the developer's brief summary of the report as approved by the commissioner on the proposed water supply for the subdivision.

(ii) A statement describing the exemption under which the subdivision was approved, including the specific conditions of the exemption that were met.  If the plat was approved by the legislative body of a city or town pursuant to an exemption authorized by section 9-463.01, subsection K or by the board of supervisors of a county pursuant to an exemption authorized by section 11-823, subsection B, paragraph 1, the subdivider shall record the document required by section 33-406.

(d) The subdivision received final plat approval from the city, town or county before the requirement for an adequate water supply became effective in the city, town or county, and there have been no material changes to the plat since the final plat approval.  If changes were made to the plat after the final plat approval, the director of water resources shall determine whether the changes are material pursuant to the rules adopted by the director to implement section 45-108.  If this subdivision applies, the state real estate commissioner shall require that all promotional materials and contracts for the sale of lots in the subdivision adequately display the director of water resources' report or the developer's brief summary of the report as approved by the commissioner on the proposed water supply for the subdivision.

H. The commissioner may authorize the subdivider to file as the notice of intention to subdivide lands, in lieu of some or all of the requirements of subsection A of this section, a copy of the statement of record filed with respect to the subdivision pursuant to the federal interstate land sales full disclosure act if the statement complies with the requirements of the act and the regulations pertinent to the act.

I. Neither a real estate sales contract, conveyance, lease, assignment or other instrument to transfer any interest in subdivided land nor any covenant or restriction affecting real property shall contain any provision limiting the right of any party to appear or testify in support of or opposition to zoning changes, building permits or any other official acts affecting real property before a governmental body or official considering zoning changes, building permits or any other official acts affecting real property, whether the property is located within or outside of the boundaries of the subdivision. All contractual provisions that conflict with this subsection are declared to be contrary to public policy. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prohibit private restrictions on the use of any real property.

J. Before offering subdivided lands for lease or sale, the subdivider who makes any promises through any form of advertising media that the subdivided lands will be exclusively a retirement community or one that is limited to the residency of adults or senior citizens shall include the promises in the deed restrictions affecting any interest in real property within the subdivided lands.

5. A subdivider may commence sales or leasing activities as permitted under this article after obtaining a certificate of administrative completeness from the commissioner.

6. Before or after the commissioner issues a certificate of administrative completeness or, if applicable, after the notification and public report are deemed to be administratively complete pursuant to paragraph 4 of this subsection, the department may examine any public report, subdivision or applicant that has applied for or received the certificate.  If the commissioner determines that the subdivider or subdivision is not in compliance with any requirement of state law or that grounds exist under this chapter to suspend, deny or revoke a public report, the commissioner may commence an administrative action under section 32-2154 or 32-2157.

G. If the subdivision is within an active management area, as defined in section 45-402, the commissioner shall deny issuance of a public report or the use of any exemption pursuant to section 32-2181.02, subsection B unless the subdivider has been issued a certificate of assured water supply by the director of water resources and has paid all applicable fees pursuant to sections 48-3772 and 48-3774.01, or unless the subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an assured water supply by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-576 or is exempt from the requirement pursuant to section 45-576.

I. A subdivider shall not sell or lease or offer for sale or lease in this state any lots, parcels or fractional interests in a subdivision without first obtaining a public report from the commissioner except as provided in section 32-2181.01 or 32-2181.02, and a certificate of administrative completeness issued pursuant to this section. Unless exempt, the sale or lease of subdivided lands prior to issuance of the public report or failure to deliver the public report to the purchaser or lessee shall render the sale or lease rescindable by the purchaser or lessee.  An action by the purchaser or lessee to rescind the transaction shall be brought within three years of the date of execution of the purchase or lease agreement by the purchaser or lessee. In any rescission action, the prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.

P. If the court appoints a receiver without notice, the court shall further direct that a copy of the order appointing a receiver be served on the person engaged in or engaging in a practice declared to be unlawful under this article by delivering the order to the last address of the person that is on file with the state real estate department.

If there has been a material change to the plan under which a subdivision is offered for sale or lease and an amendment to the public report is required, a purchaser or lessee who has executed a real estate sales contract or lease before the occurrence of the material change but has not yet completed performance under the real estate sales contract or has not taken possession under the lease may cancel the real estate sales contract or lease within ten days after receiving written notice from the subdivider of the material change if the material change adversely impacts the purchaser or lessee and was caused by the subdivider or an entity controlled by the subdivider or if the subdivider had actual knowledge of the material change at the time the real estate sales contract or lease was executed by the purchaser or lessee. Notwithstanding that the subdivider was not aware of the material change and did not cause the change to come about, the purchaser or lessee may cancel the sales contract or lease as provided by this subsection if the material change would involve an occupant's health, safety or ability to make designated use of the lot. This subsection does not create any cause of action, for rescission or otherwise, in favor of a purchaser who has not been impacted adversely by the material change.

C. A filing fee of one-half of the amount that was charged for the initial public report pursuant to section 32-2182, but no less than two hundred fifty dollars, shall accompany an application for an amended public report.

The claimant must file the original application, including appendices, within two years after the termination of all proceedings, reviews and appeals connected with the judgment.  The commissioner, in the commissioner's sole discretion, may waive the two-year application deadline if the commissioner determines that the waiver best serves the public interest. Delivery of the application must be by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested.

6. For the purpose of an application that is not based on a criminal restitution order, a statement by the claimant, signed under penalty of perjury, that the complaint on which the underlying judgment is based was prosecuted conscientiously and in good faith. For the purposes of this paragraph, "conscientiously and in good faith" means that all of the following apply:

(a) No party that was potentially liable to the claimant in the underlying transaction was intentionally and without good cause omitted from the complaint.

(b) No party named in the complaint who otherwise reasonably appeared capable of responding in damages was intentionally and without good cause dismissed from the complaint.

(c) The claimant employed no other procedural means contrary to the diligent prosecution of the complaint in order to seek to qualify for the recovery fund.

7. For the purpose of an application that is based on a criminal restitution order, all of the following statements by the claimant, signed under penalty of perjury:

(b) The claimant has not intentionally and without good cause failed to pursue in a civil action for damages all persons potentially liable to the claimant in the underlying transaction who otherwise reasonably appeared capable of responding in damages other than a defendant who is the subject of a criminal restitution order.

(c) The claimant employed no other procedural means contrary to the diligent prosecution of the complaint in order to seek to qualify for the recovery fund.

8. The following statements, signed under penalty of perjury, and information from the claimant:

(a) The claimant is not a spouse of the judgment debtor or a personal representative of the spouse.

(b) The claimant has complied with all of the requirements of this article.

(c) The judgment underlying the claim meets the requirements of this article.

(d) The claimant has recorded a certified copy of the superior court judgment or transcript of judgment pursuant to sections 33-961 and 33-962 in the county where the judgment was obtained and in the counties where all judgment debtors reside and has provided a copy of the recorded judgment to the commissioner.

(e) The claimant has caused the judgment debtor to make discovery under oath, pursuant to section 12-1631, concerning the debtor's property.

(f) The claimant has caused a writ of execution to be issued on the judgment and the officer executing the writ has made a return showing either:

(i) That no personal or real property of the judgment debtor liable to be levied on in satisfaction of the judgment could be found, sold or applied.

(ii) That the amount realized on the sale of the property, or as much of the property that was found, under the execution was insufficient to satisfy the judgment.

(g) The claimant has caused a writ of garnishment to be issued to each known employer of the judgment debtor ascertained by the claimant, that each garnishee-defendant has complied with the respective writ and any judgment or order resulting from the writ and that the amount realized from all judgments against the garnishee-defendants was insufficient to satisfy the balance due on the judgment.

(h) The claimant has deducted the following amounts from the actual or compensatory damages awarded by the court:

(i) Any amount recovered or anticipated from the judgment debtor or debtors.

(ii) Any amount recovered through collection efforts undertaken pursuant to subdivisions (d) through (g) of this paragraph and including an itemized valuation of the assets discovered and amounts applied.

(iv) Any amount recovered or anticipated from in-court or out-of-court settlements.

(v) Any amount of tax benefits accrued or taken as deductions on federal, state or local income tax returns.

F. If the claim is based on a judgment against a salesperson or broker and the claimant has not obtained a judgment against the salesperson's or broker's employing broker, if any, or has not diligently pursued the assets of the employing broker, the department shall deny the claim for failure to diligently pursue the assets of all other persons liable to the claimant in the transaction unless the claimant demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that either:

1. The salesperson or broker was not employed by a broker at the time of the transaction.

2. The salesperson's or broker's employing broker would not have been liable to the claimant because the salesperson or broker acted outside the scope of employment in the transaction.

G. The commissioner, at the commissioner's sole discretion, may waive compliance with one or more of the requirements enumerated in subsection E, paragraph 8 or subsection F of this section if the claim is based on an award pursuant to a criminal restitution order or if the commissioner is satisfied that the claimant has taken all reasonable steps to collect the amount of the judgment or the unsatisfied part of the judgment from all judgment debtors but has been unable to collect.

H. If the commissioner finds it is likely that the total remaining liability of the recovery fund is insufficient to pay in full the valid claims of all aggrieved persons who may have claims against any one licensee, the commissioner may petition the court to initiate a proration proceeding. The court shall grant the petition and order a hearing to distribute the total remaining liability of the fund among the applicants in the ratio that their respective claims bear to the aggregate of the valid claims or in such other manner as the court deems equitable.  The commissioner or any party may file a proposed plan for equitable distribution of the available monies. The distribution of monies shall be among the persons entitled to share them, without regard to the order of priority in which their respective judgments may have been obtained or their respective applications may have been filed. The court may require all applicants and prospective applicants against one licensee to be joined in one action, to the end that the respective rights of all the applicants to the recovery fund may be equitably adjudicated and settled.  The court shall not include in the claims for proration the claim of any person who has not, within ninety days after the court has entered the order for proration, filed a complaint with the court, served the licensee and provided written notice of the claim to the commissioner.  The liability of the fund on any application affected by a proration proceeding is based on the limits in effect on the date when the last application for payment is filed.  The court may refuse to consider or award prorated recovery to any person who fails to expeditiously prosecute a claim against the licensee or promptly file an application for payment and submit supporting documentation as required by this article.

I. If the commissioner pays from the real estate recovery fund any amount in settlement of an applicant's claim or toward satisfaction of a judgment against a licensed broker, designated broker for a corporation or salesperson, the license of the broker, designated broker for a corporation or salesperson shall be automatically terminated upon the issuance of an order authorizing payment from the real estate recovery fund. A broker, designated broker for a corporation or salesperson is not eligible to receive a new license until the licensee has repaid in full, plus interest at the rate provided by section 44-1201, the amount paid from the real estate recovery fund on the licensee's account and has provided evidence to the commissioner that the judgment has been fully satisfied.

J. If, at any time, the money deposited in the real estate recovery fund is insufficient to satisfy any duly authorized claim or portion of a claim, the commissioner shall, when sufficient money has been deposited in the real estate recovery fund, satisfy the unpaid claims or portions of claims, in the order that the claims or portions of claims were originally filed, plus accumulated interest at the rate of four per cent a year.

K. For the purposes of this section, "complaint" means the facts of the transaction on which the judgment is based.

No corporation hereafter organized for the operation of a perpetual or endowed-care cemetery nor any owner of a cemetery not previously operating as a perpetual or endowed-care cemetery shall advertise or sell plots in such cemetery under the representation that the cemetery or any individual plot therein is entitled to perpetual or endowed care until there has been established an irrevocable trust fund to provide for such care in accordance with the following schedule:

1. Cemeteries located in an area having a population of less than ten thousand persons within a radius of fifteen miles from the center of such cemetery must deposit with the trustee the sum of ten thousand dollars in cash.

2. Cemeteries located in an area having a population of ten thousand or more persons but less than fifteen thousand persons within a radius of fifteen miles from the center of such cemetery must deposit with the trustee the sum of fifteen thousand dollars in cash.

3. Cemeteries located in an area having a population of fifteen thousand or more persons but less than twenty-five thousand persons within a radius of fifteen miles from the center of such cemetery must deposit with the trustee the sum of twenty thousand dollars in cash.

#### Section 32-2194.27. Restrictive use of income from endowed-care fund; obligation

The irrevocable trust fund established pursuant to section 32-2194.26 shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing and shall contain the following provisions:

1. There shall be designated a trustee for the endowed-care fund that is a financial institution authorized to do business in this state and authorized to act as trustee by the laws of this state for such investments. The trustee must be one in which no officer, director or owner of the cemetery is financially interested in any way.

2. The principal of the trust fund shall remain permanently intact, and only the income or the unitrust amount specified in section 14-11014 or 14-11015 shall be expended. It is the intent of this section that the income or unitrust amount of the fund shall be used solely for the care of plots or other burial spaces sold to third persons with a provision for perpetual or endowed care and the care of such other portions of the cemetery immediately surrounding such plots as may be necessary to preserve the beauty and dignity of the plots sold. The fund or its income shall never be used for the development, improvement or embellishment of unsold portions of the cemetery so as to relieve the owner of the cemetery of the ordinary cost incurred in preparing such property for sale.

3. A financial institution acting as a trustee does not have a legal obligation to operate a cemetery other than providing trust fund income to the receiver or successor of a cemetery unable to meet its perpetual care obligations.  A trustee, in its sole discretion and without the approval of the court, may convert the trust to a total return unitrust and administer the endowed-care fund as provided in section 14-11014.

 

#### Section 32-2194.28. Deposit in endowed-care fund from sales

A. In addition to establishing a trust fund as required by this article, every perpetual or endowed-care cemetery shall deposit into its trust fund according to the following schedule for each sale within thirty days after the contract for the purchase of cemetery property is paid in full:

1. Two dollars seventy-five cents per square foot for each grave.

2. Thirty-six dollars for each niche.

3. One hundred twenty dollars for each crypt.

B. In addition to the deposits required in subsection A of this section, a cemetery may deposit in its trust fund up to fifteen per cent of the gross sales price of a grave, niche or crypt.

C. This section applies to every cemetery which in any way represents that it is a perpetual or endowed-care cemetery, regardless of whether it operated as a perpetual or endowed-care cemetery before July 2, 1963.

D. In the case of a perpetual or endowed-care cemetery which was in operation as a perpetual or endowed-care cemetery before July 2, 1963, the fund created by the deposits which subsection A of this section requires is subject to the same restrictions to which the trust funds required by sections 32-2194.24 and 32-2194.25 are subject.

 

#### Section 32-2194.29. Posting of signs by cemeteries

Each cemetery shall post in a conspicuous place in the office or offices where sales are conducted and in a conspicuous place at or near the entrance of the cemetery or its administration building, and readily accessible to the public, a legible sign in lettering of a size and style to be approved by the real estate commissioner indicating either the cemetery is an endowed or a nonendowed cemetery.

#### Section 32-2194.30. Restriction on use of endowed-care funds

Endowed-care funds shall not be used for any purpose other than to provide for the care of burial spaces as prescribed in section 32-2194.27. In investing these funds, the trustee shall exercise the judgment and care of a prudent investor under the circumstances then prevailing, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income or unitrust amount as well as the probable safety of their capital. Within the limitations of the foregoing standard, and subject to any express provisions or limitations contained in any particular trust instrument, a trustee is authorized to acquire every kind of property, real, personal or mixed, and every kind of investment, specifically including corporate obligations of every kind and stocks, preferred or common, that prudent investors acquire for their own account.

 

#### Section 32-2194.31. Crematories

Crematories which are licensed as part of a cemetery under this chapter shall comply with the requirements of chapter 12, article 6 of this title and rules adopted pursuant to that article.

#### Section 32-2194.32. Opening and closing of burial places

If any grave, mausoleum, niche or other place used or intended to be used for the burial of human remains is located in a cemetery, only a person employed or designated by the cemetery may open or close the grave, mausoleum, niche or other place used or intended to be used for the burial of human remains, subject to the rules established by the cemetery.

#### Section 32-2194.33. Cemetery property owners; address notification reclamation; abandoned cemetery plot

A. For the purposes of this section, an owner of cemetery property in any cemetery licensed under this chapter shall keep the cemetery informed in writing of the owner's current residence address.  Before initiating a notice of abandonment, the cemetery shall notify each cemetery property owner by letter at the owner's last known address and notify all future cemetery property owners, in the contract for sale and the certificate of ownership, of the requirement to keep the cemetery informed in writing of their current residence address.

B. There is a presumption that cemetery property in any cemetery licensed under this chapter has been abandoned when an owner of unused cemetery property has failed to provide the cemetery with a current residence address for a period of fifty consecutive years and as a result the cemetery is unable to communicate by certified mail with the owner of the unused cemetery property.  There is not a presumption of abandonment if either of the following occurs:

1. Cemetery property held in common ownership is adjoining whether in a grave space, plot, mausoleum, columbarium or other place of interment and is used within common ownership.

1. Describe the cemetery plot certified to have been abandoned.

2. Set forth the name of the last known owner of the cemetery plot or, if the owner is known to the cemetery to be deceased, the names, if known to the cemetery, of claimants that are heirs at law, next of kin or specific devisees under the will of the owner.

3. Describe the failure of the owner or claimants as prescribed by paragraph 2 of this subsection to keep the cemetery informed of the owner's current residence address for a period of fifty consecutive years or more.

4. Certify that cemetery property has not been included that is held in common ownership with any abandoned cemetery property as prescribed by subsection B of this section and that a memorial marker has not been placed on or attached to the cemetery property.

D. Irrespective of diversity of ownership of the cemetery property, a cemetery may include in its certification cemetery properties of various types.

E. The cemetery shall publish a notice of the approved abandoned cemetery property once each week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the cemetery property is located.

F. After one hundred twenty days from the final publication of the notice as provided in subsection E of this section, if there has been no notification of the address of the current owner, the cemetery shall have the right to resell the cemetery property and transfer the ownership of the cemetery property as provided in the cemetery's certificate of authority.

G. On the sale of each lot, grave, niche or crypt reclaimed pursuant to this section, the cemetery shall contribute to the endowed-care trust fund the amount currently required by section 32-2194.28.

H. On showing of evidence of right of ownership, persons or their heirs who were owners of cemetery property that was sold under this section shall have the right at any time to obtain equivalent cemetery property in the cemetery without additional charge.  If no cemetery property is desired, the persons or their heirs may obtain and recover the amount originally paid to the cemetery for the cemetery property.

I. The cemetery shall make available cemetery property equal to ten per cent of the abandoned cemetery property sold under this section for the use of persons or their heirs who were owners of cemetery property that was sold under this section and who have the right at any time to obtain cemetery property in the cemetery under this section.

J. Persons who purchase cemetery property reclaimed pursuant to this section shall have the right to sell, alienate or otherwise transfer the cemetery property subject to and in accordance with the rules of the cemetery and payment of any applicable transfer fee.

D. If the timeshare property is within an active management area, as defined in section 45-402, the commissioner shall deny issuance of a public report unless the developer has been issued a certificate of assured water supply by the director of water resources and has paid all applicable fees pursuant to sections 48-3772 and 48-3774.01, or unless the developer has obtained a written commitment of water service for the timeshare property from a city, town or private water company designated as having an assured water supply by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-576.

Unless exempt, any sale or lease of timeshare interests in a timeshare plan that consists of twelve or more timeshare interests before issuance of the public report or authorization to conduct pre-sales or failure to deliver the public report or evidence of pre-sale authorization renders the sale or lease rescindable by the purchaser or lessee. An action by the purchaser or lessee to rescind the transaction must be brought within three years of the date of the execution of the purchase or lease agreement by the purchaser. In any rescission action, the prevailing party is entitled to reasonable attorney fees as determined by the court.

The prospective buyer and prospective seller shall have ten business days after the prospective buyer's receipt of the public report and the proposed purchase agreement to enter into a contract for the purchase of the timeshare interest.

After the refund, neither the prospective buyer nor the prospective seller has any obligation arising out of the timeshare interest reservation.

7. A prospective buyer may not transfer rights under a reservation without the prior written consent of the prospective seller, and any purported transfer without the consent of the prospective seller is voidable at the sole discretion of the prospective seller.

#### Section 32-2197.12. Blanket encumbrance; lien; alternative assurance

Excluding any encumbrance placed against the purchaser’s timeshare interest securing the purchaser’s payment of purchase money financing for the purchase, the developer is not entitled to the release of any monies placed in escrow under section 32-2197.05 with respect to each timeshare interest and any other property or rights to property appurtenant to the timeshare interest, including any amenities represented to the purchaser as being part of the timeshare plan, until the developer has provided satisfactory evidence to the commissioner of one of the following:

1. The timeshare interest together with any other property or rights to property appurtenant to the timeshare interest, including any amenities represented to the purchaser as being part of the timeshare plan, are free and clear of any of the claims of the developer, any owner of the underlying fee, a mortgagee, judgment creditor or other lienor or any other person having a blanket encumbrance against the timeshare interest or appurtenant property or property rights.

C. After such hearing, the commissioner may issue such order or orders as the commissioner deems necessary to protect the public interest and ensure compliance with the law, or rules or public report, or may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction against the person to enjoin the person from continuing such violation or engaging in such violation or doing any act or acts in furtherance of such violation. The court may make such orders or judgments, including the appointment of a receiver, as are necessary to prevent the use or employment by a person of any unlawful practices or which are necessary to restore to any person in interest any monies or property, real or personal, which has been acquired by means of any practice declared to be unlawful in this article.

B. The court, upon receipt of an application for the appointment of a receiver or for a writ of ne exeat, or both, shall examine the verified application of the commissioner and such other evidence that the commissioner presents to the court.

Except for applicants who are veterinary faculty members who have graduated from a veterinary college, applicants for all temporary permits must be graduates of an American veterinary medical association accredited veterinary college or holders of a certificate from the educational commission for foreign veterinary graduates or from a program for the assessment of veterinary education at the time of application.

B. The temporary permit issued under this section entitles a veterinary license applicant to engage in the active practice of veterinary medicine in this state as an employee of a licensed veterinarian, this state or any county or municipality in this state. The applicant is eligible for the next examination, if the applicant has not violated any provision of this chapter. An applicant working under the direct and personal instruction, control or supervision of a licensed veterinarian and whose compensation is paid by the veterinarian may perform those acts of animal health care assigned by the veterinarian having responsibility for the care of the animal.  The temporary permit described in this subsection expires twenty days after the examination. If the applicant fails for good and sufficient reason to take the examination, the board, by majority consent, may extend the permit until the next succeeding examination. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the holder of a temporary permit must be examined and satisfactorily pass the license examination next following the issuance of the permit and duly receive a license in order to continue active professional practice.  The temporary permit may be extended only one time. For the purposes of this subsection, "direct and personal instruction, control or supervision" means that a veterinarian who is licensed by the board is physically present and personally supervising a temporary permittee when the permittee is practicing acts of veterinary medicine except if the permittee is at a temporary site for the purpose of delivering services to large animals or if the permittee is administering emergency services not during regular office hours. In these cases, phone contact constitutes direct and personal instruction, control or supervision.

C. If an employer, for any reason, terminates the employment of the applicant, the employing veterinarian shall notify the board and the temporary permit described in subsection B of this section is immediately void.

D. An emergency temporary permit that is issued to an individual who is a veterinarian licensed in good standing in another state entitles the individual to provide voluntary veterinary care during a state of emergency or local emergency for the sole purpose of assisting in care related to that emergency. The emergency temporary permit expires ninety days after the date of issuance or at the end of the state of emergency or local emergency, whichever occurs first. An applicant for an emergency temporary permit shall submit a complete application, including information regarding veterinary licensure in any other state and verification that the statutes and rules pertaining to the board have been reviewed.  The board shall verify whether the veterinarian is licensed in the state or states indicated and confirm the applicant's good standing. The applicant is not required to pass the state veterinary examination. A veterinarian who is issued an emergency temporary permit under this section shall practice in accordance with all laws and rules related to the practice of veterinary medicine in this state. The board may investigate any alleged violation by a holder of an emergency temporary permit and take disciplinary action as prescribed in this chapter. A veterinarian granted an emergency temporary permit under this section is a licensed, certified or authorized emergency responder pursuant to section 49-133 and an emergency worker as defined in section 26-301.

E. For the purposes of this section, "emergency temporary permit" means a temporary permit that is issued to a veterinarian who is licensed in another state and who enters this state to provide voluntary services during a state of emergency as declared by the governor or a local emergency declared by a county board of supervisors pursuant to section 26-311.

Failure to pay the license fee before February 1 following expiration of the license shall be a forfeiture of the license, and the license shall not be restored except upon written application to the board and payment of a penalty fee of fifty dollars in addition to all regular license fees and past due fees owed to the board. A person applying for reinstatement of a license within thirty-six months of expiration shall not be required to submit to an examination because of failure to pay the license fee, but it is unlawful for a person to practice veterinary medicine or any branch of veterinary medicine during the period in which the person's license has been forfeited by reason of nonpayment of the license fee. If an applicant for reinstatement of a license has not completed the continuing education requirements, a license may be reinstated if the continuing education requirements are completed within six months of reinstatement.

C. If the board finds, based on the information it receives under subsections A and B of this section, that the public safety imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, the board may restrict a license or order a summary suspension of a license pending proceedings for revocation or other action.  If the board acts pursuant to this subsection, the physician assistant shall also be served with a written notice of complaint and formal hearing, setting forth the charges, and is entitled to a formal hearing before the board or an administrative law judge on the charges within sixty days pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

D. If, after completing its investigation, the board finds that the information provided pursuant to subsection A of this section is not of sufficient seriousness to merit disciplinary action against the physician assistant's license, it may take the following actions:

2. File an advisory letter.  The licensee may file a written response with the board within thirty days after receiving the advisory letter.

(b) Temporary suspension for not to exceed twelve months.

(c) Restitution of patient fees.

A. The board on its own motion may investigate any evidence that appears to show that a licensee is or may be medically incompetent, guilty of unprofessional conduct or mentally or physically unable to engage safely in the practice of homeopathic medicine. Any licensee, the Arizona homeopathic and integrative medical association or any health care institution as defined in section 36-401 shall, and any other person may, report to the board any information the person may have that appears to show that a licensee is or may be medically incompetent, guilty of unprofessional conduct or mentally or physically unable to engage safely in the practice of homeopathic medicine. The board shall notify the licensee about whom information is received as to the content of the information within one hundred twenty days after receipt of the information. Any person who reports or provides information to the board in good faith is not subject to an action for civil damages as a result of reporting or providing the information. The board may not open an investigation if identifying information regarding the complainant is not provided to the board.  It is an act of unprofessional conduct for any licensee to fail to report as required by this section. Any health care institution that fails to report as required by this section shall be reported by the board to the institution's licensing agency.

B. If a complainant wishes to have the complainant's identifying information withheld from the licensee against whom the allegation of unprofessional conduct is being made, the board shall enter into a written agreement with the complainant stating that the complainant's identifying information will not be provided to the licensee against whom the allegation of unprofessional conduct is being made to the extent consistent with the administrative appeals process. The board shall post this policy on the board's website where a person would submit a complaint online.

C. A health care institution shall inform the board if the privileges of a licensee to practice in the health care institution are denied, revoked, suspended or limited because of actions by the licensee that jeopardized patient health and welfare or if the licensee resigns during pending proceedings for revocation, suspension or limitation of privileges.  A report to the board pursuant to this subsection shall contain a general statement of the reasons the health care institution denied or took action to revoke, suspend or limit a licensee's privileges.

D. The board may conduct investigations necessary to fully inform itself with respect to any evidence filed with the board under subsection A of this section.  As part of this investigation, the board may require the licensee under investigation to be interviewed by board representatives or, at the licensee's expense, to undergo any combination of mental, physical, oral or written medical competency examinations.

E. If the information gathered under subsections A and C of this section indicates that the protection of public health requires that the board take emergency action, it may order the summary suspension of a license pending the outcome of a formal disciplinary hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  The board shall serve the suspended licensee with a written notice of the specific charges and the time and place of the formal hearing. The board shall hold this hearing within sixty days after the suspension unless the board for good reason shown by the licensee grants an extension on the hearing date.

F. If, after completing its investigation, the board finds that the information provided pursuant to subsection A of this section is not of sufficient seriousness to merit direct action against the license, it may take any of the following actions:

1. Dismiss if, in the opinion of the board, the information is without merit.

2. File a letter of concern.

3. Issue a nondisciplinary order requiring the licensee to complete a prescribed number of hours of continuing education in an area or areas prescribed by the board to provide the licensee with the necessary understanding of current developments, skills, procedures or treatment.

G. If after completing its initial investigation under subsection A of this section the board determines that rehabilitative or disciplinary action can be taken without the presence of the licensee at an informal interview, the board and the licensee may enter into a stipulated agreement to limit or restrict the licensee's practice or to rehabilitate the licensee, protect the public and ensure the licensee's ability to safely engage in the practice of homeopathic medicine.

H. If after completing its investigation the board believes that this information is or may be true, the board may request an informal interview with the licensee. If the licensee refuses the invitation or accepts the invitation and the results of the interview indicate that suspension or revocation of the license may be in order, the board shall issue a formal complaint and conduct a formal hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10. If after completing the informal interview the board finds that the information provided under subsection A of this section is not of sufficient seriousness to merit suspension or revocation of the license, it may take the following actions:

1. Dismiss if, in the opinion of the board, the information is without merit.

2. File a letter of concern.

3. Issue a decree of censure.  A decree of censure constitutes an official action against the license and may include a requirement for restitution of fees to a patient resulting from violations of this chapter or board rules.

4. Fix a period and terms of probation best adapted to protect the public health and safety and rehabilitate or educate the licensee. The probation, if deemed necessary, may include temporary suspension of the license for not to exceed twelve months, restriction of the license to practice homeopathic medicine or a requirement for restitution of fees to a patient resulting from violations of this chapter or board rules.  If a licensee fails to comply with the terms of probation, the board may file a summons, complaint and notice of hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10 based on the information considered by the board at the informal interview and any other acts or conduct alleged to be in violation of this chapter or board rules.

5. Enter into an agreement with the licensee to restrict or limit the licensee's practice or medical activities in order to rehabilitate the licensee, protect the public and ensure the licensee's ability to safely engage in the practice of homeopathic medicine.

Actions to enforce the collection of these penalties shall be brought in the name of this state by the attorney general or the county attorney in the justice court or the superior court in the county in which the violation occurred.  Penalties imposed under this section are in addition to and not in limitation of other penalties imposed pursuant to this chapter.

J. If in the opinion of the board it appears that the allegations concerning a licensee are of a magnitude as to warrant suspension or revocation of the license, the board shall serve on the licensee a summons and a complaint fully setting forth the conduct or inability concerned and setting a date, time and place for a hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10 to be held before the board in not less than sixty days from the date of the notice.

K. A licensee who wishes to be present at the hearing in person or by representation, or both, shall file a verified answer with the board within twenty days after receiving service of the summons and complaint. The licensee may present witnesses at this hearing. A licensee who has been notified of a complaint pursuant to this section shall file with the board a written response not more than twenty days after service of the complaint and the notice of hearing.  If the licensee fails to file an answer in writing, it is deemed an admission of the act or acts charged in the complaint and notice of hearing and the board may take disciplinary action pursuant to this chapter without a hearing.

L. The board shall issue subpoenas for witnesses as it may need and for witnesses as the licensee may request.  Any person refusing to obey a subpoena shall be certified by the board to the superior court in the county in which service was made, and the court may institute proceedings for contempt of court.

M. Service of the summons and complaint shall be as required in civil cases.

N. Service of subpoenas for witnesses shall be as provided by law for the service of subpoenas generally.

O. A licensee who after a hearing is found to be guilty of unprofessional conduct or is found to be mentally or physically unable to engage safely in the practice of homeopathic medicine is subject to any combination of censure, probation or suspension of license or revocation of the license for a prescribed period of time or permanently and under conditions that the board deems appropriate for the protection of the public health and safety and just in the circumstances.

Within five days after the service of a subpoena on any person requiring the production of any evidence in that person's possession or under that person's control, the person may petition the board to revoke, limit or modify the subpoena. The board shall revoke, limit or modify the subpoena if in its opinion the evidence required does not relate to unlawful practices covered by this chapter, is not relevant to the charge that is the subject matter of the hearing or investigation or does not describe with sufficient particularity the physical evidence whose production is required.

3. Apply to any remedial or technical amendments to any legislation.

#### Section 32-3103. Regulation of health professions; legislation; criteria

A. Regulation shall not be imposed on any unregulated health profession for the purpose of prohibiting competition, but only for the exclusive purpose of protecting the public interest. All proposed legislation to regulate a health profession for the first time shall be reviewed according to the following criteria. A health profession shall be regulated by this state only if:

1. There is credible evidence that the unregulated practice of that health profession can clearly harm or endanger the public health, safety or welfare and the potential for harm is easily recognizable and not remote or dependent on tenuous argument.

2. The public needs and can reasonably be expected to benefit from an assurance of initial and continuing professional ability.

3. The public cannot be effectively protected by other means in a more cost-beneficial manner.

B. After evaluating the criteria prescribed in subsection A of this section and considering governmental and societal costs and benefits, if the legislature finds that it is necessary to regulate a health profession not previously regulated by law, the legislature shall implement the least restrictive alternative method of regulation to address the specific harm or danger identified, consistent with the public interest and the following:

1. If existing common law and statutory civil actions and criminal prohibitions are not sufficient to eradicate existing harm, the regulation shall provide for stricter civil actions and criminal prohibitions.

2. If a service is being performed for individuals that involves a hazard to the public health, safety or welfare, the regulation shall impose inspection requirements and enable an appropriate state agency to enforce violations by injunctive relief in court.

3. If the threat to the public health, safety or economic well-being is relatively small as a result of the operation of the health profession, the regulation shall implement a system of registration.

4. If the consumer may have a substantial basis for relying on the services of a practitioner, the regulation shall implement a system of certification.

5. If it is apparent that adequate regulation cannot be achieved by means other than licensing, the regulation shall implement a system of licensing.

#### Section 32-3104. Health professional groups; written report; legislative informational hearings; proposed legislation

A. A health professional group shall submit a written report explaining the factors prescribed in section 32-3105 or 32-3106 to the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives. The report shall be submitted on or before November 1 before the start of the legislative session for which the legislation is proposed, and the health professional group may request informational hearings pursuant to this section. The president of the senate or the speaker of the house of representatives shall assign the written report to the health committee of the house of representatives and the health and human services committee of the senate, or their respective successor committees, and the legislative committees may conduct informational hearings on the written report before the legislative session convenes. The report may be amended after it has been filed but before any hearing on the report.  The committees shall study the written report and may take public comment on the report at the informational hearings but shall not vote whether to accept or reject the report filed by the health professional group. If a health professional group proposes to increase the scope of practice of its profession, the health professional group may send copies of the written report to the regulatory board of the health profession and the department of health services for review and comment.  A health professional group may seek to introduce legislation in the legislative session regardless of comments, if any, from the informational hearings.

B. If a health professional group's report is not heard by a legislative committee pursuant to subsection A of this section, the health professional group may seek to have legislation introduced in the legislative session for certification, registration or licensure or to increase the scope of practice of an existing regulated health profession. The lack of a hearing shall not be considered as either support or rejection of the health professional group's proposed legislation.

C. Unless there is a material change in the proposed increased scope of practice, a health professional group is not required to refile a report if the health professional group filed the report within the previous five years.  On or before November 1, the health professional group shall notify in writing the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate and the chairpersons of the respective health committees if the health professional group intends to pursue the proposed increased scope of practice during the next legislative session and shall reference the specific report that was previously filed on which the health professional group is relying.

(d) Assurance of the public that practitioners have maintained their competence, including:

(i) Whether the registration, certification or licensure will carry an expiration date.

(ii) Whether renewal will be based only on payment of a fee or whether renewal will involve reexamination, peer review or other enforcement.

Important notice about direct payment

for your health care services

The Arizona Constitution permits you to pay a health care provider directly for health care services.  Before you make any agreement to do so, please read the following important information:

If you are an enrollee of a health care system (more commonly referred to as a health insurance plan) and your health care provider is contracted with the health insurance plan, the following apply:

1. You may not be required to pay the health care provider directly for the services covered by your plan, except for cost share amounts that you are obligated to pay under your plan, such as copayments, coinsurance and deductible amounts.

2. Your provider's agreement with the health insurance plan may prevent the health care provider from billing you for the difference between the provider's billed charges and the amount allowed by your health insurance plan for covered services.

3. If you pay directly for a health care service, your health care provider will not be responsible for submitting claim documentation to your health insurance plan for that claim.  Before paying your claim, your health insurance plan may require you to provide information and submit documentation necessary to determine whether the services are covered under your plan.

4. If you do not pay directly for a health care service, your health care provider may be responsible for submitting claim documentation to your health insurance plan for the health care service.

Your signature below acknowledges that you received this notice before paying directly for a health care service.

I. A health care provider who receives direct payment for a lawful health care service and who complies with subsection H of this section is not responsible for submitting documentation of any kind for purposes of reimbursement to any health care system for that claim if the failure to submit such documentation does not conflict with the terms of any federal or state contracts to which the health care system is a party and the health care provider has agreed to serve patients under or with applicable state or federal programs in which a health care provider and health care system participate.

If an enrollee pays to a health care provider who is an out-of-network provider the direct pay price for a lawful health care service that is covered under the enrollee's health care plan, pursuant to the requirements of this section, the amount paid by the enrollee shall be applied first to the enrollee's in-network deductible with any remaining monies being applied to the enrollee's out-of-network deductible, if applicable.  The amount applied to the in-network deductible shall be the amount paid directly or the insurer's prevailing contracted commercial rate for the enrollee's health care plan in this state for the service or services.  If the service or services do not match standard codes or bundled payment programs in use in this state by the insurer, the amount applied to the in-network deductible shall be the amount paid directly. For the purposes of this subsection, "prevailing contracted commercial rate" means the most usual and customary rate that an insurer offers as payment for a specific service under a specific health care plan, not including a plan offered under medicare or medicaid or on a health insurance exchange.

L. If an enrollee is enrolled in a high deductible plan that qualifies the enrollee for a health savings account as defined in 26 United States Code section 223, the health care system is not liable if the enrollee submits a claim for deductible application of a direct pay amount pursuant to subsection K of this section that jeopardizes the enrollee's status as an individual eligible for favorable tax treatment of the health savings account.

N. This section does not impair the provisions of a health care system's private health care network provider contract, except that a health care provider may accept direct payment from a person or employer or may decline to bill the health care system directly for services paid directly by a person or employer if the health care provider has complied with subsection H of this section and the health care provider's receipt of direct payment and the declination to bill the health care system do not conflict with the terms of any federal or state contract to which the health care system is a party and the health care provider has agreed to serve patients under or with applicable state or federal programs in which both a health care provider and health care system participate.

P. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Direct pay price" means the price that will be charged by a health care provider for a lawful health care service, regardless of the health insurance status of the person, if the entire fee for the service is paid in full directly to a health care provider by the person, including the person's health savings account, or by the person's employer and that does not prohibit a provider from establishing a payment plan with the person paying directly for services.

A. The board, on its own motion or on a complaint, may investigate any evidence that appears to show that a licensee is or may be incompetent, is or may be guilty of unprofessional conduct or is or may be mentally or physically unable to safely engage in the practice of behavioral health. A motion by the board to initiate an investigation shall be made at an open and properly noticed board meeting and shall include the basis on which the investigation is being initiated and the name of the board member making the motion.  The board's vote on the motion to initiate an investigation shall be recorded. As part of its investigation, the board may hold an investigational meeting pursuant to this chapter. Any person may, and a licensee and any entity licensed by the department of health services shall, report to the board any information that would cause a reasonable licensee to believe that another licensee is guilty of unprofessional conduct or is physically or mentally unable to provide behavioral health services competently or safely. Any person or entity that reports or provides information to the board in good faith is not subject to an action for civil damages. It is an act of unprofessional conduct for any licensee to fail to report as required by this section.  The board shall report to the department of health services any entity licensed by the department of health services that fails to report as required by this section. For complaints related to conduct that is inconsistent with professional standards or ethics, scope of practice or standard of care, the board may consult with one or more licensed or retired behavioral health professionals of the same profession as the licensee to review complaints and make recommendations to the board.

B. On determination of reasonable cause, the board shall require, at the licensee's own expense, any combination of mental, physical or psychological examinations, assessments or skills evaluations necessary to determine the licensee's competence or ability to safely engage in the practice of behavioral health and conduct necessary investigations, including investigational interviews between representatives of the board and the licensee, to fully inform the board with respect to any information filed with the board under subsection A of this section.  These examinations may include biological fluid testing. The board may require the licensee, at the licensee's expense, to undergo assessment by a rehabilitative, retraining or assessment program approved by the board.

C. If the board finds, based on the information received pursuant to subsection A or B of this section, that the public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, the board may restrict, limit or order a summary suspension of a license pending proceedings for revocation or other action.  If the board takes action pursuant to this subsection, it must also serve the licensee with a written notice that states the charges and that the licensee is entitled to a formal hearing before the board or an administrative law judge within sixty days.

D. If after completing an investigation the board finds that the information provided is not of sufficient seriousness to merit disciplinary action against the licensee, the board shall either:

1. Dismiss the complaint if, in the opinion of the board, the complaint is without merit.

2. File a letter of concern and dismiss the complaint. The licensee may file a written response with the board within thirty days after the licensee receives the letter of concern.

3. Issue a nondisciplinary order requiring the licensee to complete a prescribed number of hours of continuing education in an area or areas prescribed by the board to provide the licensee with the necessary understanding of current developments, skills, procedures or treatment.

E. A complaint dismissed by the board pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 1 of this section is not a complaint of unprofessional conduct and shall not be disclosed by the board as a complaint on the licensee's complaint history.

F. If after completing its investigation the board believes that the information is or may be true, the board may enter into a consent agreement with the licensee to limit or restrict the licensee's practice or to rehabilitate the licensee, protect the public and ensure the licensee's ability to safely engage in the practice of behavioral health.  A consent agreement may also require the licensee to successfully complete a board approved rehabilitative, retraining or assessment program.

G. If the board finds that the information provided pursuant to subsection A of this section is or may be true, the board may request a formal interview with the licensee. If the licensee refuses the invitation for a formal interview or accepts and the results indicate that grounds may exist for revocation or suspension of the licensee's license for more than twelve months, the board shall issue a formal complaint and order that a hearing be held pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10. If after completing a formal interview the board finds that the protection of the public requires emergency action, the board may order a summary suspension of the licensee's license pending formal revocation proceedings or other action authorized by this section.

H. If after completing the formal interview the board finds the information provided is not of sufficient seriousness to merit suspension for more than twelve months or revocation of the license, the board may take the following actions:

2. File a letter of concern and dismiss the complaint. The licensee may file a written response with the board within thirty days after the licensee receives the letter of concern.

Probation may include temporary suspension not to exceed twelve months, restriction of the licensee's license to practice behavioral health, a requirement for restitution of fees to a client or education or rehabilitation at the licensee's own expense. If a licensee fails to comply with the terms of probation, the board shall serve the licensee with a written notice that states that the licensee is subject to a formal hearing based on the information considered by the board at the formal interview and any other acts or conduct alleged to be in violation of this chapter or rules adopted by the board pursuant to this chapter, including noncompliance with the terms of probation or a consent agreement.

I. If a member state takes adverse action, it shall promptly notify the administrator of the data system. The administrator of the data system shall promptly notify the home state of any adverse actions by remote states.

1. Dismiss the complaint if the board believes that the information is without merit.

2. File a letter of concern if the board believes that while there is insufficient evidence to support direct action against the license of the licensed respiratory care practitioner there is sufficient evidence for the board to notify the licensee that continuing the activities that led to the information being submitted to the board may result in action against the license.

K. A licensee shall respond in writing to the board within thirty days after notice of the hearing is served as prescribed in subsection J of this section.

#### Section 32-4254. Investigative powers; emergency action; disciplinary proceedings; formal interview; hearing; civil penalty

A. The board on its own motion may investigate any evidence that appears to show that a licensee is or may be incompetent or is or may be subject to discipline under this chapter. On written request of a complainant, the board shall review a complaint and take any action it deems appropriate.  The board or the executive director shall notify the licensee as to the content of the complaint as soon as reasonable.  A licensee shall, and any other person may, report to the board any information the person may have that appears to show grounds for disciplinary action against a licensee. Any person or entity that reports or provides information to the board in good faith is not subject to an action for civil damages.  If requested, the board shall not disclose the name of a person who supplies information regarding a licensee's drug or alcohol impairment.  It is an act of unprofessional conduct for any licensee to fail to report as required by this section.

B. If the board finds, based on the information it receives under subsection A of this section, that the public health, safety or welfare requires emergency action and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, the board may restrict, limit or order a summary suspension of a license pending proceedings for revocation or other action.  If the board takes action pursuant to this subsection, it shall also serve the licensee with a written notice that states the charges and that the licensee is entitled to a formal hearing before the board or an administrative law judge within sixty days.

C. If, after completing its investigation, the board finds that the information provided pursuant to subsection A of this section is not of sufficient seriousness to merit disciplinary action against the license of the licensee, the board or a board committee may take any of the following nondisciplinary actions:

1. Dismiss if, in the opinion of the board, the information is without merit.

2. File an advisory letter.  The licensee may file a written response with the board within thirty days after receiving the advisory letter.

3. Issue a nondisciplinary order requiring the licensee to complete a prescribed number of hours of continuing education in an area or areas prescribed by the board to provide the licensee with the necessary understanding of current developments, skills, procedures or treatment.

D. If the board finds that it can take rehabilitative or disciplinary action without the presence of the licensee at a formal interview, it may enter into a consent agreement with the licensee to limit or restrict the licensee's practice or to rehabilitate the licensee, protect the public and ensure the licensee's ability to safely engage in the practice of massage therapy.  The board may also require the licensee to successfully complete a board approved rehabilitative, retraining, continuing education or assessment program.

E. If, after completing its investigation, the board believes that the information is or may be true, it may request a formal interview with the licensee.  If the licensee refuses the invitation for a formal interview or accepts and the results indicate that grounds may exist for revocation or suspension of the licensee's license for more than twelve months, the board shall issue a formal complaint and order that a hearing be held pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  If, after completing a formal interview, the board finds that the protection of the public requires emergency action, it may order a summary suspension of the license pending formal revocation proceedings or other action authorized by this section.

F. If, after completing the formal interview, the board finds the information provided under subsection A of this section is not of sufficient seriousness to merit suspension for more than twelve months or revocation of the license, it may take one or more of the following actions:

1. Dismiss if, in the opinion of the board, the complaint is without merit.

2. File an advisory letter.  The licensee may file a written response with the board within thirty days after the licensee receives the advisory letter.

3. File a letter of reprimand.

4. Issue a decree of censure.  A decree of censure is an official action against the licensee's license.

5. Fix a period and terms of probation best adapted to protect the public health and safety and to rehabilitate or educate the licensee concerned.  Probation may include temporary suspension not to exceed twelve months or restriction of the licensee's license to practice massage therapy. If a licensee fails to comply with the terms of probation, the board shall serve the licensee with a written notice that states that the licensee is subject to a formal hearing based on the information considered by the board at the formal interview and on any other acts or conduct alleged to be in violation of this chapter or rules adopted pursuant to this chapter, including noncompliance with the terms of probation, a consent agreement or a stipulated agreement.

6. Enter into an agreement with the licensee to restrict or limit the licensee's practice in order to rehabilitate, retrain or assess the licensee, protect the public and ensure the licensee's ability to safely engage in the practice of massage therapy.

7. Order the payment of restitution, including an order to repay fees paid by a massage therapy client and for the cost of the investigation.

8. Issue a nondisciplinary order requiring the licensee to complete a prescribed number of hours of continuing education in an area or areas prescribed by the board to provide the licensee with the necessary understanding of current developments, skills, procedures or treatment.

G. If the board finds that the information provided in subsection A or E of this section warrants suspension or revocation of a license issued pursuant to this chapter, it shall initiate formal proceedings pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  If after a formal proceeding the board finds that a licensee has been convicted of prostitution, solicitation or another similar offense, the board shall revoke the license.

H. A licensee shall respond in writing to the board within thirty days after notice of the hearing is served.  The board may consider a licensee's failure to respond within this time as an admission by default to the allegations stated in the complaint. The board may then take any disciplinary action allowed pursuant to this chapter without conducting a hearing.

I. In a formal interview pursuant to subsection E of this section or in a hearing pursuant to subsection G of this section, the board in addition to any other action may impose a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars for each violation of this chapter or a rule adopted pursuant to this chapter.

J. An advisory letter is a public document.

K. A licensee who after a formal hearing is found by the board to be subject to discipline pursuant to this chapter is subject to censure, probation or restitution as provided in this section, suspension or revocation of license or any combination of these, including a stay of action, for a period of time or permanently and under conditions the board deems appropriate for the protection of the public health and safety and just in the circumstance.  The board may charge the costs of formal hearings to a licensee whom it finds to be in violation of this chapter.

L. If the board, during the course of any investigation, determines that a criminal violation involving the practice of massage therapy may have occurred, it shall make the evidence of a violation available to the appropriate criminal justice agency for its consideration.

M. The board shall deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, all monies it collects from civil penalties paid pursuant to this section in the state general fund.

N. Notice of a complaint and hearing is effective by a true copy of it being sent by certified mail to the licensee's last known address of record in the board's files.  Notice of the complaint and hearing is complete on the date of its deposit in the mail.  The board shall begin a formal hearing within one hundred twenty days after that date.

O. The board may accept the surrender of a license from a person who admits in writing to any of the following:

1. Being unable to safely engage in the practice of massage therapy.

2. Having committed an act subject to discipline pursuant to this chapter.

3. Having violated this chapter or a board rule.
