Notice: The organization facilitating the sharing of medical expenses is not an insurance company and the ministry's guidelines and plan of operation are not an insurance policy. Whether anyone chooses to assist you with your medical bills will be completely voluntary because participants are not compelled by law to contribute toward your medical bills.  Therefore, participation in the ministry or a subscription to any of its documents should not be considered to be insurance.

#### Section 20-169. Supervision by director

Notwithstanding any other law, if on examination pursuant to this article or at any other time it appears to or is in the opinion of the director that any insurance company is insolvent, or its condition is such as to render the continuance of its business hazardous to the public or to holders of its policies or certificates of insurance, or if the insurance company appears to have exceeded its powers or has failed to comply with the law, or if the insurance company gives its consent, the director, on the director's determination, shall do all of the following:

1. Notify the insurance company of the director's determination.

2. Furnish to the insurance company a written list of the director's requirements to abate the determination.

3. If the director makes a further determination to supervise, the director shall notify the insurance company that it is under the supervision of the department of insurance and financial institutions and that the director is applying and effecting the provisions of this article. The insurance company shall comply with the lawful requirements of the director and, if placed under supervision, shall under supervision have sixty days from the date of notice within which to comply with the requirements of the director, subject to the provisions of this article. If the insurance company fails to comply within such time, the director, or a conservator appointed by the director for that purpose, shall immediately, after due and proper notice and hearing, take charge as conservator of the insurance company and all of the property and effects of the insurance company.

#### Section 20-170. Prohibited acts during sixty day period of supervision

During the period of supervision, the director may appoint a supervisor to supervise such insurance company and may provide that the insurance company may not do any of the following things, during the period of supervision, without the prior approval of the director or his supervisor:

1. Dispose of, convey or encumber any of its assets or its business in force;

2. Withdraw any of its bank accounts;

8. Enter into any new reinsurance contract or treaty.

#### Section 20-171. Conservatorship; liquidation

A. If, after notice, and after hearing, at the conclusion of the sixty day period, it is determined that such insurance company has failed to comply with the lawful requirements of the director or upon consent by an insurance company, the director may appoint a conservator, who shall immediately take charge of such insurance company and all of the property, books, records, and effects thereof, and conduct the business thereof, and take such steps toward the removal of the causes and conditions, which have necessitated such order, as the director may direct. During the pendency of conservatorship, the conservator shall make such reports to the director from time to time as may be required by the director and shall be empowered to take all necessary measures to preserve, protect, and recover any assets or property of such insurance company, including claims or causes of action belonging to or which may be asserted by such insurance company, and to deal with the same in his own name as conservator, and shall be empowered to file, prosecute, and defend any suit or suits which have been filed or which may thereafter be filed by or against such insurance company which are deemed by the conservator to be necessary to protect all of the interested parties or any property affected thereby. If at the time of appointment of a conservator or at any time during the pendency of such conservatorship it appears that the interest of the policyholders or certificate holders of such insurance company can best be protected by reinsuring the same, the conservator may, with the approval of or at the direction of the director:

1. Reinsure all or any part of such insurance company's policies or certificates of insurance with some solvent insurance company authorized to transact business in this state, and

2. To the extent that such insurance company in conservatorship is possessed of reserves attributable to such policies or certificates of insurance, the conservator may transfer to the reinsuring company such reserves or any portion thereof as may be required to consummate the reinsurance of such policies, and any such reserves so transferred shall not be deemed a preference of creditors.

B. If the director is satisfied that such insurance company is not in condition to continue business in the interest of its policy or certificate holders, under the conservator as above provided, the director shall give notice to the attorney general who shall thereupon apply to any court in Arizona having jurisdiction thereof for leave to file a suit in the nature of quo warranto to forfeit the certificate of authority of such insurance company or to require it to comply with the law or to satisfy the director as to its solvency, and to satisfy the requirement that its condition is such as to render the continuance of its business not hazardous to the public or to the holders of its policies or certificates of insurance. It shall be in the discretion of the director to determine whether or not he will operate the insurance company through a conservator, or report it to the attorney general. When all the policies of an insurance company are reinsured or terminated, and all of its affairs concluded, the director shall report the same to the attorney general, who shall take such action as may be necessary to effect the forfeiture or cancellation of the certificate of authority of the insurance company so reinsured and liquidated. Where the director lends his approval to the merger, consolidation or reinsurance of all the policies of one insurance company with that of another, the same shall be reported to the attorney general who shall proceed to effect the forfeiture or cancellation of the certificate of authority of the insurance company from which the policies were merged, consolidated or reinsured, in the same manner as is provided for the charters of companies totally reinsured or liquidated.

C. The cost incident to the supervisor's and conservator's service shall be fixed and determined by the director and shall be a charge against the assets and funds of the insurance company to be allowed and paid as the director may determine.

 

#### Section 20-172. Possession by director of person transacting insurance prior to appointment of receiver; powers of director in possession; stay of possession order; application to title insurance

A. The director may, upon submission of a verified petition stating that an insurer is in such an unsafe or unsound condition that it is or will become unable to meet the anticipated demands of its policyholders and that the condition cannot be corrected by the procedures of sections 20-169, 20-170 or 20-171, obtain an order from the superior court allowing the director to immediately take possession and control of the insurer pending a hearing on the appointment of a receiver. The superior court shall immediately consider the director's petition and shall immediately issue without notice to the affected party such order unless the verified petition filed by the director is faulty. After the order is granted, the director shall immediately, through the attorney general, apply to the superior court for the appointment of a receiver for the insurer. If at any time the court finds that no ground for receivership exists, the receivership shall be dissolved and the director's possession terminated.

B. When the director has taken possession of an insurer and until either the appointment and qualification of the receiver or the adjudication that no ground for the receivership exists, the director shall be vested with the full and exclusive power of management and control. The director shall have the power to continue or to discontinue the business, to stop or to limit the payment of its obligations, to employ any necessary assistants, to execute any instrument in the name of the insurer and to commence, defend and conduct in its name any action or proceeding in which the insurer may be a party.

C. An order issued by the director pursuant to this section shall not be stayed except by order of the superior court and upon the giving of security by the applicant in such sum as will be adequate to protect the insurer's policyholders.

D. The provisions of this section shall apply to all types of insurers including title insurers, hospital service corporations, medical service corporations, dental service corporations, optometric service corporations, and health care service organizations.

#### Section 20-173. Residence requirement; exemption for officer representing insurer

Notwithstanding the provision of section 38-201, subsection A, to the contrary, a member of a guaranty fund board established pursuant to this title, chapter 3, article 6 or 7, who is appointed to represent an insurer or group of insurers, need not be a resident of this state.

### Article 3 - Mandated Health Coverage

#### Section 20-181. Mandated health coverage; report

An organization or individual advocating a legislative proposal that would mandate a health coverage or offering of a health coverage by an insurer, hospital, medical, dental or optometric service corporation, health care services organization or any other health care service contractor as a component of individual or group policies shall submit a report pursuant to section 20-183.  The report shall assess both the social and financial impacts of such coverage, including the effectiveness of the treatment or service proposed, according to the factors prescribed in section 20-182.

 

#### Section 20-182. Factors for assessing impact; certification of report

A. To the extent that information is available, the report prescribed by section 20-181 shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

1. The social impact:

(a) The extent to which the treatment or service is generally utilized by a significant portion of the population.

(b) The extent to which the insurance coverage is already generally available.

(c) If coverage is not generally available, the extent to which the lack of coverage results in persons avoiding necessary health care treatments.

(d) If the coverage is not generally available, the extent to which the lack of coverage results in unreasonable financial hardship to a patient.

(e) The level of public demand for the treatment or service.

(f) The level of public demand for insurance coverage of the treatment or service.

(g) The level of interest of collective bargaining agents in negotiating privately for inclusion of this coverage in group contracts.

2. The financial impact:

(a) The extent to which the coverage will increase or decrease the cost of the treatment or service.

(b) The extent to which the coverage will increase the appropriate use of the treatment or service.

(c) The extent to which the mandated treatment or service will be a substitute for a more expensive treatment or service.

(d) The extent to which the coverage will increase or decrease the administrative expenses of insurers and the premium and administrative expenses of policyholders.

(e) The impact of this coverage on the total cost of health care.

B. An actuary who is a member of the American academy of actuaries shall prepare the financial impact analysis required by subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section and certify that the analysis is consistent with accepted actuarial techniques.

C. The report required by section 20-181 shall address the specific language of the proposed mandate.  A report on a similar proposal in a different jurisdiction is insufficient and does not meet the requirements of section 20-181.

D. An organization, individual or legislator that does not submit a report required by section 20-181 is not subject to any civil sanction or criminal penalty.

 

#### Section 20-183. Report procedures and deadlines

A person or a legislator advocating a legislative proposal pursuant to section 20-181 shall submit a written report explaining the factors prescribed in section 20-182 to the joint legislative audit committee established by section 41-1279.  The report must be submitted on or before September 1 before the start of the legislative session for which the legislation is proposed. The joint legislative audit committee shall assign the written report to the appropriate legislative committee of reference established pursuant to section 41-2954. The legislative committee of reference shall hold at least one hearing and take public testimony after receiving the report. The legislative committee of reference shall study the written report and deliver a report of its recommendations to the joint legislative audit committee, the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate, the governor and the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions on or before December 1 of the year in which the report is submitted.

### Article 4 - Payment of Premiums

#### Section 20-191. Payment of premiums by mail; date of payment

A. Any payment of insurance premium that is deposited, properly addressed and postage prepaid, in an official depository of the United States mail on or before the date the premium is due is deemed timely payment of the premium on the date shown by the postmark or other official mark of the United States mail stamped on the payment envelope. An insurer may establish the postmark date by retaining the postmarked payment envelope. If the insurer does not retain the envelope or the postmark date on the envelope is illegible, the payment date is presumed to be five mail days before the date the insurer receives the payment. An insurer may establish the date of receipt by a record generated in the course of regularly conducted business. For the purposes of this subsection, "mail days" means days on which the United States postal service performs regular mail delivery.

B. If a payment described in subsection A is sent by United States certified or registered mail or certificate of mailing, the date of the registration, certification or certificate, as established by a record authenticated by proper officials of the United States mail, is deemed the date of payment.

C. If the due date of a payment described in subsection A falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the payment is considered timely if sent on the next business day.

B. A domestic insurer, including a domestic limited stock insurer subject to the capital and surplus requirements prescribed in subsection D of this section, holding a valid certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of the kind or kinds as set forth in subsection A prior to the effective date of this section, may, if otherwise qualified, continue to be so authorized while possessing the amount of paid-in capital stock, if a stock insurer, or surplus, if a mutual insurer, required by the laws of this state for such authority immediately prior to the effective date of this section. The director shall not grant such an insurer authority to transact any other or additional kinds of insurance unless such insurer fully complies with the requirements as to capital and surplus, as applied to all kinds of insurance which the insurer proposes to transact, as provided by this section for like insurers applying for original certificates of authority under this title. Upon a change in the control of such an insurer, such insurer shall within one year from the effective date of such change in control meet the capital and surplus requirements for new insurers pursuant to subsection A of this section. For the purposes of this subsection "control" shall have the same meaning and be determined in the same manner as prescribed in section 20-481.

C. Capital and surplus requirements are based upon all kinds of insurance transacted by the insurer in all areas in which the insurer operates or proposes to operate whether or not only a portion of such kinds are to be transacted in this state.

D. Notwithstanding the limitation in the first sentence of subsection B of this section on increased capitalization for authorized insurers, any domestic limited stock insurer which on January 31, 1969 was the holder of a valid certificate of authority shall not be required to meet the capital and initial free surplus requirement of this section, but after January 31, 1980, any such domestic limited stock insurer shall possess and thereafter maintain:

1. Minimum paid-in capital stock of one hundred thousand dollars, and

2. Surplus funds in an amount of not less than one-half such minimum paid-in capital. On and after the effective date of this section any domestic limited stock insurer which holds a valid certificate of authority immediately prior to such effective date and which qualified under the provisions of subsection B of section 20-708 and whose premium income as a direct writer during calendar year 1976 did not exceed fifty per cent of its total premium income including reinsurance premiums from insurance policies and contracts for such year, shall be a domestic life and disability reinsurer and be subject to the provisions of article 10, of chapter 4 of this title.

#### Section 20-211. Surplus required

A. In addition to the minimum required capital stock, if a stock insurer, or minimum required basic surplus, if mutual or reciprocal insurers, as required by sections 20-210 and 20-212 as to all stock insurers and foreign and alien mutual and reciprocal insurers, by sections 20-768 and 20-212 as to domestic reciprocal insurers, and section 20-711, subsection B and section 20-212 as to domestic mutual insurers, except as stated in subsection C of this section, any foreign or alien insurer, any title insurer, and any domestic insurer shall possess at the time of original authorization in this state initial free surplus as stated in section 20-210, and shall maintain free surplus funds in an amount of not less than one-half such initial free surplus. No other insurer shall be so initially authorized in this state unless it then possesses surplus of not less than initial free surplus as stated in section 20-210, in addition to the minimum required capital stock, if a stock insurer, or minimum required basic surplus, if mutual or reciprocal insurers, otherwise required.

B. In addition to the minimum required capital stock if the insurer is a stock insurer or in addition to the minimum required basic surplus if the insurer is a mutual or reciprocal insurer under this article and chapter 4, article 1 of this title, a domestic, foreign or alien insurer shall possess and maintain any additional free surplus that the director may require based on the type, volume or nature of its business as a necessary condition to avoid rendering its transaction of insurance hazardous to its policyholders or the people of this state. The director shall adopt rules to implement the provisions of this subsection.

C. Subsection A of this section shall not apply to a domestic mutual insurer which qualifies upon the basis of applications for insurance as provided in section 20-711, nor to reinsurers which qualify pursuant to chapter 4, article 10 of this title and which do not within such five year period transact any kind of insurance in addition to that for which initially authorized.

#### Section 20-212. Funds required to transact additional kinds of insurance

An insurer otherwise qualified may be authorized to transact combinations of kinds of insurance, other than the life and disability combination shown in section 20-210, while possessing and maintaining thereafter additional minimum required capital stock, if a stock insurer, or additional minimum required basic surplus, if a mutual or reciprocal insurer, not less in amount than that determined as follows: For any lawful combination add two hundred thousand dollars for each additional kind of insurance included in the combination to the amount required under section 20-210 for that one kind of insurance in the combination for which the largest amount is required under said section 20- 210, except:

1. Vehicle and disability insurances may be combined with casualty, and in any combination including casualty, without funds in addition to those required because of casualty.

2. With such additional minimum required capital stock or such additional minimum required basic surplus in an amount of not less than five hundred thousand dollars, an insurer, if otherwise qualified, may be authorized to transact all kinds of insurance except life and title insurance. Any domestic stock insurer which on January 1, 1954, was lawfully authorized to transact vehicle insurance, for physical damage only, or casualty insurance, and while possessing paid-in capital of not less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars, may be so authorized to transact all kinds of insurance other than life and title insurances.

3. The amount of such capital or surplus shall not in any event be less than would be required if the insurer proposed to transact in this state all those kinds of insurance which it is transacting elsewhere.

#### Section 20-213. Deposit requirements

The director shall not issue a certificate of authority to any insurer unless it has deposited in trust with the state treasurer through the director's office cash or securities eligible for the investment of capital funds of domestic insurers under this title in an amount not less than the minimum required capital stock, if a stock insurer, or minimum required basic surplus, if a mutual or reciprocal insurer, required pursuant to this article to be maintained for authority to transact the kinds of insurance to be transacted, except:

1. As to life and disability carriers there shall be maintained with the state treasurer or a trustee approved by the director, a deposit in cash, surety bond or securities as described in sections 20-537 through 20-548 and sections 20-551 through 20-556, in an amount equal to the greatest of:

(a) Minimum required capital stock or minimum required basic surplus pursuant to section 20-210.

(b) Two-thirds of the aggregate reserves as computed under section 20-510.

(c) Twenty-five per cent of the earned premium of the prior year.

2. As to title insurers, the deposit shall be in such amount as is required by article 9 of chapter 6 of this title.

3.

Every insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies shall make available to the named insured thereunder and by written notice offer the named insured and at the request of the named insured shall include within the policy uninsured motorist coverage that extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy, in limits not less than the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the policy. The offer of limits to a named insured or applicant shall be made on a form approved by the director. An insurance producer that uses such a form in offering uninsured motorist coverage satisfies the insurance producer's standard of care in offering and explaining the nature and applicability of uninsured motorist coverage. The policy declarations page must be sent to the named insured, constitutes the final expression of the named insured's decision to purchase or reject uninsured motorist coverage and is valid for, extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy. An offer form is not required where the named insured purchases such coverage in an amount equal to the limits for bodily injury or death contained in the policy.  The offer need not be made in the event of the reinstatement of a lapsed policy or the transfer, substitution, modification or renewal of an existing policy or as a result of a change to the minimum liability limits for bodily injury or death prescribed in section 28-4009. At the request of the named insured, the named insured may purchase and the insurer shall then include within the policy uninsured motorist coverage that extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy in any amount up to the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the policy but not less than the limits prescribed in section 28-4009.

B. Every insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies shall also make available to the named insured thereunder and shall by written notice offer the named insured and at the request of the named insured shall include within the policy underinsured motorist coverage that extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy, in limits not less than the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the policy. The offer of limits to a named insured or applicant shall be made on a form approved by the director. An insurance producer that uses such a form in offering underinsured motorist coverage satisfies the insurance producer's standard of care in offering and explaining the nature and applicability of underinsured motorist coverage. The policy declarations page must be sent to the named insured, constitutes the final expression of the named insured's decision to purchase or reject underinsured motorist coverage and is valid for, extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy. An offer form is not required where the named insured purchases such coverage in an amount equal to the limits for bodily injury or death contained in the policy. The offer need not be made in the event of the reinstatement of a lapsed policy or the transfer, substitution, modification or renewal of an existing policy or as a result of a change to the minimum liability limits for bodily injury or death prescribed in section 28-4009. At the request of the named insured, the named insured may purchase and the insurer shall then include within the policy underinsured motorist coverage that extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy in any amount authorized by the insured up to the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the policy.

C. Any insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies may make available the coverages required by subsections A and B of this section to owners and operators of motor vehicles that are used as public or livery conveyances or rented to others or that are used in the business primarily to transport property or equipment. Subsections A and B of this section do not preclude an insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies in this state from requiring that all motor vehicles that are owned by or registered to the named insured and that are insured by the same insurer or group of insurers under a common management have the same limits of coverage for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage in amounts as selected or rejected by the named insured.

D. "Uninsured motor vehicles", subject to the terms and conditions of that coverage, includes any insured motor vehicle if the liability insurer of the vehicle is unable to make payment on the liability of its insured, within the limits of the coverage, because of insolvency.

E. "Uninsured motorist coverage", subject to the terms and conditions of that coverage, means coverage for damages due to bodily injury or death if the motor vehicle that caused the bodily injury or death is not insured by a motor vehicle liability policy that contains at least the limits prescribed in section 28-4009. For the purposes of uninsured motorist coverage, an uninsured motorist does not include a person who is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy that complies with section 28-4009.

F. Any payment made under the bodily injury liability portion of a motor vehicle liability policy insuring the motor vehicle that caused the bodily injury or death in an amount equal to or less than the per person or per occurrence bodily injury limits of that policy, regardless of the number of persons receiving payments, precludes any payment under the uninsured motorist coverage based on the fault of the person who is insured under the motor vehicle liability policy.

G. "Underinsured motorist coverage" includes coverage for a person if the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury or death liability bonds and liability insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the total damages for bodily injury or death resulting from the accident. To the extent that the total damages exceed the total applicable liability limits, the underinsured motorist coverage provided in subsection B of this section is applicable to the difference.

H. Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages are separate and distinct and apply to different accident situations. Underinsured motorist coverage shall not provide coverage for a claim against an uninsured motorist in addition to any applicable uninsured motorist coverage. If multiple policies or coverages purchased by one insured on different vehicles apply to an accident or claim, the insurer may limit the coverage so that only one policy or coverage, selected by the insured, shall be applicable to any one accident. If the policy does not contain a statement that informs the insured of the insured's right to select one policy or coverage as required by this subsection, within thirty days after the insurer receives notice of an accident, the insurer shall notify the insured in writing of the insured's right to select one policy or coverage. For the purposes of this subsection, "insurer" includes every insurer within a group of insurers under a common management.

I. Insurers that make payments for damages to insureds for uninsured motorist coverage may subrogate and sue for reimbursement of the total amount of the payments in the name of the insured against any uninsured motorist responsible for the damages to the insured.

Any automobile liability or motor vehicle liability insurer that makes a payment under the medical payments coverage of a motor vehicle insurance policy to or on behalf of any insured for an injury that arises out of an accident that occurs after December 31, 1998 may have a lien against any amount in excess of $5,000 that is paid to or on behalf of that insured under the medical payments coverage of the policy for that accident. The insurer shall compromise the lien in a fair and equitable manner. In order to perfect a lien granted pursuant to this subsection, within sixty days after issuing a payment that is more than $5,000 to the insured under medical payments coverage, the insurer or the insurer's authorized representative shall record in the office of the recorder of the county in which the accident occurred a written statement that sets forth the name and address of the insured as they appear in the records of the insurer, the name and address of the insurer at the insurer's principal office in this state, the amount claimed pursuant to this subsection and, to the best of the insurer's knowledge, the names and addresses of all persons, firms and corporations and their insurance carriers that the insured or the insured's legal representative alleges are liable for damages arising from the accident. Within five days after recording the lien, the insurer shall also mail a copy of the lien, postage prepaid, to the insured and to each person, firm and corporation and their insurance carriers alleged to be liable for damages at the address given in the statement. The recording of the lien is notice of the lien to all persons, firms and corporations that are liable for damages regardless of whether they are named in the lien. The recorder shall endorse on the lien recorded pursuant to this subsection the date and hour of receipt and all facts that are necessary to indicate that the lien has been recorded. The lien may be amended to reflect payments to the insured made after the lien is recorded. Within thirty days after the lien is satisfied, the lienholder shall issue and record a release of the lien.

K. Any common law prohibition against assignments of causes of action for personal injuries is abrogated to the extent provided in subsection I of this section.

L. An insurer is not required to offer, provide or make available coverage conforming to this section in connection with any general commercial liability policy, excess policy, umbrella policy or other policy that does not provide primary motor vehicle insurance for liabilities arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of a specifically insured motor vehicle.

M. If an insured makes a bodily injury or death claim under uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage based on an accident that involved an unidentified motor vehicle and no physical contact with the motor vehicle occurred, the insured shall provide corroboration that the unidentified motor vehicle caused the accident. For the purposes of this subsection, "corroboration" means any additional and confirming testimony, fact or evidence that strengthens and adds weight or credibility to the insured's representation of the accident.

#### Section 20-259.02. Coverage to include car pool operators and car pool vehicles; definitions

A. A policy of private passenger vehicle insurance shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless coverage is provided for the protection of any person insured under such policy while such person is acting as a car pool operator, and for the protection of any vehicle insured under such policy while such vehicle is, or while it is being operated as, a car pool vehicle. Such car pool coverage shall not entail a premium higher than the premium would otherwise have been for such private passenger vehicle.

B. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Car pool operator" has the same meaning prescribed in section 28-4032.

2. "Car pool vehicle" means any motor vehicle when operated by a car pool operator.

3. "Private passenger vehicle" includes a vehicle accommodating no more than fifteen passengers and owned by a commercial organization but used exclusively as a car pool vehicle.

#### Section 20-259.03. Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages; insured; wrongful death recovery

Notwithstanding any other law, in the case of the death of an insured who is covered under the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages of a motor vehicle liability policy, recovery for wrongful death is limited to any party who is qualified to bring a wrongful death action pursuant to section 12-612 and who is also a surviving insured under the same coverages of the policy. If there are no surviving insureds who qualify to bring a wrongful death action pursuant to section 12-612, the estate of the deceased insured maintains the right of recovery against the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages of the motor vehicle policy.

#### Section 20-260. Limit of risk

A. No insurer shall retain any risk on any one subject of insurance, whether located or to be performed in this state or elsewhere, in an amount exceeding ten per cent of its surplus to policyholders, except that a domestic mutual insurer holding a certificate of authority may retain up to such ten per cent or up to the maximum applicable as set forth in section 20-711, whichever is the larger, and a domestic limited stock insurer may retain up to the maximum applicable as set forth in section 20-708.

B. Reinsurance authorized by section 20-261 shall be deducted in determining risk retained.

F. "Surplus to policyholders" for the purpose of this section shall be deemed to include any voluntary reserves which are not required pursuant to law, and shall be determined from the last sworn statement of the insurer on file with the director or by the last report of examination by the director, whichever is the more recent at time of assumption of such risk.

#### Section 20-261. Authorized reinsurance

A. An insurer shall reinsure its risks, or any part of its risks, only in solvent insurers having surplus to policyholders not less in amount than the minimum required capital stock required under this title of a domestic stock insurer, other than a limited stock insurer or a domestic life and disability reinsurer, authorized to transact like kinds of insurance. A domestic limited stock life insurer or domestic life and disability reinsurer may accept reinsurance of the risks of other limited stock insurers or domestic life and disability reinsurers.

B. An insurer may reinsure in alien insurers if the alien insurers are authorized to transact insurance in at least one state of the United States or have in the United States a duly authorized attorney-in-fact to accept service of legal process against the insurer as to any liability that might arise on account of such reinsurance.

C. A credit shall not be allowed, as an admitted asset or as a deduction from liability, to any ceding insurer for reinsurance unless the reinsurance is payable by the reinsurer on the basis of the liability of the ceding insurer under the contracts reinsured without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding insurer nor unless under the reinsurance contract the reinsurer assumes the liability for the reinsurance as of the same effective date. The reinsurer shall make payment directly to the ceding insurer or to its statutory successor by whatever name called for the purpose of liquidating or rehabilitating the business of the insurer unless either the reinsurance contract or the policies reinsured required the reinsurer to make payment to the payees under the policies reinsured in the event the ceding insurer becomes insolvent, or the reinsurer with the consent of the direct insured assumes the policy obligations of the ceding insurer to the payees under the policies reinsured in substitution for the obligations of the ceding insurer to those payees.

D. A domestic insurer shall not be a party to any agreement of reinsurance with an unauthorized insurer until the agreement is filed with and approved in writing by the director. The director shall approve the agreement within a reasonable time after filing unless in the director's opinion the effect of the agreement would be to reduce protection or service substantially either to policyholders resident of this state or to policyholders anywhere of the domestic insurer.  If the director does not approve the agreement, the director shall notify the domestic insurer in writing specifying the reasons for not approving the agreement.

No rate shall be held to be inadequate unless the director finds that the loss experience of the insurer in the classification covered by the rate has been adverse for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the date of such finding.

2. Due consideration shall be given to past and prospective loss experience within and outside this state, to catastrophe hazards, if any, to a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, to dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers, to past and prospective expenses within and outside this state and to all other relevant factors within and outside this state.

3. The systems of expense provisions included in the rates for use by any insurer or group of insurers may differ from those of other insurers or groups of insurers to reflect the requirements of the operating methods of any such insurer or group with respect to any kind of insurance, or with respect to any subdivision or combination thereof for which subdivision or combination separate expense provisions are applicable.

4. Risks may be grouped by classifications for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classification rates may be modified to produce rates for individual risks in accordance with rating plans which establish standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both. Such standards may measure any differences among risks that can be demonstrated to have a probable effect upon losses or expenses.

5. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prohibit payment of dividends by insurers issuing policies on the participating plan, or by mutual or reciprocal insurers, but in the payment of such dividends there shall be no unfair discrimination between policyholders.

6. Except to the extent necessary to meet the provisions of paragraph 1, uniformity among insurers in any matters within the scope of this section is neither required nor prohibited.

#### Section 20-357. Filing of rating system; definition

A. Every insurer shall file with the director the rating systems the insurer proposes to use.  As used in the rate regulatory provisions of this article, "rating systems" includes every manual of classifications, rules and rates, every rating plan and every modification of any of the foregoing. Every filing shall have a proposed effective date and shall indicate the character and extent of the coverage contemplated.  If a filing does not include the information on which the insurer supports the filing, and the director does not have sufficient information to determine whether the filing meets the rate regulatory requirements of this article, the director shall require the insurer to furnish information supporting the filing.  The supporting information may include the experience or judgment of the insurer or rating organization making the filing, its interpretation of any statistical data on which it relies, the experience of other insurers or rating organizations or any other relevant factors.  A filing and any supporting information shall be open to public inspection after the filing becomes effective.

B. A workers' compensation insurer shall satisfy its obligation to make filings by becoming a member of a licensed rating organization that makes filings and by authorizing the director to accept on its behalf filings made by the rating organization.  A rating organization shall annually file with the director rates to be effective on January 1. Nothing in this subsection requires an insurer to be a member of the designated rating organization.

C. Each filing shall be on file for a waiting period of at least thirty days before it becomes effective.  On written application by the insurer or rating organization making the filing, the director may authorize a filing to become effective before the waiting period expires.

D. On written application of the insured that states the insured's reasons and that is filed with and approved by the director, an insurer may use a rate in excess of the insurer's filed rate on the insured's risk.

E. An insurer shall not make or issue a contract or policy except in accordance with the filings in effect for that insurer as provided in the rate regulatory provisions of this article.

 

#### Section 20-358. Disapproval of rates

A. If at any time the director finds that a filing does not meet the standards set forth in section 20-356, he shall, after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice, in which he shall specify the matters to be considered at such hearing, to every insurer and rating organization which made the filing, issue an order specifying in what respects he finds that the filing fails to meet the requirements of the rate regulatory provisions of this article, and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the filing or rating system shall be deemed no longer effective. Copies of the order shall be sent to every such insurer and rating organization. The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth therein.

B. Any person or organization aggrieved with respect to any filing or rating system which is in effect may make written application to the director for a hearing thereon, but the insurer or rating organization which made the filing or uses the rating system shall not be authorized to proceed under this subsection. The application shall specify the grounds to be relied upon by the applicant. If the director finds that the application is made in good faith, that the applicant would be so aggrieved if his grounds are established and that the grounds otherwise justify holding such a hearing, he shall within thirty days after receipt of the application hold a hearing upon not less than ten days' written notice to the applicant and to every insurer and rating organization which made such filing or uses such rating system. If, after the hearing, the director finds that the filing or rating system does not meet the requirements of the rate regulatory provisions of this article, he shall issue an order specifying in what respects he finds that it fails to meet such requirements and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, it shall be deemed no longer effective. Copies of the order shall be sent to the applicant and to every such insurer and rating organization. The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth therein.

C. No manual of classifications, rules, rating plan or any modification of any of the foregoing which establishes standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both, and which is being used pursuant to the requirements of section 20-356, shall be disapproved if the rates thereby produced meet the requirements of the rate regulatory provisions of this article.

D. The director may utilize independent contractor examiners experienced in the review of applicable rates and reserves pursuant to sections 20-148 and 20-159 to implement the provisions of this article. All examination and examination related expenses shall be borne by the insurer and shall be paid by the insurance examiners' revolving fund pursuant to section 20-159.

#### Section 20-359. Deviations from filed workers' compensation rates

A. Every insurer shall adhere to the filings made by the rating organization of which it is a member, except that any member insurer may file with the director:

1. Up to six uniform percentage deviations that decrease or increase the statewide rate portion of the rating organization's rate filing. If more than one deviation is filed by an insurer, each deviation must be established consistent with the underwriting rules that are based on criteria that would lead to a logical distinction of potential risk.

2. A subclassification rate related rule that deviates from the rules or schedule rating plan filed by the insurer's rating organization.  An insurer shall not simultaneously apply a deviation and a schedule rating to the same insured risk.

B. In addition to the six uniform percentage deviations authorized under subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, insurers covering firefighters and fire investigators may file one uniform percentage deviation that increases the statewide rates under the rating organization's rate filing for the class codes associated with firefighters and fire investigators to address the anticipated increase in losses and expenses for claims that are compensable pursuant to section 23-901.09.  The deviation filing shall be accompanied by analysis from an actuary that substantively illustrates the basis for the rate increase, including information made available by the industrial commission of Arizona pursuant to section 23-971 and the anticipated and, when available, actual combined loss ratio, claim frequency and claim severity associated with these claims.  The supporting documentation submitted with the filing must be sufficient to allow the department to assess the reasonableness of the insurer's assumptions and justification for the deviation and shall include data related to workers' compensation indemnity and medical claims and administrative expenses associated specifically with presumptive coverage related to workers' compensation claims. The insurer may use data or analysis from any of the following sources:

1. The insured or insurer.

2. Self-funded employers providing workers' compensation.

3. The industrial commission of Arizona.

4. A risk retention pool.

5. Studies and information illustrating the state and national frequency of cancer among firefighters and fire investigators.

6. The assigned risk pool or assigned risk.

7. Claims and expense data from other relevant lines of insurance such as long-term disability insurance, group or individual major medical insurance or long-term care insurance.

8. Other available cancer-related statistics.

9. Relevant incurred but not reported workers' compensation claims data.

C. The director may use independent contractor examiners to analyze the supporting justification of a requested deviation under subsection B of this section pursuant to section 20-358, subsection D.

D. Notwithstanding subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section, in addition to the deviation filing authorized under subsection B of this section, insurers may file and apply a schedule rating plan to adjust premiums associated with firefighters and fire investigators class codes, based on loss control programs or activities undertaken by the insurer to reduce losses associated with section 23-901.09.  The schedule rating plan must be filed with and approved by the director and shall be in addition to and separate from any other schedule rating plan available to the insurer.

E. Each deviation filed shall be on file with the director for a waiting period of at least thirty days before it becomes effective, except that a deviation filed pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be on file with the director for at least sixty days before it becomes effective. On written application by the insurer making the filing, the director may authorize a filing to become effective before the waiting period expires. A deviation that is filed pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section and that is not disapproved by the director expires the following December 31 at midnight in this state unless the director terminates the deviation sooner. A deviation that is filed pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section continues until the insurer withdraws the deviation or the director determines that the deviation no longer meets the standards prescribed in section 20-356, paragraph 1. At any time the director may require an insurer to actuarially support a deviation. The insurer that files the deviation shall simultaneously send a copy of the filing to the rating organization of which it is a member and to any designated rating organization.

F. A rating organization shall notify the director if the organization disapproves any deviation relating to workers' compensation insurance. The director shall notify the industrial commission of Arizona of the disapproval within ten days after receipt of the disapproval from the rating organization.

#### Section 20-361. Licensing of rating organizations

A. A corporation, an unincorporated association, a partnership or an individual, whether located within or outside this state, may apply to the director for a license as a rating organization for insurance subject to this article and shall file all of the following with the director:

1. A copy of its constitution, its articles of agreement or association or its certificate of incorporation and a copy of its bylaws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business.

2. A list of its members.

3. The name and address of a resident of this state for service of process, notices and orders.

4. A statement of its qualifications as a rating organization.

5. A financial statement that is certified by an officer of the applicant, that is on a form acceptable to the director and that includes financial information that is current as of not more than ninety days before the date the application is filed with the director.  The financial statement shall include an income statement and a balance sheet that is prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles and that is for the two years immediately preceding the date of the financial statement.  The applicant shall not submit consolidated income statements or balance sheets.

6. A plan for the orderly and timely transfer to the designated statistical agent or the director of all data collected in accordance with the statistical plan in effect in this state from its member insurers in this state if the rating organization ceases to do business in this state.

B. If the director finds that the applicant is competent and otherwise qualified to act as a rating organization and that its constitution, articles of agreement or association or certificate of incorporation and its bylaws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business conform to the requirements of law, the director shall issue a license specifying the kinds of insurance, or subdivisions or classes of risks or parts or combinations thereof, for which the applicant is authorized to act as a rating organization. The director shall either grant or deny an application in whole or in part within sixty days after its filing.

C. Licenses issued pursuant to this section shall remain in effect until suspended or revoked by the director or the director has accepted the surrender of the license. The director may suspend or revoke a license after notice and a hearing if the rating organization ceases to meet the requirements of this section.

#### Section 20-362. Notice to director of changes in rating organization

Every rating organization shall notify the director promptly of every change in:

1. Its constitution, its articles of agreement or association, or its certificate of incorporation, and its bylaws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business.

2. Its list of members and subscribers.

3. The name and address of the resident of this state designated by it upon whom notices or orders of the director or process affecting the rating organization may be served.

#### Section 20-363. Availability of services of rating organization to members

A. Subject to rules and regulations that have been approved by the director as reasonable, each workers' compensation rating organization shall permit any insurer writing workers' compensation insurance in this state to become a member. The rating organization shall give its members notice of proposed changes in its rules and regulations.

B. Each rating organization shall furnish its rating services without discrimination to its members.

C. Any member or insurer may request that the director review the reasonableness of any rule or regulation in its application to members at a hearing held on at least ten days' written notice to the rating organization and to the member or insurer. If the director finds that the rule or regulation is unreasonable in its application, the director shall order that the rule or regulation does not apply.

D. Every insurer writing workers' compensation insurance in this state shall be a member of one workers' compensation rating organization.

E. A rating organization shall have as members at least five insurers authorized to write and who are writing workers' compensation insurance in this state and whose combined experience is determined by the director to be reasonably adequate for rate making purposes.

 

#### Section 20-364. Technical services

A. Any rating organization may provide for the examination of policies, daily reports, binders, renewal certificates, endorsements or other evidence of insurance, or the cancellation thereof, and may make reasonable rules governing their submission. Such rules shall contain a provision that in the event any insurer does not within sixty days furnish satisfactory evidence to the rating organization of the correction of any error or omission previously called to its attention by the rating organization, it shall be the duty of the rating organization to notify the director thereof. All information so submitted shall be confidential.

B. Any rating organization may subscribe for or purchase actuarial, technical or other services, and such services shall be available to all members and subscribers without discrimination.

#### Section 20-365. Cooperation in rate making

Cooperation among rating organizations and among rating organizations and insurers in rate making and in other matters within the scope of this article is authorized, if the filings resulting from such cooperation are subject to the provisions of this article. The director may review such cooperative activities and practices and if, after a hearing, he finds that any such activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this article, he may issue a written order specifying in what respects such activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent, and requiring the discontinuance of such activity or practice.

#### Section 20-366. Appeal by member or subscriber from action relating to filings

A. Any member of or subscriber to a rating organization may appeal to the director from the action or decision of the rating organization in approving or rejecting any proposed change in or addition to the filings of the rating organization, and the director shall, after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice to the applicant and to the rating organization, issue an order approving the action or decision of the rating organization or directing it to give further consideration to the proposal, or if the appeal is from the action or decision of the rating organization in rejecting a proposed addition to its filings, the director may, in the event that he shall find that such action or decision was unreasonable, issue an order directing the rating organization to make an addition to its filings, on behalf of its members and subscribers, in a manner consistent with the findings of the director, within a reasonable time after the issuance of the order.

B. In the case of insurance to which this article applies, if the appeal is based upon the failure of the rating organization to make a filing on behalf of such member or subscriber which is based on a system of expense provisions which differs from the system of expense provisions included in a filing made by the rating organization, the director shall, if he grants the appeal, order the rating organization to make the requested filing for use by the applicant. In deciding the appeal the director shall apply the standards set forth in section 20-356.

C. In the case of title insurance, if the appeal is from the action or decision of the rating organization with regard to a rate or a proposed change in or addition to its filings relating to the character and extent of coverage, the director may, in the event that he shall find that such action or decision was unreasonable, issue an order directing the rating organization to proceed in a manner consistent with his findings, within a reasonable time after the issuance of the order. The failure of a title insurance rating organization to take action or make a decision within thirty days after submission to it of a proposal under this article shall constitute a rejection of such proposal within the meaning of this section.  If such appeal is based upon the failure of the rating organization to make a filing on behalf of such members or subscriber which is based on a system of expense allocation which differs from the system of expense allocation included in a filing made by the rating organization, the director shall, if he grants the appeal, order the rating organization to make the requested filing for use by the applicant. In deciding such appeal, the director shall apply the standards set forth in section 20-375.

#### Section 20-367. Workers' compensation appeals board; composition

The director shall appoint any remaining insurer representatives needed to constitute five members as ratably as possible based on distribution of the total statewide workers' compensation net written premium for the preceding calendar year.

G. Members of the board are not eligible to receive compensation or travel expenses under title 38, chapter 4, article 2.

#### Section 20-367.01. Appeals procedure

A. Within a reasonable time after receiving a written request and on payment of a reasonable fee, every rating organization and insurer shall give to any insured affected by a rate that is made or applied by the organization or insurer, or to the insured's authorized representative, all pertinent information related to the rate.

B. If a person is aggrieved by the application of a rating system, the person may send a written request to the workers' compensation appeals board established by section 20-367 to review the manner in which the rating system has been applied to the insurance afforded the aggrieved person.  The aggrieved person or that person's representative may present the grievance before the board. A representative of the rating organization whose rating system is the subject of the appeal shall attend any hearing before the board pursuant to this section to explain that application of the rating system to the aggrieved person.

C. If the board does not act on the aggrieved person's request for review within thirty days after receiving the request, the aggrieved person may proceed as if the board had rejected the request for review.

D. The appellant shall pay the cost to record the board's proceedings.

E. The board shall mail a written notice of its decision to the aggrieved person.  Within thirty days after the date the board mails the written notice of its decision, the aggrieved person may appeal the action to the director.  After a hearing held on at least ten days' written notice to the person and the rating organization or insurer, the director shall affirm, modify or reverse the board's decision.

#### Section 20-368. Advisory organizations

A. Every group, association or other organization of insurers, whether located within or outside this state, which assists insurers which make their own filings or rating organizations in rate making, by the collection and furnishing of loss or expense statistics, or by the submission of recommendations, but which does not make filings under this article, shall be known as an advisory organization.

D. No insurer which makes its own filings nor any rating organization shall support its filings by statistics or adopt rate making recommendations furnished to it by an advisory organization which has not complied with this section or with an order of the director involving such statistics or recommendations issued under subsection C of this section. If the director finds the insurer or rating organization to be in violation of this subsection, he may issue an order requiring the discontinuance of the violation.

#### Section 20-369. Joint underwriting or joint reinsurance

A. Every group, association or other organization of insurers which engages in joint underwriting or joint reinsurance shall be subject to regulation with respect thereto as provided by this article, subject, however, with respect to joint underwriting, to all other provisions of this article, and with respect to joint reinsurance, to the provisions of sections 20-370 and 20-374.

B. If, after a hearing the director finds that any activity or practice of any such group, association or other organization is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this article, he may issue a written order specifying in what respects the activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent and requiring the discontinuance of the activity or practice.

The director, as often as he deems it expedient, may make or cause to be made an examination of each rating organization licensed in this state, each advisory organization referred to in section 20-368 and each group, association or other organization referred to in section 20-369. The reasonable costs of such examination shall be paid by the rating organization, advisory organization or group, association or other organization examined upon presentation to it of a detailed account of the cost.

B. The officers, managers, agents and employees of the rating organization, advisory organization or group, association or other organization may be examined at any time under oath, and shall exhibit all books, records, accounts, documents or agreements governing its method of operation.

C. The director shall furnish two copies of the examination report to the organization, group or association examined and shall notify the organization, group or association that, within twenty days thereafter, it may request a hearing on the report or on any facts or recommendations in the report. Before filing the report for public inspection, the director shall grant a hearing to the organization, group or association examined.

E. The director may withhold the report of the examination from public inspection for such time as the director deems proper.

F. In lieu of the examination, the director may accept the report of an examination made by the insurance supervisory official of another state, pursuant to the laws of such state.

 

#### Section 20-371. Rate administration

A. The director shall adopt reasonable rules and statistical plans that are reasonably adapted to each of the rating systems on file with the director and that may be modified from time to time.  An insurer shall use the rules and statistical plans to record and report its loss and countrywide expense experience in order that the experience of all insurers may be made available, at least annually, in sufficient form and detail to aid the director in determining whether rating systems comply with the standards set forth in this article. The rules and plans may also provide for the recording and reporting of expense experience items that are especially applicable to this state and that are not susceptible to determination by prorating of countrywide expense experience.

B. In adopting the rules and plans, the director shall give due consideration to the rating systems on file with the director, and, in order that the rules and plans may be as uniform as is practicable among the several states, to the rules and to the form of plans used for comparable rating systems in other states.

C. An insurer is not required to record or report its loss experience on a classification basis that is inconsistent with the uniform classification plan.

D. The director may designate an organization the director deems qualified, other than an insurer that has outstanding obligations under a policy of workers' compensation insurance in this state, to act as the director's statistical agent. The statistical agent shall assist the director in gathering and compiling workers' compensation experience and performing other related services as the director may specify. The compilations shall be made available subject to reasonable rules adopted by the director, to insurers and rating organizations, but no insurer shall be required to file its experience with an organization of which it is not a member.

E. Every insurer shall report its loss and expense experience to the rating organization of which it is a member.  The rating organization shall report the insurer's experience to the designated statistical agent.  If the rating organization is unable to report the experience of its member insurers to the designated statistical agent, every insurer that is a member of the rating organization shall directly report its experience to the designated statistical agent.

F. If there is more than one licensed rating organization that meets the requirements of section 20-363, subsection E, the director shall designate one of the organizations as the designated rating organization for the purpose of annually making and filing with the director statewide workers' compensation insurance rates that become effective on January 1.

G. The designated rating organization shall annually file its rate filing with the director on or before August 1 for rates that become effective on January 1.  The director shall disapprove the filing if it does not meet the standards of section 20-356, paragraph 1. An insurer transacting workers' compensation insurance in this state shall adhere to the expected loss ratios, ballast factors and other experience rating factors and to the statewide rates and other rating values made by the designated rating organization for the uniform rate filing, except that an insurer may deviate from the statewide rate portion of the uniform rate filing according to section 20-359, subsections A and B.

H. The director may allow the designated statistical agent and designated rating organization to charge licensed rating organizations that operate in this state a reasonable fee for their services. The licensed rating organizations shall pay the fees on a ratable basis.

I. To further the uniform administration of rate regulatory laws, the director and every insurer and rating organization may exchange information and experience data with insurance supervisory officials, insurers and rating organizations in other states and may consult with them with respect to rate making and the application of rating systems.

J. If more than one rating organization meets the requirements of section 20-363, subsection E, the director shall designate the statistical plan, classification plan or experience rating plan adopted by the designated rating organization or any other rating organization, or the plans of another state, as the uniform statistical plan, the uniform classification plan or the uniform experience rating plan.

K. If the director does not designate a uniform statistical plan, a uniform classification plan or a uniform experience rating plan pursuant to this section, each insurer shall adhere to the statistical plan, classification plan, and experience rating plan adopted by the rating organization of which the insurer is a member in this state.

#### Section 20-372. Disclosure of information relating to rates

No person or organization shall wilfully withhold information from, or knowingly give false or misleading information to, the director, any statistical agency designated by the director, any rating organization or any insurer, which will affect the rates or premiums chargeable under this article.

#### Section 20-373. Commissions and fees

Nothing in this article shall abridge or restrict the freedom of contract of insurers, agents or brokers with reference to the amount of commissions or fees to be paid to agents or brokers by insurers, and such payments are expressly authorized.

#### Section 20-374. Revocation and suspension of licenses

The director may suspend the license of any rating organization or the certificate of authority of any insurer which fails to comply with an order of the director made pursuant to this article within the time limited by the order, or any extension thereof which may be granted by the director. The director shall not suspend the license of any rating organization or the certificate of authority of any insurer for failure to comply with an order until the time prescribed for a review thereof has expired, or if a review has been sought, until the order has been affirmed. The director may determine when a suspension of license or certificate shall become effective, and it shall remain in effect for the period fixed by him, unless he modifies or rescinds the suspension, or until the order upon which suspension is based is modified, rescinded or reversed. No license or certificate shall be suspended or revoked except upon the written order of the director stating his findings, made after a hearing held upon not less than ten days written notice to such person or organization, specifying the alleged violation.

#### Section 20-375. Making of title insurance rates

A. Every title insurer that shall make its own rates, and every title insurance rating organization, shall make rates that are not excessive nor inadequate for the safety and soundness of any title insurer, that do not unfairly discriminate between risks in this state which involve essentially the same exposure to loss and expense elements, and that give due consideration to all of the following matters:

1. The desirability for stability of rate structures.

2. The necessity, by encouraging growth in assets of title insurers in periods of high business activity, of assuring the financial solvency of title insurers in periods of economic depression.

3. The necessity for paying dividends on the capital stock of title insurers sufficient to induce capital to be invested therein.

B. Every title insurer that shall make its own rates, and every title insurance rating organization, shall adopt basic classifications of policies or contracts of title insurance which shall be used as the basis for rates.

C. Rates within each rate classification may, at the discretion of the title insurer which files its own rates, or at the discretion of the title insurance rating organization, be less than the cost of the expense elements in the case of smaller insurance policies or contracts, and the excess may be charged against the larger insurance policies or contracts without rendering the rates unfairly discriminatory.

D. There shall be no combined rate for the issuance of title insurance policies and escrow services rendered in connection with such insurance.

#### Section 20-376. Filing of title insurance rates; approval or disapproval

A. Every title insurer shall file with the director its schedules of fees, every manual of classifications, rules and plans pertaining thereto, and every modification of any of the foregoing that it proposes to use concerning its title insurance forms and products in this state.  Every filing shall include a proposed effective date and shall indicate the character and extent of the coverage or service contemplated.

B. A title insurer may satisfy its obligations to make filings by becoming a member of, or a subscriber to, a licensed title insurance rating organization that makes filings, and by authorizing the director to accept the rating organization's filings on its behalf. The filings may, at the option of the insurer, govern all of its or certain designated agents in this state.  The insurer may also elect to permit all or certain of its agents to make rate filings directly or to subscribe to a licensed title insurance rating organization that makes filings.

C. The director shall review the filings as necessary to carry out the provisions of this article.

D. Subject to the provisions of subsection F of this section, each filing shall be on file for a period of at least thirty days before it becomes effective.  The director may, on written notice given within the thirty day waiting period to the person making the filing, extend the waiting period for up to fifteen additional days, to enable the director to complete the review of the filing.  The director may grant further extensions of the waiting period only with the consent of the person making the filing. On written application by the person making the filing, the director may authorize all or part of a filing that has been reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period or any extension of the waiting period.

E. Except in the case of rates filed under subsection F, a filing that has become effective shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this article.

F. When the director finds that any rate for a particular kind or class of risk cannot practicably be filed before it is used, or that any contract or kind of title insurance, by reason of rarity or peculiar circumstances, does not lend itself to advance determination and filing of rates, the director may permit the rate to be used without a previous filing and waiting period.

G. The director shall not have the power to regulate, or require the filing of, rates or fees for reinsurance policies, contracts or agreements, for policies, contracts or agreements of excess coinsurance or for account servicing and subdivision trust services.

 

 

#### Section 20-377. Justification for title insurance rates

A. A title insurance filing shall be accompanied by a statement of the title insurer, title insurance agent, or title insurance rating organization making the filing, setting forth the basis upon which the rate was fixed, and the manner in which fees are to be computed. Any filing may be justified by:

1. The experience or judgment of the title insurer, title insurance agent, or title insurance rating organization making the filing.

2. Its interpretation of any statistical data relied upon.

3. The experience of other title insurers, title insurance agents, or title insurance rating organizations.

4. Any other factors which the title insurer, title insurance agent, or title insurance rating organization deems relevant.

B. The statement and justification shall be open to public inspection after the rate to which they apply becomes effective.

#### Section 20-378. Disapproval of title insurance filings

A. Before issuing an order of disapproval of a title insurance filing, the director shall hold a hearing upon not less than ten days' written notice, specifying in reasonable detail the matters to be considered at such hearing. Such notice shall be sent to every title insurer, title insurance agent and title insurance rating organization which made such filing. If, after such hearing, the director finds that such filing or a part thereof does not meet the requirements of this article, he shall issue an order specifying in what respects he finds that it so fails, and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, such filing or a part thereof shall be deemed no longer effective if the filing or a part thereof has become effective under the provisions of section 20-376. A title insurer, title insurance agent or title insurance rating organization shall have the right at any time to withdraw a filing or a part thereof. Copies of every such order shall be sent to every title insurer, title insurance agent and title insurance rating organization affected. Such an order shall not affect any contract or preliminary report, commitment, binder or title insurance policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth therein.

B. Any person or organization aggrieved with respect to any filing which is in effect may make written application to the director for a hearing thereon, but the title insurer, title insurance agent or title insurance rating organization which made the filing shall not be authorized to proceed under this subsection. Such an application shall specify in reasonable detail the grounds to be relied upon by the applicant. If the director finds that the application is made in good faith, that the applicant would be so aggrieved if his grounds are established, and that such grounds otherwise justify holding such a hearing, he shall, within thirty days after receipt of such application, hold a hearing upon not less than ten days' written notice to the applicant and to every title insurer, title insurance agent and title insurance rating organization which made such a filing. If, after such hearing, the director finds that the filing or a part thereof does not meet the requirements of this article, he shall issue an order specifying in what respects he finds that such filing or a part thereof fails to meet the requirements of this article and stating when within a reasonable period thereafter such filing or a part thereof shall be deemed no longer effective. Copies of such an order shall be sent to the applicant and to every such title insurer, title insurance agent and title insurance rating organization that made the filing. Such an order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth therein.

C. No filing nor any modification thereof shall be disapproved if the rates in connection therewith meet the requirements of this article.

#### Section 20-379. Deviations in title insurance rates

A. No title insurer or title insurance agent may deviate from its rates that are in effect for the title insurer or title insurance agent pursuant to section 20-376.

B. If the director finds that a title insurer or title insurance agent has charged rates that deviate from its rates filed pursuant to section 20-376, the title insurer or title insurance agent who computed and initially collected the deviation is subject to a civil penalty for each deviation that is equal to the difference between the rate charged and the allowable rate pursuant to section 20-376. To the extent that the deviation results in an overcharge, the director in lieu of a civil penalty may require a refund of the overcharge.

C. If after a hearing the director finds that a title insurer or title insurance agent with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice violated the provisions of this section and section 20-376 with respect to a particular provision of the applicable title insurance rate, the director, in addition to the civil penalty imposed under subsection B of this section, may:

1. For each violation, impose an additional civil penalty of not more than two times the civil penalty imposed under subsection B of this section.

2. Order the title insurance agent to cease and desist from the act or practice.

3. Revoke the title insurance agent's license or suspend the title insurer's certificate of authority.

D. The civil penalties that are imposed under subsections B and C of this section may not in the aggregate exceed fifteen thousand dollars during any one year period for an individual title insurer or title insurance agent licensed pursuant to this title.

#### Section 20-382. Scope of application

A. This article applies to all insurance on risks or on operations in this state, except:

1. Reinsurance, other than joint reinsurance to the extent stated in section 20-391.

2. Any policy of insurance against loss or damage to or legal liability in connection with property located outside this state, any motor vehicle or aircraft principally garaged and used outside this state or any activity wholly carried on outside this state.

3. Insurance of vessels or craft, their cargoes, marine builders' risks, marine protection and indemnity or other risks commonly insured under marine, as distinguished from inland marine, insurance policies.

4. Disability or life insurance.

5. Annuities.

6. Workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance written in connection with workers' compensation.

7. Title insurance.

8. Rates developed by an insurer to be applied individually to the insurance policies of risks, other than medical malpractice risks and industrial insured risks pursuant to section 20-400.10, for which no rate service organization has published a rate or loss costs in this or any other state and for which insufficient similar exposure units and loss experience data exist to develop statistically credible rates for the risk and no homogeneous rating class exists in which the risk could reasonably be placed. With respect to each type of risk covered by this subsection, the insurer shall annually certify by January 30 to the director for the preceding calendar year, on a form acceptable to the director, that the insurer did not have when the risks were written credible experience to establish a rating class for the specific types of risks.  The insurer or rate service organization on the insurer's behalf shall file a rate for the specific risks with the director pursuant to section 20-385 when either of the following occurs:

(a) The insurer's written premiums for any specific risk covered by this subsection exceed twenty-five per cent of the insurer's total annual written premium in this state and the insurer has issued contracts for five or more homogeneous risks covered by this subsection in this state in any consecutive three year period, unless an insurer demonstrates to the director that its experience under this subsection does not produce sufficient data to satisfy the requirements of subdivision (b) of this paragraph.

(b) The number of specific risks covered by this subsection and written by the insurer in a specific class meet the standards set forth in the actuarial standard of practice 25 applying to credibility for rate making purposes as adopted by the actuarial standards board as of January 1, 1997.

B. This article does not apply to hospital service or medical service corporations, investment companies, mutual benefit associations or fraternal beneficiary associations.

#### Section 20-383. Rate standards

A. An insurer shall not charge rates that are excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. An insurer shall not charge any rate which if continued will have or tend to have the effect of destroying competition or establishing a monopoly.

B. Rates are excessive if they are likely to produce an underwriting profit that is unreasonably high for the class of business or if expenses are unreasonably high in relation to established services rendered. Rates are presumed not to be excessive if a reasonable degree of price competition exists at the consumer level with respect to a particular class of business. A competitive market is presumed to exist unless the director, after a hearing, determines that a reasonable degree of price competition does not exist in the market and issues an order pursuant to section 20-388 to that effect. The order expires no later than one year after its effective date unless the director finds, after a hearing, that there is a continuing lack of reasonable competition in the market. If the director finds, after a hearing, that a reasonable degree of price competition among insurers writing a particular line, subline or class of business does not exist, he may prescribe an allowable percentage of increase in a proposed rate level for such line, subline or class of business. Any insurer making a rate filing exceeding the allowable percentage of increase shall, prior to the effective date of such proposed rate increase, provide the director with sufficient actuarial data to support such increase. The director's order establishing allowable percentages of increase for a particular line, subline or class of business shall expire no later than one year after its effective date. In determining whether a reasonable degree of price competition exists, the director shall consider relevant tests of competition pertaining to market structure, market performance and market conduct, including:

1. The number of insurers actively engaged in the class of business.

2. The market share and changes in market share of insurers.

3. The existence of a degree of rate differentials in a particular class of business.

4. The ease of entry and latent competition of insurers capable of easy entry.

C. Rates are inadequate if they are clearly insufficient to sustain projected losses and expenses in the class of business to which they apply.

D. A rate is not unfairly discriminatory in relation to another in the same class if it reflects equitably the differences in expected losses and expenses. Rates are not unfairly discriminatory because different premiums result for policyholders with like loss exposures but different expense factors, or like expense factors but different loss exposures, if the rates reflect the differences with reasonable accuracy. Rates are not unfairly discriminatory if they are averaged broadly among persons insured under a group, franchise or blanket policy.

#### Section 20-384. Rating criteria

A. In setting rates, an insurer shall apply the criteria prescribed in this section.

B. An insurer shall give due consideration to past and prospective loss and expense experience within and outside this state, to catastrophe hazards, to a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, to investment income from unearned premium and loss reserves, to trends within and outside this state, to reasonable dividends or savings to be allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers and to all other factors, including judgment factors.

C. Risks may be classified in any reasonable way for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classifications shall not be based on race, color, creed or national origin. Rates produced may be modified for individual risks in accordance with rating plans or schedules that establish reasonable standards for measuring probable variations in hazards or expenses, or both.

D. The expense provisions included in the rates to be used by an insurer may reflect the operating methods of the insurer and its own expense experience.

E. Rates and supplementary rate information established pursuant to this article shall not be based on or include loss and expense experience attributable to insurance coverage issued to an industrial insured pursuant to section 20-400.10.

 

#### Section 20-385. Filing of rates

A. Except as to marine, inland marine and transportation risks, which by general custom of the business are not written according to manual rates and rating plans, and except as provided in subsection F of this section or section 20-400.10, every authorized insurer and every rate service organization which has been designated by any insurer for the filing of rates pursuant to section 20-387, subsection B shall file with the director all rates and supplementary rate information and all changes and amendments to those rates made by it for use in this state within thirty days after they become effective. If a rate service organization files prospective loss costs on behalf of its member insurers with the director, each member insurer that adopts the rate service organization's prospective loss costs shall file, on a form approved by the director, the loss cost adjustment and loss cost modification factors applicable to the prospective loss costs filed by the rate service organization.  Each member insurer that does not adopt or that delays adoption of the loss costs filed by the rate service organization shall notify the director of that decision, in a form acceptable to the director, within thirty days after the effective date of the prospective loss costs.

B. For any filing made pursuant to subsection A of this section, the director may require the filing of supporting data including:

1. The experience and judgment of the filer.

2. The experience and judgment of other insurers or rate service organizations.

3. The filer's interpretation of any statistical data relied upon.

4. A description of the methods used in making the rates.

5. A description of the methods used and statistics relied on by the insurer in developing its loss cost modification factor and providing its loss cost adjustment.

6. A description of the methods used and statistics relied on by the rate service organization in developing its prospective loss costs filing.

C. An insurer is not required to file with the director the insurer’s final rate pages that combine the prospective loss costs separately filed by the rate service organization with the loss cost modification factor filed by the insurer.

D. For the purposes of this section, an insurer does not need to file with the director the insurer's final rate pages that combine the prospective loss costs with the loss cost adjustments.

E. On written consent of the insured stating the insured's reasons, the insurer may use a rate in excess of that provided by an otherwise applicable filing on a specific risk, if that rate is filed with the director pursuant to subsection A of this section.

F. For as long as the director deems proper, the director by order may exempt from the requirements of this section any insurance rate, rating class, rating rule or rating program or type the filing of which in the director's opinion is not desirable or necessary for the protection of the public.

G. If, after a hearing, the director finds that a particular market is noncompetitive, the director shall order that all rates or rate changes and all supplementary rate information in the noncompetitive market be filed with the director at least thirty days before the effective date. The order remains in effect until the director determines that a competitive market has been restored.

#### Section 20-386. Filings open to inspection

The director shall open to public inspection at any reasonable time each filing and supporting information filed pursuant to this article except information in a filing or supporting information that is a trade secret under title 44, chapter 4, article 1.  The insurer or filer shall have the burden of asserting to the director that the information is a trade secret. A person may obtain copies of materials open to public inspection upon request and payment of a reasonable charge.

 

#### Section 20-387. Delegation of rate making and rate filing obligations

A. An insurer may establish rates and supplementary rate information based on the factors in section 20-384 using, if desired, the recommendations of an advisory organization, or rates and supplementary rate information prepared by a rate service organization, with average expense factors determined by the rate service organization or with such modification for its own expense and loss experience as the credibility of that experience allows.

B. An insurer may discharge its obligations pursuant to section 20-385 by giving notice to the director that it uses rates and supplementary rate information prepared by a designated rate service organization, with such information about modifications of the rates as is necessary to inform the director. The insurer's rates and supplementary rate information are those filed by the rate service organization, including any amendments to the rate as filed, subject to the modifications filed by the insurer.

C. Licensed rate service organizations, advisory organizations and admitted insurers are authorized to exchange information and experience data with rate service organizations, advisory organizations and insurers in this and other states and may consult with them with respect to rate making.

#### Section 20-388. Disapproval of rates

If the director finds that a rate is not in compliance with section 20-383, the director shall issue an order specifying in what respects it so fails and stating that, within thirty days after the order is issued, the rate is no longer effective.  The order does not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the effective date of the order. The order shall be served immediately pursuant to section 20-151.  Any insurer, rate service organization or advisory organization may request a hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10, and the request for a hearing stays the effectiveness of the order as provided in section 20-162.

 

#### Section 20-389. Rate service organizations; license; application

A. A rate service organization shall not provide any service relating to the rates of any insurance subject to this article nor may any insurer utilize the service of such organization for such purposes unless the organization has obtained a license from the director.

B. No rate service organization may refuse to supply any services for which it is licensed in this state to any insurer authorized to do business in this state and offering to pay the fair and usual compensation for the services.

C. A rate service organization applying for a license shall include with its application:

1. A copy of its constitution, charter, articles of organization, agreement, association or incorporation and a copy of its bylaws and any other rules or regulations governing its activities.

2. A list of its members and subscribers.

3. The name and address of one or more residents of this state upon whom notices, process affecting it or orders of the director may be served.

4. A statement showing its technical qualifications for acting in the capacity for which it seeks a license.

5. Any other relevant information or documents the director may require.

D. If the director finds that the applicant and the natural persons through whom it acts are qualified to provide the services proposed and that all requirements of law are met, the director shall issue a license specifying the authorized activity of the applicant. The director shall not issue a license if the proposed activity would tend to establish a monopoly or to lessen or to destroy price competition. Licenses issued pursuant to this section remain in effect until the licensee withdraws from this state or until the license is suspended or revoked.

E. A rate service organization shall promptly file any amendment to a document required to be filed pursuant to this section. Failure to file any such amendment is a ground for suspension of the license during the period of noncompliance. Repeated failures to file such amendments are grounds for revocation of the license.

F. Pending its application to the director for a license to provide services as a rate service organization, every rating organization providing services in this state on the effective date of this section may continue to provide services after that date as a rate service organization subject to the provisions of this article. A rate service organization shall apply for a license within thirty days after the effective date of this article.

#### Section 20-392. Rate agreements among insurers prohibited

A. Except with respect to apportionment agreements among insurers approved by the director pursuant to section 20-395, an insurer shall not assume any obligation to any person, other than a policyholder or other insurers which, with it, are under common control or management or are members of a joint underwriting or joint reinsurance organization, to use or adhere to certain rates or rules. No person other than the director may impose any penalty or other adverse consequence for failure of an insurer to adhere to certain rates or rules.

B. Members and subscribers of rate service organizations or advisory organizations may use the work products and services of such organizations as their individual judgment may dictate. Such use by two or more authorized insurers shall not be sufficient to support a finding that an agreement to adhere exists and may be used only for the purpose of supplementing direct evidence of such an agreement.

#### Section 20-393. Recording and reporting of experience

The director shall promulgate reasonable rules, including rules providing statistical plans, for use by all insurers in the recording and reporting of loss and expense experience, in order that the experience of such insurers may be made available to the director.

The director may determine when a suspension of a license becomes effective and it shall remain in effect for the period fixed by the director, unless the director modifies or rescinds such suspension, or until the order upon which such suspension is based is modified, rescinded or reversed.

D. The director shall not impose a penalty or suspend or revoke a license except upon a written order stating the director's findings, made after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice to such person or organization specifying the alleged violation.

C. Any property insurance policy containing wildfire protection services, including wildfire mitigation and wildfire suppression services conducted by a private entity, that is issued for delivery to an insured in this state shall contain a conspicuously stamped or written notice in bold-faced type that states that the wildfire protection services are not subject to review by the department.

#### Section 20-399. Payment of dividends

This article does not prohibit or regulate the payment of dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers.

On the request of the director, each insurer authorized to write any insurance in this state to which this article applies shall submit data to the director establishing the relationship of the aggregate premiums actually charged policyholders by the insurer for each line of insurance to the premiums produced by the insurer's filed unmodified rates for each line of insurance. A rate service organization may file the data on behalf of the insurer. Any insurer whose data indicates that the aggregate premiums actually charged policyholders for each line of insurance exceed the premiums produced by its filed unmodified rates by more than a percentage established by the director by rule, or fall below the premiums produced by its filed unmodified rates by more than a percentage established and published by the director by rule, shall be examined by the director to determine whether the rating plan or filed unmodified rates comply with sections 20-356 and 20-357 or 20-384 and 20-385.

2. Suspend the insurer's authority to do business in any given class.

3. Require applicable refunds to policyholders.

#### Section 20-400.04. Examinations

B. No person that is not an insurer shall assume or use any name which deceptively infers or suggests that it is an insurer.

#### Section 20-445. Defamation

No person shall make, publish, disseminate or circulate, directly or indirectly, or aid, abet or encourage the making, publishing, disseminating or circulating of any oral or written statement or any pamphlet, circular, article, sales material or literature which is false or maliciously critical of or derogatory to the financial condition of an insurer, and which is calculated to injure any person engaged in the business of insurance, or any domestic corporation or group being formed pursuant to this code for the purpose of becoming an insurer. This provision shall not be deemed to restrict the right, lawfully exercised, of newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, and similar public media for news dissemination, objectively to publish and disseminate news.

#### Section 20-446. Acts tending to result in unreasonable restraint or monopoly of insurance business

No person shall enter into any agreement to commit, or by any concerted action commit, any act of boycott, coercion or intimidation resulting in or tending to result in unreasonable restraint of, or monopoly in, the business of insurance.

No person shall file with any public official, or make, publish, disseminate, circulate or deliver to any person, or place before the public, or cause, directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated or delivered to any person, or placed before the public, any false statement of the financial condition of an insurer with intent to deceive.

B. No person shall make any false entry in any book, report or statement of any insurer or other person required to have records under this title, with intent to deceive any agent or examiner lawfully appointed to examine into its condition or into any of its affairs, or any public official to whom the insurer or person is required by law to report, or who has authority by law to examine into its condition or into any of its affairs, or, with like intent, wilfully omit to make a true entry of any material fact pertaining to the business of the insurer or person in any book, report or statement thereof.

#### Section 20-448. Unfair discrimination; definitions

A. A person shall not make or permit any unfair discrimination between individuals of the same class and equal expectation of life in the rates charged for any contract of life insurance or of life annuity or in the dividends or other benefits payable or in any other of the terms and conditions of the contract.

B. A person shall not make or permit any unfair discrimination respecting hemophiliacs or between individuals of the same class and of essentially the same hazard in the amount of premium, policy fees or rates charged for any policy or contract of disability insurance or in the benefits payable or in any of the terms or conditions of the contract, or in any other manner whatever. The provisions of this subsection regarding hemophiliacs do not apply to any policy or subscription contract that provides only benefits for specific diseases or for accidental injuries or that provides only indemnity for blood transfusion services or replacement of whole blood products, fractions or derivatives.

C. As to kinds of insurance other than life and disability, a person shall not make or permit any unfair discrimination in favor of particular persons or between insureds or subjects of insurance having substantially like insuring, risk and exposure factors, or expense elements, in the terms or conditions of any insurance contract, or in the rate or amount of premium charged.

D. An insurer shall not refuse to consider an application for life or disability insurance on the basis of a genetic condition, developmental delay or developmental disability.

E. The rejection of an application or the determining of rates, terms or conditions of a life or disability insurance contract on the basis of a genetic condition, developmental delay or developmental disability constitutes unfair discrimination, unless the applicant's medical condition and history and either claims experience or actuarial projections establish that substantial differences in claims are likely to result from the genetic condition, developmental delay or developmental disability.

F. In addition to the provisions in subsection E of this section, the rejection of an application or the determination of rates, terms or conditions of a disability insurance contract on the basis of a genetic condition constitutes unfair discrimination in the absence of a diagnosis of the condition related to information obtained as a result of a genetic test.

G. An insurer that offers life, disability or long-term care insurance contracts may not unfairly discriminate against a living organ donor in the offering, issuance, price or conditions of an insurance policy based solely, and without additional actuarial risks, on that person's status as a living organ donor.

H. An insurer that offers life, disability, property or liability insurance contracts shall not deny a claim incurred or deny, refuse, refuse to renew, restrict, cancel, exclude or limit coverage or charge a different rate for the same coverage solely on the basis that the insured or proposed insured is or has been a victim of domestic violence or is an entity or individual that provides counseling, shelter, protection or other services to victims of domestic violence. If an insurer that offers life, disability, property or liability insurance contracts denies a claim incurred or denies, refuses, refuses to renew, restricts, cancels, excludes or limits coverage or charges a different rate for the same coverage on the basis of a mental or physical condition and the insured or the proposed insured is or has been a victim of domestic violence, the insurer shall submit a written explanation to the insured or proposed insured of the reasons for the insurer's actions, in accordance with section 20-2110. The fact that an insured or proposed insured is or has been the victim of domestic violence is not a mental or physical condition. This subsection is not intended to provide any private right or cause of action to or on behalf of any applicant or insured. It is the specific intent of this subsection to provide solely an administrative remedy to the director for any violation of this section. This subsection does not prevent an insurer from refusing to issue a life insurance policy insuring a person who has been the victim of domestic violence if either of the following is true:

1. The family or household member who commits the act of domestic violence is the applicant for or prospective owner of the policy or would be the beneficiary of the policy and any of the following is true:

(a) The applicant or prospective beneficiary of the policy is known, on the basis of police or court records, to have committed an act of domestic violence.

(b) The insurer has knowledge of an arrest or conviction for a domestic violence related offense by the family or household member.

(c) The insurance company has other reasonable grounds to believe, and those grounds are corroborated, that the applicant or proposed beneficiary of a policy is a family or household member committing acts of domestic violence.

2. The applicant or prospective owner of the policy lacks an insurable interest in the insured.

I. Subsection H of this section does not prevent an insurer that:

1. Offers life or disability insurance contracts from underwriting coverage on the basis of an insured's or proposed insured's mental or physical condition if the underwriting:

(a) Does not consider whether or not the mental or physical condition was caused by an act of domestic violence.

(b) Is the same for an insured or proposed insured who is not the victim of domestic violence as it is for an insured or proposed insured who is the victim of domestic violence.

(c) Does not violate any other rule or law.

2. Offers property or liability insurance contracts from underwriting coverage on the basis of the insured's claims history or characteristics of the insured's property and using rating criteria consistent with section 20-384.

J. Any determination made pursuant to section 20-2537 by the external independent review organization shall not be considered in connection with the evaluation of whether any person subject to this article has complied with this section.

K. A property or liability insurer may exclude coverage for losses caused by an insured's intentional or fraudulent act.  The exclusion shall not deny an insured's otherwise covered property loss if the property loss is caused by an act of domestic violence by another insured under the policy and the insured who claims the property loss cooperates in any investigation relating to the loss and did not cooperate in or contribute to the creation of the property loss.  The insurer may apply reasonable standards of proof for claims filed under this subsection.  The insurer may limit the payment to the insured's insurable interest in the property minus any payment made to any mortgagee or other party with a secured interest in the property. This subsection does not require an insurer to pay any amount that is more than the amount of the loss or property coverage limits. An insurer who pays a claim under this subsection has the right of subrogation against any person except the victim of the domestic violence.

L. All insurers shall adopt and adhere to written policies that are consistent with chapter 11 of this title and that specify the procedures to be followed by employees, contractors, producers, agents and brokers to ensure the privacy of and to help protect the safety of a victim of domestic violence when taking an application, investigating a claim, pursuing subrogation or taking any other action relating to a policy or claim involving a victim of domestic violence.  Insurers shall distribute the written policies to employees, contractors, producers, agents and brokers who have access to personal or privileged information regarding domestic violence.

A. Any domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one or more persons, may organize or acquire one or more subsidiaries subject to the limitations of this article. Such subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business or businesses and the authority to do so shall not be limited by reason of the fact that such subsidiaries are subsidiaries of a domestic insurer.

B. In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities permitted under all other sections of this title, a domestic insurer, pursuant to subsection A of this section, may:

1. Invest in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one or more subsidiaries in amounts that do not exceed the lesser of ten per cent of such insurer's assets or fifty per cent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, provided that after such investments the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. In calculating the amount of such investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries and health care service organizations shall be excluded, and there shall be included total net monies or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of such subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities, and all amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus, of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation.

2. Invest any amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one or more subsidiaries that is engaged or organized to engage exclusively in the ownership and management of assets authorized as investments for the insurer if each subsidiary agrees to limit its investments in any asset so that such investments will not cause the amount of the total investment of the insurer to exceed any of the investment limitations specified in paragraph 1 of this subsection or in chapter 3, article 2 of this title, applicable to the insurer. For the purpose of this paragraph, "the total investment of the insurer" includes any direct investment by the insurer in an asset and the insurer's proportionate share of the investment in an asset by any subsidiary of the insurer, which shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of the subsidiary's investment by the percentage of the insurer's ownership of such subsidiary.

3. With the approval of the director, invest any greater amount in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of one or more subsidiaries, provided that after such investment the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs.

C. Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of subsidiaries made pursuant to subsection B of this section are not subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in this title applicable to such investment of insurers.

D. Whether any investment pursuant to subsection B of this section meets the applicable requirements is to be determined before the investment is made by calculating the applicable investment limitations as if the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the date they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.

E. If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment in the subsidiary made pursuant to this section within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further times as the director may prescribe, unless at any time after such investment has been made, such investment has met the requirements for investment under any other section of this title, and the insurer has so notified the director.

F. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors shall be considered:

3. The extent to which the insurer's business is diversified among the several lines of insurance.

E. Each registered insurer shall be liable for and shall pay the expenses of such examination in accordance with section 20-159.

The director may then publish all or any part of the documents, materials or other information as the director deems appropriate.

B. The director may:

1. Share nonpublic documents, materials or other information with other state, federal and international regulatory agencies, with the national association of insurance commissioners and its affiliates and subsidiaries and with state, federal and international law enforcement authorities, including members of any supervisory college described in section 20-481.31, if the recipient agrees and warrants that it has the authority to maintain the confidentiality and privileged status of the documents, materials or other information and has verified in writing the legal authority to maintain confidentiality.

D. Notwithstanding subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section, the director may share confidential and privileged documents, material or information reported pursuant to section 20-481.10, subsection D only with the directors or commissioners of insurance of other states having statutes or regulations substantially similar to subsection A of this section and who have agreed in writing not to disclose such information. The sharing of information by the director pursuant to this article does not constitute a delegation of regulatory authority by the director and the director is solely responsible for the administration, execution and enforcement of this article.

#### Section 20-481.25. Acquisitions involving insurers not otherwise covered; anticompetitive considerations; civil penalty; definitions

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state.

B. This section does not apply to the following, except as provided under subsections C and D of this section:

1. A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes as long as the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in this state. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control as defined in section 20-481, the purchase of securities is not solely for investment purposes unless the insurance director of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary insurance director to the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions of this state.

2. The acquisition of a person by another person if both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance and if preacquisition notification is filed with the director pursuant to subsection C of this section thirty days before the proposed effective date of the acquisition. Preacquisition notification is not required if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by any other provision of this subsection.

3. The acquisition of already affiliated persons.

4. If, as an immediate result of an acquisition, the combined market share of the involved insurers in any market would not exceed five percent of the total market, there would not be an increase in any market share or the combined market share of the involved insurers in any market would not exceed twelve percent of the total market and the market share increases by more than two percent of the total market. For the purposes of this paragraph, "market" means direct written insurance premiums in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state.

5. An acquisition for which a preacquisition notification is required pursuant to this section because of the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business.

6. An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary insurance director finds that the insurer is failing, that there is no feasible alternative to improve the insurer's condition and that the public benefits that would result from improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would result from not lessening competition and the domiciliary insurance director communicates these findings to the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions of this state.

C. An acquisition under subsection B of this section may be subject to an order pursuant to subsection F of this section unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a preacquisition notification.  Information submitted under this subsection is confidential. The preacquisition notification shall be in a form and contain the information that is prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners relating to those markets that are not exempt from the provisions of this section.  The director may require additional material and information that the director deems necessary in order to determine if the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. The information may include an economist's opinion on the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state and a summary of the economist's education and experience that indicates the economist's ability to render an informed opinion. The waiting period begins on the date the director receives a preacquisition notification and ends thirty days after the date of receipt or on termination of the waiting period by the director, whichever is earlier. Before the waiting period ends, the director on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional information that is relevant to the proposed acquisition. The waiting period shall end thirty days after the director receives the additional information or terminates the waiting period, whichever is earlier.

D. An acquisition subject to the provisions of this section shall not substantially lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly. The director may enter a cease and desist order under subsection F of this section if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly or if the insurer fails to file adequate information pursuant to subsection C of this section. The director has the burden of showing prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection. In determining if a proposed acquisition would lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly, the director shall consider the following:

1. An acquisition covered under subsection B of this section that involves two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection if:

(a) The market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following market shares:

Insurer A   Insurer B

(i) four percent four percent or more

(ii) ten percent two percent or more

(iii) fifteen percent  one percent or more

(b) The market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following market shares:

Insurer A   Insurer B

(i) five percent five percent or more

(ii) ten percent four percent or more

(iii) fifteen percent  three percent or more

(iv) nineteen percent  one percent or more

A highly concentrated market is a market in which the share of the four largest insurers is seventy-five percent or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection. For the purposes of this paragraph, the insurer with the largest market share is deemed to be insurer A.

2. A significant trend toward increased concentration exists if the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the eight largest, has increased by seven percent or more of the market over a period of time that extends from a base year five to ten years before the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. Any acquisition or merger under subsection B of this section that involves two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection if:

(a) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market.

(b) One of the insurers involved is one of the insurers in a grouping of large insurers whose market share has increased by seven percent or more.

(c) Another involved insurer's market is two percent or more.

E. If an acquisition is not prima facie evidence of a violation of subsection D of this section, the director may establish the requisite anticompetitive effect based on other substantial evidence. If an acquisition is prima facie evidence of a violation of subsection D of this section, a party may establish the absence of the requisite anticompetitive effect based on other substantial evidence. Relevant factors in making a determination under this subsection include market shares, volatility of ranking of market leaders, number of competitors, concentration, trend of concentration in the industry and ease of entry into and exit from the market.

F. If an acquisition violates this section, the director may enter an order:

1. Requiring an involved insurer to cease and desist from doing business in this state with respect to the line or lines of insurance involved in the violation.

2. Denying the application of an acquired or acquiring insurer for a license to do business in this state.

G. The director shall not enter an order pursuant to subsection F of this section unless a hearing is held and notice of the hearing is issued before the end of the waiting period prescribed in subsection C of this section and not less than fifteen days before the hearing. The hearing shall be concluded and the order shall be issued not later than sixty days after the end of the waiting period. The director shall include with each order a written decision setting forth the director's findings of fact and conclusions of law. The order does not become final earlier than thirty days after it is issued. Before the order becomes final the involved insurer may submit a plan to remedy within a reasonable time the anticompetitive impact of the acquisition. Based on the submitted plan or other information, the director shall specify the conditions, if any, that would remedy the aspects of the acquisition causing the violation and shall vacate or modify the order. An order does not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.

H. An order shall not be entered under subsection F of this section if:

1. The acquisition will yield substantial economies of scale or economies in resource utilization that cannot be achieved feasibly in any other way and the public benefits that would arise from the economies exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition.

2. The acquisition will increase substantially the availability of insurance and the public benefits of the increase exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition.

I. The director, after notice and a hearing, may impose one or more of the following civil penalties against a person who violates a cease and desist order that is in effect:

1. Up to and including $10,000 for every day of violation.

2. Suspension or revocation of the person's license.

J. An insurer or other person who fails to make a filing required by this section and who fails to demonstrate a good faith effort to comply with the filing requirement is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $50,000.

K. For the purposes of subsection D of this section:

1. "Insurer" means a company or group of companies under common management, ownership or control.

2. "Market" means the relevant product and geographical markets.  In determining the relevant product and geographical markets, the director shall consider the definitions or guidelines adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners and information submitted by the parties to the acquisition. In the absence of sufficient information to the contrary, the relevant product market is assumed to be the direct written insurance premium for a line of business that is used in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers doing business in this state.  The relevant geographical market is this state.

L. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Acquisition" means any agreement, arrangement or activity that results in a person acquiring directly or indirectly the control of another person, including the acquisition of voting securities, assets, bulk reinsurance and mergers.

2. "Involved insurer" means an insurer that acquires or is acquired, is affiliated with an acquirer or acquired or is the result of a merger.

The director shall deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, the penalties collected in the state general fund.

B. Every director or officer of an insurance holding company system who knowingly violates, participates in, assents to or permits an officer or agent of the insurer to engage in transactions or make investments that have not been properly reported or submitted pursuant to section 20-481.02, 20-481.05 or 20-481.09 or who violates this article in his individual capacity after notice and a hearing shall pay a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars for each violation. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the director shall consider the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations and other matters as justice may require.

C. If it appears to the director that an insurer subject to this article or a director, officer, employee or agent of the insurer has engaged in a transaction or entered into a contract that is subject to this article and that would not have been approved had such approval been requested, the director may order the insurer to cease and desist immediately any further activity under that transaction or contract.

No insurance holding company system shall pay a fine on behalf of an officer, director or employee found guilty under this subsection.

F. Whenever it appears to the director that any person has committed a violation of section 20-481.02 and that violation prevents a full understanding by the director of the enterprise risk to the insurer by affiliates or by the insurance holding company system, the violation may serve as an independent basis for disapproving dividends or distributions and for placing the insurer under an order of supervision in accordance section 20-169.

 

#### Section 20-481.27. Recovery; liability

A. If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under that order has a right to recover on behalf of the insurer from any parent corporation, holding company or person or affiliate that otherwise controlled the insurer the amount of distributions, other than distributions of shares of the same class of stock, paid by the insurer on its capital stock or to recover any payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement or extraordinary lump sum salary adjustment made by the insurer or its subsidiary to a director, officer or employee if the distribution or payment is made at any time during the year preceding the petition for liquidation, conservation or rehabilitation, subject to the limitations of subsections B, C and D.

B. No distribution is recoverable if the parent or affiliate shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.

C. A person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of the distributions or payments the person received. A person who otherwise controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared is liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they are jointly and severally liable.

D. The maximum amount recoverable under this section is the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds.

E. To the extent that a person liable under subsection C is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay claims due from it, its parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled it at the time the distribution was paid is jointly and severally liable for a resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it.

#### Section 20-481.28. Insurer's license; revocation; suspension; nonrenewal

If it appears to the director that a person has committed a violation of this article which makes the continued operation of an insurer contrary to the interests of policyholders or the public, the director, after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard, may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew the insurer's license or authority to do business in this state for a period he finds is required for the protection of policyholders or the public. The director shall accompany this determination by specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.

A. If it appears to the director that an insurer or a director, officer, employee or agent has committed or is about to commit a violation of this article or of a rule adopted or order issued by the director, the director may apply to the superior court in the county in which the principal office of the insurer is located for an injunction and for other equitable relief as the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public may require. If the insurer has no office in this state, the director may apply to the superior court in Maricopa county.

B. No security that is the subject of any agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition or that is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of the provisions of this article or of any rule adopted or order issued by the director may be voted at any shareholder's meeting or may be counted for quorum purposes. Any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though these securities were not issued and outstanding. No action taken at any meeting may be invalidated by the voting of these securities unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this state have so ordered. If an insurer or the director has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of the provisions of this article or of any rule adopted or order issued by the director, the insurer or the director may apply to the superior court in the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business to enjoin any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition made in violation of this article or any rule adopted or order issued by the director to enjoin the voting of any security so acquired, to void any vote of the security already cast at any meeting of shareholders and for other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public requires.

C. In any case in which a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire any voting securities in violation of this article or any rule adopted or order issued by the director, the superior court in Maricopa county or the superior court in the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business, on notice as the court deems appropriate and on the application of the insurer or the director, may seize or sequester voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by that person and issue an order as is appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this article.

D. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, for the purposes of this section the situs of the ownership of the securities of domestic insurers is deemed to be in this state.

The court shall conduct its review without a jury and by trial de novo, except that if all parties, including the director, so stipulate, the review shall be confined to the record. Portions of the record may be introduced by stipulation into evidence in a trial de novo as to those parties so stipulating.

B. The filing of an appeal pursuant to this section shall stay the application of any such rule, regulation, order or other action of the director to the appealing party unless the court, after giving such party notice and an opportunity to be heard, determines that such a stay would be detrimental to the interest of policyholders, shareholders, creditors or the public.

C. Any person aggrieved by any failure of the director to act or make a determination required by this article may institute proceedings for a special action in the superior court in Maricopa county directing the director to act or make such determination.

6. Other group-wide supervision activities, consistent with the authorities and purposes enumerated in this subsection, as considered necessary by the director.

#### Section 20-482.05. Status of mutual holding company as corporation; status of insurer; rights and obligations of members; voting; articles of incorporation

C. The members of a mutual holding company have the rights and obligations set forth in this section and in the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the mutual holding company. A member of a mutual holding company may not transfer membership in the mutual holding company or any right arising from such membership.  Such limitation on the transfer of membership or rights arising from membership does not restrict the assignment of a policy that is otherwise permissible. A member of a mutual holding company is not personally liable for the acts, debts, liabilities or obligations of the mutual holding company merely by reason of being a member. An assessment of any kind may not be imposed on a member of a mutual holding company. Any premium due under an insurance policy or contract issued to a member of a mutual holding company is not considered an assessment.

D. A membership interest in a mutual holding company does not constitute a security as defined in section 44-1801.

E. Each member of a mutual holding company is entitled to one vote on each matter coming before a meeting of the members and for each director to be elected regardless of the number of policies or amount of insurance and benefits held by such member. The mutual holding company's bylaws shall set forth the voting rights of the members of a mutual holding company.

F. Meetings of the members of a mutual holding company shall be governed in the same manner as if the mutual holding company were a domestic mutual insurer, including provisions governing quorum requirements, the approval of matters by the members and the election of directors by the members.

G. The articles of incorporation of a mutual holding company shall contain all the following provisions:

1. The name of the mutual holding company. The name shall include the words "mutual holding company" or "mutual insurance holding company" or other words connoting the mutual character of the mutual holding company that are approved by the director.

2. A provision specifying that the mutual holding company is not authorized to issue capital stock, whether voting or nonvoting.

3. A provision setting forth any rights of the members of the mutual holding company on dissolution or liquidation.

H.

#### Section 20-482.06. Concurrent reorganization with a domestic or foreign mutual insurer

The concurrent reorganization of a domestic mutual insurer with one or more mutual insurers, domestic or foreign, into a single mutual insurance holding company, whether domestic or foreign, may be accomplished by a joint application and a joint plan of reorganization and may be approved by the director by complying with the requirements of this article. The director may determine that such other procedures are unnecessary to avoid duplicative costs and efforts in satisfying the requirements of this article and effectuating the reorganization.

 

#### Section 20-482.07. Foreign mutual insurer reorganization; definition

A. A foreign mutual insurer organized under the laws of any other state, that, if a domestic corporation, would be organized under section 20-709, may reorganize by merging its policyholders' membership interests into an existing domestic mutual holding company in accordance with the requirements of any other law or regulation that applies to the foreign mutual insurer. The reorganization shall continue the corporate existence of the converting mutual insurer as a foreign stock insurance company subsidiary of the existing domestic mutual holding company or as a foreign stock insurance company subsidiary of an intermediate stock holding company. The reorganizing foreign mutual insurer may remain a foreign insurer after the restructuring and may be admitted to do business in this state if it meets the applicable requirements of this title. A foreign mutual insurer that is a party to the reorganization may at the same time redomesticate to this state by complying with the applicable requirements of this state and the foreign mutual insurer's state of domicile.

I. After July 1, 1974, any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with subsection H of this section on a specified date before January 1, 1979, which shall be the operative date of subsection H of this section for that insurer if the insurer elects a different operative date for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts from the date that is elected for group annuity and pure endowment contracts. If an insurer does not make an election pursuant to this subsection, the operative date of subsection L of this section shall be January 1, 1979.

J. The minimum standard by calendar year of issue shall be computed as follows:

1. The interest rates that are used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of the following shall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this subsection:

(a) All life insurance policies that are issued in a particular calendar year on or after the operative date of section 20-1231.01.

(b) All individual annuity and pure endowment contracts that are issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1983.

(c) All annuities and pure endowments that are purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1983 under group annuity and pure endowment contracts.

(d) The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1983 in the amounts that are held under guaranteed interest contracts.

2. As used in this paragraph:

(a) R1 is the lesser of R and 0.09, R2 is the greater of R and 0.09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this subsection and W is the weighting factor defined in this subsection, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, or I, shall be determined as follows and the results shall be rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one per cent:

(i) For life insurance:

I = .03 + W(R1 - .03) + W/2 (R2 - .09).

(ii) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options:

I = .03 + W(R - .03).

(iii) Except pursuant to item (ii) of this subdivision, for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on an issue year basis, the formula for life insurance under item (i) of this subdivision applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations of more than ten years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities under item (ii) of this subdivision applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations of ten years or less.

(iv) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities under item (ii) of this subdivision applies.

(v) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities under item (ii) of this subdivision applies.

(b) If the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this subdivision differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one per cent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for those life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For the purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 using the reference interest rate defined in 1979 and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of the operative date of section 20-1231.01.

3. For the purposes of this subsection, the weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated above are given in the following tables:

(a) Weighting factors for life insurance:

Guarantee

Duration    Weighting

(Years)     Factors

Ten years or less .50

More than ten years, but not more than 20 years .45

More than twenty years  .35

(b) For life insurance under subdivision (a) of this paragraph, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values, or both, that are guaranteed in the original policy.

(c) The weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: .80

(d) Except pursuant to subdivision (c) of this paragraph, weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest are as specified and in accordance with this subdivision:

(i) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis:

Guarantee   Weighting Factor

(ii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis, the factors listed in item (i) of this subdivision increased by

Plan type

A      B     C

.15 .25 .05

(iii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis other than those with no cash settlement options that do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis that do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than twelve months after the valuation date, the factors shown in item (i) of this subdivision or derived in item (ii) of this subdivision increased by

Plan type

A       B     C

.05 .05 .05

(iv) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration of more than twenty years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to begin.

(v) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options shall be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this subsection, "issue year basis" means a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract and "change in fund basis" means a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.

4. "Plan type" as used in paragraph 3, subdivision (d) of this subsection means:

(a) Plan type A: A policyholder may withdraw funds at any time only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the insurance company received the funds, without an adjustment but in installments over a period of five years or more, as an immediate life annuity, or a policyholder may not withdraw funds.

(b) Plan type B: Before the interest rate guarantee expires, a policyholder may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the insurance company received the funds, without an adjustment but in installments over a period of five years or more, or a policyholder may not withdraw funds. At the end of the interest rate guarantee, a policyholder may withdraw funds without an adjustment in a single sum or in installments over a period of less than five years.

(c) Plan type C: A policyholder may withdraw funds before the interest rate guarantee expires in a single sum or in installments over a period of less than five years either without an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the insurance company received the funds or subject only to a fixed surrender charge that is stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.

5. For the purposes of this subsection, "reference interest rate" means:

(a) For all life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(b) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(c) Except pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph, for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on an issue year basis, with guarantee duration of more than ten years, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(d) Except pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph, for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on a year of issue basis, with guaranteed duration of ten years or less, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(e) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(f) Except pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph, for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on a change in fund basis, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

6. If Moody's investors service, incorporated no longer publishes the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds or if the national association of insurance commissioners determines that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds as published by Moody's investor service, incorporated is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate that the national association of insurance commissioners adopts and the director approves may be substituted.

K. The reserve valuation method for life insurance and endowment benefits shall be determined as follows:

1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections L, O and Q of this section, reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, are the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by those policies, over the present value of any future modified net premiums. The modified net premiums for any one policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subdivision (a) over subdivision (b) of this paragraph as follows:

(a) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due, provided however that the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such policy.

(b) A net one year term premium for the benefits that are provided for in the first policy year.

2. Any life insurance policy that is issued on or after January 1, 1986 for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and that provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined for the purposes of this paragraph as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium, except as otherwise provided in subsection O of this section, shall be the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in paragraph 1 of this subsection and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with:

(a) The value defined in paragraph 1, subdivision (a) of this subsection being reduced by fifteen per cent of the amount of the excess first year premium.

(b) All present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date.

(c) The policy being assumed to mature on the date as an endowment.

(d) The cash surrender value provided on the date being considered as an endowment benefit.

In making the above comparison the mortality and interest bases stated in subsections G and J of this section shall be used.

3. Reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method for:

(a) Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums.

(b) Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation that is established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the internal revenue code, as amended.

(c) Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts.

(d) All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection.

L. The reserve valuation method for annuity and pure endowment benefits shall be determined as follows:

1. This subsection applies to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation that is established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the internal revenue code, as amended.

2. Reserves according to the commissioners annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in those contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits that are provided for by the contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of the contract, that become payable before the end of the respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate or rates specified in the contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of the contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.

M. A company's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, that are issued on or after the operative date of section 20-1231, shall not be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subsections K, L, O and P of this section and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for the policies. The aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts and benefits shall not be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection E of this section.

N. Optional reserves may be calculated as follows:

1. At the option of the insurer, reserves for all policies and contracts that are issued before the operative date of section 20-1231 may be calculated according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately before that date.

2. At the option of the insurer, reserves for any category of policies, contracts or benefits that the director establishes and that are issued on or after the operative date of section 20-1231 may be calculated according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for that category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this section, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for in the policy or contract.

3. An insurer that at any time has adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided by this section, with the director's approval, may adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum provided by this section. For the purposes of this section, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection E of this section shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.

O. Reserves when the valuation net premium exceeds the gross premium charged shall be calculated as follows:

1. If in any contract year the gross premium charged by a company on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for the policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for the policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this subsection are those standards stated in subsections G and J of this section.

2. For any life insurance policy that is issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for that excess and that provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination in an amount greater than the excess premium, this subsection applies as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for the policy was the method described in subsection K, paragraphs 1 and 3 of this section. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection K of this section, including paragraph 2 of that subsection, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.

P. If a plan of life insurance provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or if the minimum reserves of a plan of life insurance or annuity cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections K, L and O of this section, the reserves that are held under any plan must:

1. Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan.

2. Be computed by a method that is consistent with the principles of this section, as determined by rules adopted by the director related to the minimum standards applicable to the valuation of health plans.

Q. For accident and health insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under subsection D, paragraph 1 of this section.  For disability insurance contracts issued on or after the operative date of section 20-1231 and before the operative date of the valuation manual, the minimum standard of valuation is the standard adopted by the director by rule.

R. The following apply to the valuation manual for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual:

1. For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the standard prescribed in the valuation manual is the minimum standard of valuation required under subsection D, paragraph 1 of this section, except as provided under paragraph 5 or 7 of this subsection.

The owners of special deposit claims against an insurer for which a receiver is appointed in this or any other state shall be given priority against their several special deposits, including without limitation assets comprising the applicable separate account, in accordance with the provisions of the statutes governing the creation and maintenance of such deposits. If there is a deficiency in any such deposit so that the claims secured are not fully discharged, the claimants may share in the general assets, but such sharing shall be deferred until general creditors, all other persons who are entitled to priority under subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section, and also claimants against other special deposits who have received smaller percentages from their respective special deposits have been paid percentages of their claims equal to the percentage paid from the special deposit, subject to the applicable terms of any variable life contract, variable annuity contract or guaranteed investment contract that is supported by a separate account to the extent it is guaranteed by the general account.

K. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a federal home loan bank may not be stayed, enjoined or prohibited from exercising or enforcing any right or cause of action against collateral pledged by an insurer member under any federal home loan bank security agreement or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee agreement or other similar arrangement or credit enhancement relating to a security agreement to which that federal home loan bank is a party.

D. No claim of any secured claimant shall be allowed at a sum greater than the difference between the value of the claim without security and the value of the security itself as of the date of the entry of the order of liquidation or such other date set by the court for determining rights and liabilities as provided in section 20-635 unless the claimant surrenders the claimant's security to the receiver, in which event the claim shall be allowed in the full amount for which it is valued.

#### Section 20-640. Time to file claims

A. If, upon the granting of an order of liquidation under this article or at any time thereafter during the liquidation proceeding, the insurer is not clearly solvent, the court shall, after such notice and hearing as it deems proper, make an order declaring the insurer to be insolvent. Thereupon regardless of any prior notice which may have been given to creditors, the receiver shall notify all persons who may have claims against the insurer and who have not filed proper proofs thereof to present them to him, at a place specified in the notice, within four months from the date of entry of the order, or if the receiver certifies that it is necessary, within such longer time as the court shall prescribe. The last day for filing of proofs of claims shall be specified in the notice, and notice shall be given in a manner to be determined by the court.

#### Section 20-666. Assessments; notification; exemptions; setoffs; refunds

B. The assessment of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account. The board shall notify each member insurer of the assessment not later than thirty days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any year on any account an amount greater than one per cent of such member insurer's net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account.

C. Except for the workers' compensation insurance account, if the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the fund in any account, does not provide in any one year in any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from such account, the funds available may be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon as funds become available. The board shall pay claims in any order which it may deem reasonable, including the payment of claims as such claims are received from the claimants or in groups or categories of claims.

D. The board may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer, if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance.

E. Each member insurer serving as a servicing facility may set off against any assessment, authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of such claims by the member insurer if they are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made.

F. In addition to all other assessments, the board may assess each member insurer in an amount not to exceed two hundred dollars per year for the purpose of paying for operating expenses of the board and employees of the board.

G. If, at the end of any calendar year, the board finds that the assets of the fund in any account exceed the liabilities of such account as estimated by the board for the coming year, the board may refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to such account the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the liabilities. All refunds will be contingent upon the return of a member insurer's certificate(s) of contribution and will be in an amount equal to the premium tax offset value of the relinquished certificate.

In no event shall the fund be obligated to a policyholder or claimant in any amount in excess of the face amount of the policy from which the claim arises.

C. The fund is deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent. Notwithstanding any other law, the fund is not obligated to pay any amount that does not constitute a payment of a covered claim, including taxable costs, attorney fees or interest that could be awarded or any additional liabilities or obligations that might otherwise exist or accrue against the insolvent insurer if the insurer had not become insolvent.

D. Any settlement of a covered claim that is entered into with any insured or claimant within four months before the determination of insolvency and that has not been paid is voidable by the fund for six months after the determination of the insolvency or six months after the fund discovers or should have discovered the settlement, whichever is later.

E. Notwithstanding subsection D of this section, a settlement or commutation of a workers' compensation claim approved by an award of the industrial commission that has become final pursuant to section 23-942 or 23-943 is not voidable.

A claimant for workers' compensation benefits shall have all rights and obligations conferred under title 23, chapter 6.

B. Any person having a claim that may be recovered under more than one insurance guaranty fund or its equivalent or who is insured under more than one policy shall first exhaust coverage from the fund of the place of residence of the insured or, if it is a first-party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, shall first exhaust coverage from the fund of the location of the property, or shall first exhaust coverage under the other policy, and if it is a workers' compensation claim, recovery shall be sought from the guaranty fund or its equivalent of the place of residence of the claimant.

The claimant shall have no claim against the insured of the insolvent carrier or the fund if the full amount of uninsured motorist coverage was not recovered by the claimant. A member insurer shall have no right of subrogation against the insured of the insolvent carrier or against the fund for any amount paid by the insurer under uninsured motorist coverage. A member insurer may file a claim for subrogation payments under uninsured motorist coverage against the ancillary or domiciliary receiver of the insolvent insurer.

E. The fund shall receive the proceeds of any amounts recoverable on reinsurance contracts or treaties entered into by the insolvent insurer that cover any of the liabilities incurred by the insolvent insurer in the category or categories involved. The proceeds shall be limited to payments on or loss adjustment expenses or defense costs actually incurred by the fund on account of claims covered in the contracts or treaties. The director, as receiver or ancillary receiver, shall receive the proceeds of any reinsurance recoverable to the extent of payment on claims, loss adjustment expenses or defense costs made before the order of liquidation.

A member shall at its option have the right to show a certificate of contribution as an asset in the form approved by the director at percentages of the original face amount approved by the director, for calendar years as follows:

1. One hundred per cent for the calendar year of issuance.

2. Eighty per cent for the first calendar year after the year of issuance.

#### Section 20-675. Immunity and indemnification

A. There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action shall rise against, the fund, any member insurer, the board or its agents or employees, the director or representatives of the director for any action taken in the performance of their powers and duties pursuant to this article.

B. The board and its agents or employees shall be indemnified by the fund against all expenses incurred in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought against such person on account of any action taken in the performance of the powers and duties of such person pursuant to this article, unless such person is finally adjudged to have committed a breach of duty involving gross negligence, bad faith, dishonesty, wilful malfeasance or reckless disregard of the responsibilities of his or her office. In the event of settlement before the final adjudication, such indemnity shall be provided only if the board is advised by independent counsel selected by the board that such person did not, in the counsel's opinion, commit such a breach of duty.

C. The fund's reimbursement of such expenses of indemnification shall be prorated and paid for by the member insurers in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of each member insurer for the calendar year preceding the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year.

#### Section 20-676. Stay of proceedings

A. All proceedings in which the insolvent insurer or the insolvent insurer's insured is a party in any court of this state shall be stayed for six months from the date the insolvency is determined or an ancillary proceeding is instituted in this state, whichever is later, to permit proper defense by the fund of all pending causes of action as to any covered claim. At the request of any party and on a showing of good cause, the court may shorten or lengthen the stay prescribed in this section. This subsection does not apply to proceedings in which the insolvent insurer is a party to a proceeding before the industrial commission regarding an employee's entitlement to benefits under title 23, chapter 6, except that, on a showing of good cause, the industrial commission shall grant up to a ninety-day continuance of any scheduled hearing to allow the fund to assume the defense and investigate the claim.

B. On application of the fund, either on the fund's own behalf or on the insured's behalf, the court may set aside any judgment, order, decision, verdict, finding or award arising from the default of the insolvent insurer or the insurer's failure to defend the insured and the fund shall be allowed to defend the claim on the merits.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a federal home loan bank may not be stayed, enjoined or prohibited from exercising or enforcing any right or cause of action against collateral pledged by an insurer member under any federal home loan bank security agreement or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee agreement or other similar arrangement or credit enhancement relating to a security agreement to which that federal home loan bank is a party.

F. Any persons receiving benefits pursuant to this article shall be deemed to have assigned their rights under, and any causes of action against any person for losses arising under, resulting from or otherwise relating to, the covered policy or contract to the fund to the extent of the benefits received whether the benefits are payments of contractual obligations, continuation of coverage or provision of substitute or alternative policies, contracts or coverages. The fund may require an assignment to the fund of such rights by any enrollee, payee, policy or contract owner, beneficiary, insured or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any rights or benefits conferred on such person pursuant to this article.

D. The fund may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the fund, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.

E. If an assessment against a member insurer is abated or deferred, in whole or in part, because of the limitations set forth in subsection D of this section, the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the fund in either account, does not provide in any one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the fund, the necessary additional monies shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this article.

F. The fund, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, may refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account, the amount the fund finds is not necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the fund with regard to such amount, including assets accruing from net realized gains and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the fund and for future losses.

G. Any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policyowner dividends as to any kind of insurance or health care services organization business within the scope of this article, may consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations.

H. The fund shall issue to each member insurer paying an assessment a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the director, for the amount paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the member insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount and period of time as the director may approve.

3. When an impairment is declared and the amount of the impairment is determined, serve a demand on the impaired insurer to make good the impairment within a reasonable time.  Notice to the impaired insurer shall constitute notice to its shareholders. The failure of the impaired insurer to promptly comply with such demand shall not excuse the board from the performance of its duties pursuant to this article.

B. The director may suspend or revoke, after notice and a hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10, the certificate of authority to transact business in this state of any member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation.  As an alternative the director may levy a forfeiture on any member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due.  Such forfeiture shall not exceed five percent of the unpaid assessment per month, but no forfeiture may be less than one hundred dollars per month.

2. The board of directors, on majority vote, may request that the director order an examination of any member insurer which the board in good faith believes may be unable or potentially unable to fulfill its contractual obligations. The director may conduct such examination. The examination may be conducted as a national association of insurance commissioners examination or may be conducted by such persons as the director designates. The cost of such examination shall be paid by the fund and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports. The examination report shall not be released to the board of directors of the fund before its release to the public, but this shall not excuse the director from the obligation to comply with paragraph 3. The director shall notify the board of directors when the examination is completed. The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the director but it shall not be open to the public and shall be released only if the examination discloses that the examined insurer is unable or potentially unable to meet its contractual obligations.

B. Records shall be kept of all negotiations and meetings in which the fund or its representatives are involved to discuss the activities of the fund in carrying out its powers and duties. Records of such negotiations or meetings shall be made public only on the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation proceeding involving the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer, on the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer or on the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

C. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations pursuant to this article, the board shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to policies reduced by any amounts to which the board is entitled as subrogee. All assets of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer attributable to policies shall be used to continue all policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer. As used in this subsection, "assets attributable to policies" means that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies or contracts bear to the reserve that should have been established for all policies of insurance or health benefit plans written by the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer.

D. Before the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties including the board, the shareholders, contract owners, certificate holders, enrollees and policyowners of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer and any other party with a bona fide interest in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of such impaired insurer or insolvent insurer. In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policyholders, contract owners, certificate holders and enrollees of the continuing or successor member insurer. No distribution to stockholders of the assets of an impaired insurer or insolvent insurer may be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the fund with interest thereon for monies expended in carrying out its powers and duties under section 20-685 with respect to such insurer is fully recovered by the fund.

E. If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a member insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under such order may recover on behalf of the member insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the member insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the following limitations:

1. No such dividend shall be recoverable if the member insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable and that the member insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.

2. Any person who as an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions the person received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were declared shall be liable up to the amount of distributions the person would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they are jointly and severally liable.

3. The maximum amount recoverable pursuant to this subsection shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer.

4. If any person liable pursuant to paragraph 2 is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the dividend was paid are jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.

F. The receiver, conservator, liquidator or statutory successor of an impaired insurer or insolvent insurer is bound by a settlement of covered claims by the fund or a similar organization in another state.

C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the total amount a member insurer may offset against its premium tax liability pursuant to a certificate of contribution that is issued from 1987 through 1994 shall not exceed the following percentage amounts for each certificate of contribution, except that in no event may the total amount of the offset exceed one hundred percent of each assessment:

1. For 1991, seven percent.

2. For 1992, nine percent.

3. For 1993, eleven percent.

4. For 1994, thirteen percent.

E. Beginning in 1995, the total amount that a member insurer may offset against its premium tax liability pursuant to a certificate of contribution shall be as provided in subsection B of this section, except that in no event shall the total amount of the offset exceed one hundred percent of the assessment.

As to a judgment under any decision, order, verdict or finding based on default, the board may apply to have such judgment set aside by the same court that made such judgment and shall be permitted to defend against such suit on the merits.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section or any other provision of this chapter, a receiver, rehabilitator, liquidator or conservator may not void any transfer of, or any obligation to transfer, money or other property arising under or in connection with any federal home loan bank security agreement with an insurer member, or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee agreement or any other similar arrangement or credit enhancement relating to a federal home loan bank security agreement with an insurer member unless the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either existing or future creditors.

#### Section 20-695. Statute of limitations

D. Unrealized contingent liability of members does not constitute an asset of the insurer in any determination of its financial condition.

#### Section 20-718. Enforcement of contingent liability

A. If at any time the assets of a domestic mutual insurer are less than its liabilities and the minimum amount of surplus required of it by this title for authority to transact the kinds of insurance being transacted, and the deficiency is not cured from other sources, its directors shall levy an assessment only on its members who, at any time within the twelve months immediately preceding the date notice of such assessment was mailed to them, held policies providing for contingent liability, and such members shall be liable to the insurer for the amount so assessed.

B. The assessment shall be for such an amount as is required to cure such deficiency and to provide a reasonable amount of working funds above such minimum amount of surplus, but such working funds so provided shall not exceed five percent of the insurer's liabilities as of the date on which the amount of such deficiency was determined.

C. No one policy or member as to such policy shall be assessed or charged with an aggregate of contingent liability as to obligations incurred by the insurer in any one calendar year, in excess of the number of times the premium as stated in the policy as computed solely on premium earned on such policy during that year.

D. No member shall have an offset against any assessment for which the member is liable, on account of any claim for unearned premium or loss payable.

#### Section 20-719. Issuance of nonassessable policies by mutual insurers

A. While it maintains on deposit with the state treasurer through the director surplus funds in an amount not less than the paid-in capital required of a domestic stock insurer transacting like kinds of insurance, a domestic mutual insurer may extinguish the contingent liability of its members as to all its policies in force, and may omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all its policies currently issued.

Any such classification or determination shall be reasonable, and shall not unfairly discriminate as between policyholders within the same such classification.

A. The directors of a domestic mutual insurer may from time to time apportion and pay or credit to its members dividends only from that part of its surplus funds which represents net realized savings and net realized earnings from its business.

Any director of a domestic stock or mutual insurer who knowingly votes for or concurs in declaration or payment of an illegal dividend to stockholders or members is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor and is jointly and severally liable, together with other such directors, for any loss thereby sustained by the insurer.

B. The stockholders or members knowingly receiving such an illegal dividend shall be liable in the amount of the illegal dividend to the insurer.

C. The director of the department of insurance and financial institutions may revoke or suspend the certificate of authority of an insurer that has declared or paid an illegal dividend.

B. The surplus note shall provide that the holder's interest is subordinate to the claims of policyholders, claimants and beneficiaries and to all other classes of creditors other than surplus noteholders and that interest payments and principal payments require prior approval of the director.

C.

D. Before entering a loan transaction as described in this section, a domestic mutual insurer shall file with the director a statement of the purposes of the loan and a copy of the proposed loan agreement, which shall be subject to the director's approval. The loan and agreement shall be deemed approved unless within fifteen days after the date of filing the insurer is notified in writing of the director's disapproval and the reasons for the disapproval.  The director shall disapprove any proposed loan or agreement if the director finds that the loan is reasonably unnecessary or excessive for the purpose intended, that the terms of the loan agreement are not fair and equitable to the parties and to other similar lenders, if any, or to the insurer or that the information so filed by the insurer is inadequate, specifying the inadequacies.

E. A mutual insurer shall repay the loan or a substantial portion of the loan when the loan is no longer reasonably necessary for the purpose originally intended and after receiving the director's approval for repayment.

F. This section does not apply to loans obtained by the insurer in the ordinary course of business from banks and other financial institutions nor to loans secured by a pledge of assets.

B. For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner, corporate director or officer by reason of his relationship to such company, any profit realized by him from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of any equity security of such company within any period of less than six months unless such equity security was acquired in good faith in connection with a debt previously contracted, shall inure to and be recoverable by the company, irrespective of any intention on the part of such beneficial owner, director or officer in entering into such transaction of holding the equity security purchased or of not repurchasing the equity security sold for a period exceeding six months.

4. The policyholders entitled to participate in the purchase of stock or distribution of assets include all current policyholders and all existing persons who had been a policyholder of the insurer within three years before the date such plan was submitted to the director.

Such contingent liability may be at the rate of not less than one nor more than ten times the premium or premium deposit stated in the policy, and the maximum aggregate thereof shall be computed in the manner set forth in section 20-786.

C. Each assessable policy issued by the insurer shall contain a statement of the contingent liability, set in type of the same prominence as the insuring clause.

B. Each subscriber's share of a deficiency for which an assessment is made, but not exceeding in any event his aggregate contingent liability as computed in accordance with section 20-786, shall be computed by applying to the premium earned on the subscriber's policy or policies during the period to be covered by the assessment, the ratio of the total deficiency to the total premiums earned during such period upon all policies subject to the assessment.

C. In computing the earned premiums for the purposes of this section, the gross premium received by the insurer for the policy shall be used as a base, deducting therefrom solely charges not recurring upon the renewal or extension of the policy.

D. No subscriber shall have an offset against any assessment for which he is liable, on account of any claim for unearned premium or losses payable.

 

#### Section 20-785. Time limit for assessment

Every subscriber of a domestic reciprocal insurer having contingent liability shall be liable for, and shall pay his share of any assessment, as computed and limited in accordance with this article, if:

No one policy or subscriber as to such policy, shall be assessed or charged with an aggregate of contingent liability as to obligations incurred by a domestic reciprocal insurer in any one calendar year, in excess of the amount provided for in the power of attorney or in the subscribers' agreement, computed solely upon premium earned on such policy during that year.

 

#### Section 20-787. Nonassessable policies

A. If a reciprocal insurer has a surplus of assets over all liabilities at least equal to the minimum capital stock generally required of a domestic stock insurer authorized to transact like kinds of insurance, upon application of the attorney and as approved by the subscribers' advisory committee the director shall issue his certificate authorizing the insurer to extinguish the contingent liability of subscribers under its policies then in force in this state, and to omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all policies delivered or issued for delivery in this state for so long as all such surplus remains unimpaired.

B. Upon impairment of the surplus, the director shall forthwith revoke the certificate. The revocation shall not render subject to contingent liability any policy then in force and for the remainder of the period for which the premium has theretofore been paid, but after such revocation no policy shall be issued or renewed without providing for contingent assessment liability of the subscriber.

C. The director shall not authorize a domestic reciprocal insurer so to extinguish the contingent liability of any of its subscribers or in any of its policies to be issued, unless it qualifies to and does extinguish such liability of all its subscribers and in all such policies for all kinds of insurance transacted by it, but if required by the laws of another state in which the insurer is transacting insurance as an authorized insurer, the insurer may issue policies providing for the contingent liability of such of its subscribers as may acquire such policies in such state, and need not extinguish the contingent liability applicable to policies theretofore in force in such state.

 

#### Section 20-788. Distribution of savings

A reciprocal insurer may from time to time return to its subscribers any unused premiums, savings or credits accruing to their accounts.

#### Section 20-789. Subscriber's share in assets

Upon the liquidation of a domestic reciprocal insurer, its assets remaining after discharge of its indebtedness and policy obligations, the return of any contributions of the attorney or other persons to its surplus made as provided in section 20-778, and the return of any unused premium, savings or credits then standing on subscribers' accounts, shall be distributed to its subscribers who were such within the twelve months prior to the last termination of its certificate of authority, according to such reasonable formula as the director may approve.

 

#### Section 20-790. Merger or conversion

A. A domestic reciprocal insurer upon affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of its subscribers who vote on such merger pursuant to due notice and the approval of the director of the terms therefor, may merge with another reciprocal insurer or be converted to a stock or mutual insurer.

B. Such a stock or mutual insurer shall be subject to the same capital requirements and shall have the same rights as a like domestic insurer transacting like kinds of insurance.

C. The director shall not approve any plan for merger or conversion which is inequitable to subscribers, or which, if for conversion to a stock insurer, does not give each subscriber preferential right to acquire stock of the proposed insurer proportionate to his interest in the reciprocal insurer as determined in accordance with section 20-789 and a reasonable length of time within which to exercise such right.

#### Section 20-791. Impaired reciprocal insurers

A. If the assets of a reciprocal insurer are at any time insufficient to discharge its liabilities, other than any liability on account of funds contributed by the attorney or others, and to maintain the required surplus, its attorney shall forthwith make up the deficiency or levy an assessment upon the subscribers for the amount needed to make up the deficiency, but subject to the limitation set forth in the power of attorney or policy.

B. If the attorney fails to make up the deficiency or to make the assessment within thirty days after the director orders him to do so, or if the deficiency is not fully made up within sixty days after the date the assessment was made, the insurer shall be deemed insolvent and shall be proceeded against as authorized by this title.

C. If liquidation of such an insurer is ordered, an assessment shall be levied upon the subscribers for such an amount, subject to limits as provided by this article, as the director determines to be necessary to discharge all liabilities of the insurer, exclusive of any funds contributed by the attorney or other persons, but including the reasonable cost of the liquidation.

#### Section 20-792. Ownership of real property

Legal title of real property acquired as an eligible investment in accordance with section 20-556 must be held in the name of the reciprocal insurer. Notwithstanding any other provision in this section, all deeds, notes, mortgages or other documents relating to the purchase, sale, lease, encumbrance or other interest in such real property may be executed in the name of the reciprocal insurer by its attorney-in-fact.

On receipt of the affidavit, the corporation shall issue to the religiously affiliated employer a contract that excludes coverage for specific items or services required under subsection Y of this section.  The corporation shall retain the affidavit for the duration of the contract and any renewals of the contract. This subsection shall not exclude coverage for prescription contraceptive methods ordered by a health care provider with prescriptive authority for medical indications other than for contraceptive, abortifacient, abortion or sterilization purposes. A religiously affiliated employer offering the plan may state religious beliefs in its affidavit and may require the subscriber to first pay for the prescription and then submit a claim to the hospital service corporation, medical service corporation or hospital, medical, dental and optometric service corporation along with evidence that the prescription is not for a purpose covered by the objection.

The following requirements apply to coverage of telehealth services:

1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a corporation may not limit or deny the coverage of health care services provided through telehealth, including ancillary services, and may apply only the same limits or exclusions on a health care service provided through telehealth that are applicable to an in-person encounter for the same health care service, except for procedures or services for which the weight of evidence, based on practice guidelines, peer-reviewed clinical publications or research or recommendations by the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607, determines not to be appropriate to be provided through telehealth.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a corporation shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system, whether provided through telehealth using an audio-visual format or in-person care.  A corporation shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent in-person behavioral health and substance use disorder services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system if provided through telehealth using an audio-only format. This paragraph does not apply to a telehealth encounter provided through a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the corporation.  A corporation may not require a health care provider to use a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the corporation as a condition of network participation.

4. A health care provider shall bill for a telehealth encounter using the healthcare common procedure coding system and shall identify whether the telehealth encounter was provided in an audio-only or audio-video format.  To submit a claim for an audio-only service, the health care provider must make telehealth services generally available to patients through the interactive use of audio, video or other electronic media.

At the time of the telehealth encounter, the health care provider shall access clinical information and records, if available, that are appropriate to evaluate the patient's condition.  The health care provider shall inform the subscriber before the telehealth encounter if there is a charge for the encounter.

6. A corporation may establish reasonable requirements and parameters for telehealth services, including documentation, fraud prevention, identity verification and recordkeeping, but such requirements and parameters may not be more restrictive or less favorable to health care providers or subscribers than are required for health care services delivered in person.

7. Covered telehealth services may be provided regardless of where the subscriber is located or the type of site.

8. Except in an emergency as prescribed in section 20-2803, the contract may limit the coverage to those health care providers who are members of the corporation's provider network.

B. Subsection A of this section does not:

1. Limit the ability of corporations to provide incentives to subscribers that are designed to improve health outcomes, increase adherence to a course of treatment or reduce risk.

2. Prevent corporations from offering network contracts to health care providers who employ value-based purchasing or bundled payment methodologies if otherwise allowed by law or prevent health care providers from voluntarily agreeing to enter into such contracts with a corporation.

Network adequacy standards required by federal or state law may not be met by a corporation through the use of contracted health care providers who provide only telehealth services and do not provide in-person health care services in this state or within fifty miles of the border of this state.

D. This section does not prevent a corporation from imposing deductibles or copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or coinsurance applicable to an in-person encounter for the same health care service.  If the corporation waives a deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement that impacts a health care provider's contracted reimbursement rate, the corporation shall reimburse the health care provider for the cost of the deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement to ensure that the health care provider receives the contracted reimbursement rate if the service is covered and the claim meets other requirements of the network participation agreement.

E. Services provided through telehealth or resulting from a telehealth encounter are subject to all of this state's laws and rules that govern prescribing, dispensing and administering prescription pharmaceuticals and devices and shall comply with Arizona licensure requirements and any practice guidelines of the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607 or, if not addressed, the practice guidelines of a national association of medical professionals promoting access to medical care for consumers via telecommunications technology or other qualified medical professional societies to ensure quality of care.

In a civil action a person shall not be indemnified or reimbursed if a court of competent jurisdiction finds that the person breached a duty owed as a director, officer, employee or agent of the society or the matter is the subject of a settlement, unless the person acted in good faith for a purpose the person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the society. In a criminal action a person shall not be indemnified or reimbursed if the person negotiates a plea bargain or is found guilty in a court of competent jurisdiction of an offense relating to his position of director, officer, employee or agent of the society unless the person had no reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was unlawful. The supreme governing body or board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine if the person acted in good faith. The termination of an action, suit or proceeding or a plea of no contest does not create a conclusive presumption that the person failed to act in good faith. The right of indemnification and reimbursement does not abrogate any other right to which the person is entitled as a matter of law and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of the person.

C. A society may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the society or who is or was serving at the request of the society as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other firm, corporation or organization against any liability that is asserted against the person and that the person incurred in his capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent. A society may purchase and maintain insurance pursuant to this subsection regardless of the society's ability to indemnify the person.

D. A director, officer, employee, member or volunteer of a society who serves without compensation is not personally liable and no action may be maintained against him in his individual capacity for damages resulting from an act or omission within the scope of his duties and responsibilities unless the act or omission was caused by wanton or wilful misconduct.

 

#### Section 20-868. Waiver

The laws of the society may provide that a subordinate body or any subordinate officers or members shall not waive any provision of the laws of the society. A provision prohibiting waiver is binding on the society, its members and every member's beneficiaries.

 

 

#### Section 20-869. Organization

Beginning on January 1, 1995, a domestic fraternal benefit society may be organized as follows:

1. Seven or more citizens of the United States, a majority of whom are citizens of this state, who desire to form a fraternal benefit society may make, sign and acknowledge articles of incorporation before an officer who is competent to take acknowledgement of deeds. The articles of incorporation shall state all of the following:

(a) The proposed corporate name of the society. The proposed name shall not so closely resemble the name of any society or insurance company as to be misleading or confusing.

(b) The purposes for which the society is being formed and the mode in which its corporate powers will be exercised. The purposes shall not include powers that are more liberal than those granted by this article.

(c) The names and residences of the incorporators and the names, residences and official titles of all of the officers, trustees, directors or other persons who are to have and exercise the general control and the management of the affairs and funds of the society for the first year or until the ensuing election at which all of the officers shall be elected by the supreme governing body and that shall be held not later than one year from the date of issuance of the permanent certificate of authority.

2. The applicants shall file with the director the articles of incorporation, duly certified copies of the constitution and laws and rules, copies of all proposed forms of certificates, applications and circulars to be issued by the society and a bond conditioned on the return to the applicants of the advance payments if the organization is not completed within one year. The bond with sureties approved by the director shall be in an amount determined by the director of not less than three hundred thousand dollars or more than one million five hundred thousand dollars. All of the documents that are filed with the director shall be in English. If the purposes of the society conform to the requirements of this article and if all applicable provisions of law have been complied with, the director shall certify, retain and file the articles of incorporation and shall furnish to the incorporators a preliminary certificate of authority authorizing the society to solicit members pursuant to this section.

3. A preliminary certificate of authority is not valid after one year from its date of issuance or after a further period of time of not more than one year that is authorized by the director for good cause unless the five hundred applicants as required by this section have been secured and the organization has been completed pursuant to this article. The articles of incorporation and all proceedings authorized by the articles of incorporation become null and void one year from the date of the preliminary certificate or at the expiration of the extended period, unless the society has completed its organization and received a final certificate of authority to do business pursuant to this section.

4. On receipt of the preliminary certificate of authority from the director, the society may solicit members for the purpose of completing its organization, shall collect from each applicant the amount of not less than one regular monthly premium in accordance with its table of rates and shall issue to each applicant a receipt for the amount collected. A society shall not incur liability other than for the return of the advance payment, issue any certificate or pay, allow or offer or promise to pay or allow any death or disability benefit to any person until:

(a) Actual bona fide applications for benefits have been secured on not less than five hundred applicants and any necessary evidence of insurability has been furnished to and approved by the society.

(b) At least ten subordinate lodges have been established into which the five hundred applicants have been admitted.

(c) The treasurer or other corresponding officer of the society submits to the director a sworn statement showing that at least five hundred applicants have each paid in cash at least one regular monthly payment pursuant to this section and that the payments in the aggregate amount to at least one hundred fifty thousand dollars. The advance premiums shall be held in trust during the period of organization. If the society does not qualify for a certificate of authority within one year, the premiums shall be returned to the applicants.

5. The director may make any examination and require further information as the director deems advisable. After the society presents satisfactory evidence that it has complied with any applicable provisions of law, the director shall issue a certificate of authority to that effect. The certificate of authority is prima facie evidence of the existence of the society at the date of the certificate. The director shall record the certificate of authority. A certified copy of the record may be given in evidence.

6. An incorporated society that is authorized to transact business in this state, on or before January 1, 1995 is not required to reincorporate.

#### Section 20-870. Amendment to society laws

A. The supreme governing body of a domestic society may amend its laws in accordance with its laws at any regular or special meeting, or if the laws provide, by referendum. A referendum may be held in accordance with the society's laws by the vote of the voting members of the society, the vote of the delegates or representatives of voting members or the vote of local lodges. An amendment that is referred shall not be adopted unless within six months from the date of the submission of the referendum a majority of the members voting consent to the amendment.

B. A society may provide for voting by mail.

C. A society shall file a certified copy of any amendment to its laws within ninety days after the amendment is enacted.

 

 

#### Section 20-871. Authority to maintain institutions

A. A society may create, maintain and operate or establish an organization to operate not for profit institutions to further the purposes of the society as prescribed by section 20-864. An institution established pursuant to this section may provide services for free or for a reasonable charge.

B. The society shall report in each annual statement any real or personal property that the society owns, holds or leases for the purposes of any institutions established pursuant to this section, except that the property shall not be allowed as an admitted asset of the society.

#### Section 20-872. Reinsurance

A. Pursuant to a reinsurance agreement, a domestic fraternal benefit society may cede any part or all of its risks to an insurer other than another fraternal benefit society that has the power to take the reinsurance and that is authorized to transact business in this state, or if the reinsurer is not authorized to transact business in this state, that is approved by the director. A society may not reinsure substantially all of its insurance in force without the written permission of the director. A society may take credit for the reserves on the ceded risks to the extent that the risks are reinsured. Any credit taken by a ceding society is not allowed as an admitted asset or as a deduction from liability for reinsurance that is made, ceded, renewed or otherwise effective after January 1, 1995, unless the reinsurance is payable by the assuming insurer on the basis of the liability of the ceding society under the contract or contracts reinsured without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding society.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a society may reinsure the risks of another society in a consolidation or merger that is approved by the director pursuant to section 20-873.

 

#### Section 20-873. Consolidation or merger

A. A domestic fraternal benefit society may consolidate or merge with any other society if it complies with this section. The society shall file the following with the director:

1. A certified copy of the written contract that contains in full the terms and conditions of the consolidation or merger.

2. A sworn statement by the president and secretary or other corresponding officers of each society that shows the financial condition of each society on a date designated by the director. The date shall not be earlier than December 31 next preceding the date of the contract.

3. A verified certificate of the president and secretary or other corresponding officers of each society stating that the consolidation or merger has been approved by a two-thirds vote of the supreme governing body of each society and that the vote was conducted at a regular or special meeting of each society, or if allowed by the laws of the society, by mail.

4. Evidence that at least sixty days before the action of the supreme governing body of each society the text of the contract was furnished to all members of each society either by mail or publication in full in the official publication of each society.  The affidavit of any officer of the society or of any person who is authorized by the society to mail any notice or document stating that the notice or document was addressed and mailed is prima facie evidence that the notice or document was furnished to the addressees.

B. The director shall approve the consolidation or merger and shall issue a certificate of approval if the director finds that the contract conforms with the requirements of this section, that the financial statements are correct and that the consolidation or merger is just and equitable to the members of each society. On the director's approval, the contract is in full force and effect, except that if one of the parties to the contract is incorporated under the laws of any other state or territory, the consolidation or merger does not become effective until the consolidation or merger is approved pursuant to the laws of that state or territory and a certificate of approval is filed with the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions in this state. If the laws of the other state or territory do not provide for consolidation or merger, the consolidation or merger does not become effective until it has been approved by and a certificate of approval is filed with the insurance director in that state or territory.

C. After the consolidation or merger becomes effective, all of the rights, franchises and interests of the consolidated or merged societies in and to real, personal and mixed property are vested in the society resulting from or remaining after the consolidation or merger. No other instrument is necessary to convey any property interests, except that conveyances of real property shall be evidenced by proper deeds. The title to any real estate or any interest in real estate that is vested under the laws of this state in any of the societies that are consolidated or merged does not revert or is not impaired in any way by reason of the merger or consolidation but vests absolutely in the society that results from or remains after the consolidation or merger.

#### Section 20-874. Conversion of fraternal benefit society to mutual life insurance company

A domestic fraternal benefit society may convert to and be licensed as a mutual life insurance company by complying with the requirements of this title relating to mutual insurers. The board of directors shall prepare a plan of conversion in writing. The plan of conversion shall prescribe the terms and conditions of conversion. The affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the supreme governing body at a regular or special meeting is required for approval of the plan. A plan of conversion is not effective unless it is approved by the director. The director may approve the plan of conversion if the director finds that the proposed change conforms to the law and is not prejudicial to the certificate holders of the society.

#### Section 20-875. Benefits

A. A fraternal benefit society may provide the following contractual benefits in any form:

1. Death benefits.

2. Endowment benefits.

3. Annuity benefits.

4. Temporary or permanent disability benefits.

5. Hospital, medical or nursing benefits.

6. Monument or tombstone benefits to the memory of deceased members.

7. Any other benefits that are authorized for life insurers and that are not prescribed by this article.

B. A society shall specify by rule those persons who may be issued or covered by the contractual benefits prescribed by subsection A. The rules shall be consistent with providing benefits to members and dependents of members. On the application of an adult member, a society may provide benefits on the lives of children who are under the minimum age for adult membership.

C. Any benefit or combination of benefits authorized by this section may be provided in the same certificate, and the certificates may be participating.

 

 

#### Section 20-876. Beneficiaries

A. At all times the owner of a benefit contract may change the beneficiary or beneficiaries in accordance with the laws or rules of the society unless the owner waives this right and requests in writing that the beneficiary designation be irrevocable. A society may limit the scope of beneficiary designations and shall provide that no revocable beneficiary has or may obtain any vested interest in the proceeds of a certificate until the certificate becomes due and payable in conformity with the provisions of the benefit contract.

B. A society may provide for the payment of funeral benefits to the extent of that portion of any payment under a certificate that reasonably appears to be due to any person who is equitably entitled to the payment and who incurred expenses resulting from the burial of a member. Any amount paid pursuant to this section shall not exceed one thousand dollars.

C. If a lawful beneficiary to whom death benefits are payable does not exist at the death of a person insured under a benefit contract, the benefit shall be paid to the estate of the deceased insured, except to the extent that funeral benefits have been paid pursuant to subsection B. If the owner of the certificate is a person other than the insured, the benefits shall be paid to the certificate owner.

#### Section 20-877. Benefits not attachable

Any money or other benefit, charity, relief or aid that a society pays, provides or renders is not subject to attachment, garnishment or other process and shall not be seized, taken, appropriated or applied to pay any debt or liability of any member, beneficiary or other person who may have a right under a benefit contract, either before or after the society pays the benefit.

#### Section 20-878. Benefit contract

A. A society shall issue to each owner of a benefit contract a certificate that specifies the amount of benefits provided under the certificate. The certificate shall state that it constitutes the benefit contract as of the date of issuance of the certificate, together with any riders or endorsements attached to the certificate, the laws of the society, the application for membership, the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, signed by the applicant and all amendments to any of these. A copy of the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, shall be endorsed on or attached to the certificate. All statements on the application are representations and not warranties. Any waiver of this provision is void.

B. Any amendments to the laws of the society that are made or enacted after the certificate is issued are binding on the owner and beneficiaries and govern and control the benefit contract in all respects as if the amendments were made and in force before the time of the application for insurance. An amendment does not destroy or diminish any benefits that the society contracted to give the owner as of the date of issuance.

C. A person on whose life a benefit contract is issued before the person attains the age of majority is bound by the terms of the application.

D. The laws of the society shall provide that if the society's reserves as to any or all classes of certificates become impaired, the board of directors or other corresponding body may require that the owner pay to the society the amount of the owner's equitable proportion of the deficiency as ascertained by the board or other corresponding body. If the payment is not made the payment stands as an indebtedness against the certificate and draws interest in an amount not exceeding the rate specified for certificate loans under the certificate or the owner may accept a proportionate reduction in benefits under the certificate, or both. The society may specify the manner of the election and which alternative is presumed if no election is made.

E. Copies of any documents under this section that are certified by the secretary or other corresponding officer of the society shall be received in evidence on the terms and conditions of those documents.

F. A certificate shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless a copy of the form is filed with and approved by the director in the manner provided for like policies issued by life and disability insurers in this state. Every life, accident and sickness, health or disability insurance certificate and every annuity certificate that is issued on or after January 1, 1996 shall be filed with and approved by the director and shall meet the standard contract provision requirements that are not inconsistent with this title for like policies issued by life and disability insurers in this state. A society may provide a grace period for the payment of premiums of one full month in its certificates. The certificate shall state the amount of premiums that are payable under the certificate and shall recite or prescribe the substance of any of the society's laws or rules in effect at the time of issuance of the certificate that, if violated, will result in the termination of or reduction of benefits payable under the certificate. If the laws or rules of the society provide for the expulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate shall state that a member who is expelled or suspended may maintain the certificate in force by continuing to pay the required premium, unless the member was expelled or suspended for the nonpayment of premium or during the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membership or insurance.

G. Benefit contracts that are issued on the lives of persons who are under the society's minimum age for adult membership may provide for the transfer of control of ownership to the insured at an age specified in the certificate. The society may require that an application for membership be approved in order to effect this transfer and may provide for the regulation, government and control of the certificates and all rights, obligations and liabilities incident to and connected with the certificate. The certificate shall specify ownership rights before the transfer.

H. A society may specify the terms and conditions on which benefit contracts may be assigned.

#### Section 20-879. Nonforfeiture benefits, cash surrender value, certificate loans and other options

A. For certificates that are issued before January 1, 1996, the value of every paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and the amount of any cash surrender value, loan or other option granted shall comply with the applicable provisions of law that were in effect before January 1, 1995.

B. For certificates that are issued on or after January 1, 1996 and for which reserves are computed pursuant to the commissioner's 1941 standard ordinary mortality table, the commissioner's 1941 standard industrial table, the commissioner's 1958 standard ordinary mortality table, the commissioner's 1980 standard mortality table or any other more recent table that is applicable to life insurers, every paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and the amount of any cash surrender value, loan or other option granted shall not be less than the corresponding amount that is ascertained and based on those tables for life insurance policies containing like benefits.

#### Section 20-880. Investments

A society shall invest its funds only in those investments that are authorized by this title. A foreign or alien society that is permitted or seeking to do business in this state and that invests its funds in accordance with the laws of the state, district, territory, country or province in which it is incorporated is deemed to meet the requirements of this section for the investment of funds.

#### Section 20-881. Funds

A. Unless otherwise provided in the benefit contract, all assets shall be held, invested and disbursed for the use and benefit of the society, and no member or beneficiary has any individual rights in the assets and is not entitled to any apportionment on the surrender of any part of the assets.

B. A society may create, maintain, invest, disburse and apply any special fund or funds necessary to carry out any purpose permitted by the laws of the society.

C. Pursuant to a resolution of the supreme governing body, a society may establish and maintain one or more separate accounts and issue contracts on a variable basis, subject to the provisions of this title regulating life insurers. To the extent that the society deems it necessary in order to comply with any applicable federal or state law, the society may:

1. Adopt special procedures for the conduct of the business and affairs of a separate account.

2. For persons who have beneficial interests in a separate account, provide special voting and other rights, including, without limitation, special rights and procedures relating to investment policy, investment advisory services, selection of certified public accountants and selection of a committee to manage the business and affairs of the account.

3. Issue contracts on a variable basis. Section 20-878, subsections B and D do not apply to these contracts.

#### Section 20-890. Licensing of insurance producers

A. An insurance producer of a society or its subsidiary or affiliated organizations shall be licensed pursuant to chapter 2, article 3 of this title.  The director may waive the examination for licensure if the applicant was licensed after January 1, 1955 and has been an active soliciting representative of a society in this state for not less than six months immediately preceding the application.

B. A regular salaried officer, employee or member of a licensed society who devotes substantially all of that individual's services to activities other than the solicitation of fraternal insurance contracts and who receives for the solicitation of those contracts no commission or other compensation directly dependent on the amount of business solicited is not subject to examination and licensure pursuant to this section.

This policy is issued by an association or order that does not possess a certificate of authority from the director of the Arizona department of insurance and financial institutions.  If the association or order that issued this policy becomes insolvent, members or claimants will not be eligible for insurance guaranty fund protection pursuant to title 20, Arizona Revised Statutes.

2. The director may require an association or order to file financial statements on a quarterly basis and may require an association or order to file financial statements on other than an annual or quarterly basis due to factors or trends affecting insurers writing a particular class or classes of business or because of changes in the management or financial or operating condition of the association or order.

#### Section 20-1110. Approval of forms; definition

B. This section shall not apply to policies, riders, endorsements or forms of unique character designed and used for insurance on a particular subject, or that relate to the manner of distribution of benefits or to the reservation of rights and benefits under life or disability insurance policies, and are used at the request of the individual policyholder, contract holder or certificate holder.

C. Every form filing shall be made not less than thirty days in advance of any delivery.  The form is approved thirty days after filing unless the director, within the thirty day period, has issued an order affirmatively approving or disapproving the form. The director may extend by not more than an additional fifteen days the period for review of the form, by giving notice of the extension before expiration of the initial thirty day period. The director may at any time, after notice and for cause shown, withdraw the director's approval. This subsection also applies to contracts and policy forms filed with the department under section 20-826, subsection A by a corporation holding a certificate of authority under chapter 4, article 3 of this title.

If the director finds that the advertising matter or sales material, in whole or in part, is false, deceptive or misleading, the director may issue an order disapproving the advertising matter or sales material, directing the life or disability insurer to cease and desist from issuing, circulating, displaying or using the advertising matter or sales material within a period of time specified by the director but not less than ten days and imposing any penalties prescribed in this title.  At least five days before issuing an order pursuant to this subsection, the director shall provide the life or disability insurer with a written notice of the basis of the order to provide the life or disability insurer with an opportunity to cure the alleged deficiency in the advertising matter or sales material within a single five day period for the particular advertising matter or sales material at issue. The life or disability insurer may appeal the director's order pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a life or disability insurer may obtain a stay of the effectiveness of the order as prescribed in section 20-162. If the director certifies in the order and provides a detailed explanation of the reasons in support of the certification that continued use of the advertising matter or sales material poses a threat to the health, safety or welfare of the public, the order may be entered immediately without opportunity for cure and the effectiveness of the order is not stayed pending the hearing on the notice of appeal but the hearing shall be promptly instituted and determined. 

F. The director, by order, may exempt from the requirements of this section for so long as the director deems proper any insurance document, advertisement or form as specified in the order, to which, in the director's opinion, this section may not practicably be applied, or the filing and approval of which are, in the director's opinion, not desirable or necessary for the protection of the public.

G.

C. In any life or disability insurance policy issued upon the life of a spouse, the designation made by such spouse of a beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the policy shall create a presumption that the beneficiary was so designated with the consent of the other spouse, but only as to any beneficiary who is the child, grandchild, parent, brother or sister of either of the spouses. The insurer may in good faith rely upon the representations made by the insured as to the relationship to him of any such beneficiary.

Subject to the statute of limitations, the amount of any premiums for insurance paid in fraud of creditors, with interest, shall inure to their benefit from the proceeds of the policy, but the insurer issuing the policy shall be discharged of all liability on the policy by payment of the proceeds in accordance with its terms, unless before payment the insurer received written notice by or in behalf of some creditor, with specification of the amount claimed, claiming to recover for certain premiums paid in fraud of creditors.

C. For the purposes of subsection A, a policy shall also be deemed to be payable to a person other than the insured if and to the extent that a facility-of-payment clause or similar clause in the policy permits the insurer to discharge its obligation after the death of the individual insured by paying the death benefits to a person as permitted by the clause.

A medicare supplement insurance policy may not contain any exclusion for services provided by any type of properly licensed health care provider if the provider's services are eligible for medicare reimbursement and if the specific services in question would be covered by medicare. The scope of benefits of a medicare supplement policy may not be less than the minimum level of benefits established by federal law.

#### Section 20-1136. Accelerated payments of certain benefits in life insurance policies

#### Section 20-1204. Incontestability

There shall be a provision in participating policies that, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year, the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion the divisible surplus, if any, that will accrue on the policy anniversary or other dividend date specified in the policy provided the policy is in force and all premiums to that date are paid. Except as provided in this section, any dividend so apportioned shall, at the option of the party entitled to elect such option, be either payable in cash or applied to any one of such other dividend options as may be provided by the policy. If any such other dividend options are provided, the policy shall further state which option shall be automatically effective if the party has not elected some other option. If the policy specifies a period within which the other dividend option may be elected, such period shall be not less than thirty days following the date on which the dividend is due and payable. The annually apportioned dividend shall be deemed to be payable in cash even though the policy provides that payment of the dividend is to be deferred for a specified period, but such period shall not exceed six years from the date of apportionment and interest shall be added to the dividend at a specified rate. If a participating policy provides that the benefit under any paid-up nonforfeiture provision is to be participating, it may provide that any divisible surplus apportioned while the insurance is in force under the nonforfeiture provision shall be applied in the manner set forth in the policy.

A. In the case of policies issued prior to the operative date of section 20-1231, there shall be a provision that after three full years premiums have been paid, the insurer at any time while the policy is in force will advance on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security thereof at a specified rate of interest not to exceed six per cent per annum, an amount equal to, or at the option of the owner of the policy less than, the reserve at the end of the current policy year on the policy and on any dividend addition thereto, computed according to any mortality table, rate of interest and the method of valuation permitted by the provisions of this title, the policy specifying the mortality table and rate of interest adopted for computing such reserve, less an amount not more than two and one-half per cent of the amount insured by the policy and of any dividend additions thereto, and that the insurer shall deduct from such loan value any existing indebtedness on the policy and any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year, and may collect interest in advance on the loan to the end of the current policy year. An insurer may, in lieu of the provisions permitted by this section for the deduction from a loan on the policy of an amount not more than two and one-half per cent of the amount insured by the policy and of any dividend additions thereto, insert in the policy a provision that one fifth of the entire reserve may be deducted in case of a loan under the policy, or may provide therein that the deduction may be the two and one-half per cent or the one fifth of the entire reserve at the option of the insurer. The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for six months after application therefor is made. The policy, at the insurer's option, may provide for an automatic premium loan, subject to an election of the party entitled to elect.

B. The provision provided for in subsection A of this section shall not be required in term insurance, nor shall it apply to temporary insurance or pure endowment insurance, issued or granted in exchange for lapsed or surrendered policies.

In case of policies issued on and after January 1, 1979, there shall be a provision that after the policy has a cash surrender value and while no premium is in default beyond the grace period for payment, the insurer will advance, on proper assignment or pledge of the policy and on the sole security of such policy, at a specified rate of interest, an amount equal to or, at the option of the party entitled thereto, less than the loan value of the policy. The loan value of the policy shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, provided that the insurer may deduct, either from the loan value or from the proceeds of the loan, any existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining the cash surrender value including any interest then accrued but not due, any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year. The policy may also provide that if interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due it shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate, and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value the policy shall terminate and become void. The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for six months after application. The policy, at the insurer's option, may provide for an automatic premium loan, subject to an election of the party entitled to elect.

B. This section shall not apply to term policies nor to term insurance benefits provided by rider or supplemented policy provision.

E. The life insurer shall:

A. This section may be cited as the standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance.

B. Nonforfeiture provisions--Life. In the case of policies issued on or after the operative date of this section as defined in subsection J of this section, no policy of life insurance, except as set forth in subsection I of this section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are the minimum requirements specified in this section and are essentially in compliance with subsection H of this section:

1. That in the event of default in any premium payment, the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as is specified by this section.  Instead of the stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.

2. That upon surrender of the policy within sixty days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of ordinary insurance, and five full years in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as is specified by this section.

3. That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default.

4. That if the policy has become paid up by completion of all premiums payments, or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance, or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within thirty days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as is specified by this section.

5. In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy. In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary, either during the first twenty policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.

6. A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of this state, an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy, if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered, and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.

C. Any of the provisions or portions of the provisions set forth in subsection B, paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section which are not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy. The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.

D. Cash surrender value--Life.

1. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in the premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by subsection B of this section, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value on such anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions if there had been no default, over the sum of the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsection F of this section and in section 20-1231.01, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary, and the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.

2. For any policy issued on or after the operative date as provided in section 20-1231.01 which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph 1 of this subsection is in an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.

3. For any family policy issued on or after the operative date as provided in section 20-1231.01 which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age seventy-one, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph 1 of this subsection is in an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in that paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in that paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by term insurance on the life of the spouse.

4. Any cash surrender value available within thirty days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments, or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, whether or not required by subsection B of this section, shall be an amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.

E. Paid-up nonforfeiture benefits--Life. Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in the premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of such anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy, or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this section in the absence of the conditions that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.

F. The adjusted premiums--Life.

1. Paragraphs 1 through 4 and paragraph 5, subdivision (a) of this subsection do not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date as provided in section 20-1231.01. Except as provided in paragraph 3 of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:

(a) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.

(b) Two per cent of the amount of the insurance if the insurance is uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as defined by this section, if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy.

(c) Forty per cent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year.

(d) Twenty-five per cent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less.

2. In applying the percentages specified in subdivisions (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 of this subsection, no adjusted premiums shall be deemed to exceed four per cent of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto.  When the plan or term of a policy has been changed, either by request of the insured or automatically in accordance with the provisions of the policy, the date of inception of the changed policy for the purposes of determining a nonforfeiture benefit or cash surrender value shall be the date as of which the age of the insured is determined for the purposes of the changed policy.

3. The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provisions shall be equal to the sum of:

(a) The adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits.

(b) The adjusted premiums for such term insurance benefits during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable.  Such subdivisions (a) and (b) shall be calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection except that, for the purposes of subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 of this subsection, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in this subdivision shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in subdivision (a) of this paragraph.

4. In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with the duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection shall be deemed to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy, but in the case of a policy for a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten were the amount provided by the policy at age ten.

5. Tables for calculating adjusted premiums shall be as follows:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (b) and (d) of this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1941 standard ordinary mortality table provided that, for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not in excess of three years younger than the actual age of the insured. Such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 standard industrial mortality table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and one-half per cent per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, but in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than one hundred thirty per cent of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.

(b) This subdivision does not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date as provided in section 20-1231.01. In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date defined in subdivision (c) of this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1958 standard ordinary mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half per cent per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding four per cent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1974 and prior to January 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after January 1, 1979, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent per annum may be used, and provided that:

(i) For any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not in excess of six years younger than the actual age of the insured.

(ii) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not in excess of those shown in the commissioners 1958 extended term insurance table.

(iii) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.

(c) Any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of subdivision (b) of this paragraph, either as to designated ordinary policies or as to all ordinary policies issued by it, after a specified date before January 1, 1966. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date of such subdivision (b) as to such policies for such insurer, such subdivision (b) shall become operative with respect to such policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, or so elects to have such subdivision (b) apply as to certain of its ordinary policies only, the operative date thereof as to all of the ordinary policies issued by such insurer, other than those policies as to which the insurer has elected an earlier operative date, shall be January 1, 1966.

(d) This subdivision does not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date provided in section 20-1231.01. In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this subdivision as defined herein, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subdivision shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half per cent per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding four per cent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1974 and prior to January 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after January 1, 1979, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent per annum may be used. But, in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table and, for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculations of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.  After the effective date of this subdivision, an insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subdivision, either as to designated industrial policies or as to all industrial policies issued by it, after a specified date before January 1, 1968. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date of this subdivision for such insurer, this subdivision shall become operative with respect to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subdivision for such insurer shall be January 1, 1968.

(e) For any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or for any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsection B, C, D or E of this section, paragraph 1 of this subsection, subdivision (b), (c) or (d) of this paragraph or section 20-1231.01, then:

(i) The director must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsection B, C, D or E of this section, paragraph 1 of this subsection, subdivision (b), (c) or (d) of this paragraph or section 20-1231.01.

(ii) The director must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of the plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds.

(iii) The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by the plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance, as determined by rules adopted by the director.

G. Calculation of values--Life.

1. Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in subsections D, E and F of this section and section 20-1231.01 may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions.

2. Notwithstanding such provisions of subsection D of this section, additional benefits payable and premiums for all such additional benefits shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits:

(a) In the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means.

(b) In the event of total and permanent disability.

(c) As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits.

(d) As term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply.

(e) As term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child's age is twenty-six, is uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid-up by reason of the death of a parent of the child.

(f) As other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits.

H. This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this section, applies to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986:

1. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of:

(a) The greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified.

(b) The present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy.

2. The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary, except that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection D or F of this section, whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection D or F of this section, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.

3. The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection F of this section or section 20-1231.01, whichever is applicable.  Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, such percentage:

(a) Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the latter of:

(i) The fifth policy anniversary.

(ii) The first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years.

(b) Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in subdivision (a) may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years.

4. No basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection F of this section or section 20-1231.01, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.

5. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections of this section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.

6. Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections B, C, D, E and G of this section and section 20-1231.01. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed in subsection G, paragraph 2 of this section shall conform with the principles of this subsection.

I. Exceptions. This section and section 20-1231.01 do not apply to any of the following:

1. Reinsurance.

2. Group insurance.

3. Pure endowment.

4. Annuity or reversionary annuity contract.

5. A term policy of uniform amount which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy.

6. A term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in subsection F of this section and section 20-1231.01, is less than the adjusted premiums so calculated on a term policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy.

7. Any policy which is delivered outside this state through an insurance producer or other representative of the insurer issuing the policy.

8. A policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in subsections D, E and F of this section and section 20-1231.01, exceeds two and one-half per cent of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year. For the purposes of determining the applicability of this section, the age at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy is the age at expiry of the oldest life.

J. Operative date. Except as is otherwise provided in subsection F of this section, after January 1, 1955, any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before July 1, 1956. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date for such insurer, this section shall become operative with respect to the policies thereafter issued by the insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this section for the insurer shall be July 1, 1956.

 

 

#### Section 20-1231.01. Standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance; table for calculating adjusted premiums; definitions

A. Except as provided in paragraph 7 of this section, on a policy issued on or after the operative date as provided in this section:

1. The adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such a uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:

(a) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.

(b) One per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years.

(c) One hundred twenty-five per cent of the nonforfeiture net level premium. In applying the percentage specified in subdivision (c) of this paragraph no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed four per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section is the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.

2. The nonforfeiture net level premium is equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due.

3. In the case of policies that cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or that provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of such a change in the benefits or premiums, the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.

4. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 of this section, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy are the uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of the sum of the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and the additional expense allowance, if any, over the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.

5. The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, is the sum of:

(a) One per cent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy.

(b) One hundred twenty-five per cent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.

6. The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium is equal to the result obtained by dividing (a) by (b) where:

(a) (a) equals the sum of:

(i) The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred.

(ii) The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.

(b) (b) equals the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.

7. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis that provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, the policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis that provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for the substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.

8. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of either the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table, or at the election of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with ten year select mortality factors, for all policies of industrial insurance, be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table, and for all policies issued in a particular calendar year, be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate for policies issued in that calendar year. However:

(a) At the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as prescribed in this section, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.

(b) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by section 20-1231, subsection B, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any.

(c) An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.

(d) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table for policies of industrial insurance.

(e) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the tables prescribed in this section and section 20-1231.

(f) For policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten year select mortality factors or for the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table.  For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year select mortality factors or for the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table. If the director approves by rule any commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.

(g) For policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, any industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table.  For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table.  If the director approves by rule any commissioners standard industrial mortality table adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.

9. The nonforfeiture interest rate is as follows:

(a) For policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five per cent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in the standard valuation law, rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one per cent.

(b) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.

10. Notwithstanding any other provision in this title, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form that involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.

11. After July 24, 1982 any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which is the operative date of this section for the insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this section for the insurer is January 1, 1989.

B. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Operative date of the valuation manual" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-510, subsection R, paragraph 2.

2. "Valuation manual" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-510, subsection B.

 

#### Section 20-1232. Standard nonforfeiture law for individual deferred annuities

A. A contract of annuity, except as stated in subsection K of this section, shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless the contract contains in substance the following provisions or corresponding provisions that in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the contract holder on cessation of payment of considerations under the contract:

1. That on cessation of payment of considerations under a contract, or on the written request of the contract owner, the company shall grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in subsections D, E, F, G and I of this section.

2. If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that on surrender of the contract at or before the commencement of any annuity payments, the company shall pay in lieu of a paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit of such an amount as is specified in subsections D, E, G and I of this section.  The company, within thirty days of the date of maturity as prescribed in the contract, shall notify the annuity owner of the owner’s rights under the contract at the time of maturity of the contract, including the right to receive the cash value benefit in a lump sum, if applicable.  The company shall pay any amounts due under the contract within thirty days after the date the amount becomes payable.  The company may reserve the right to defer the payment of the cash surrender benefit for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty days after demand for such a cash surrender benefit with surrender of the contract after making written request and receiving written approval from the director.  The annuity owner shall be notified within fifteen days after the date that any request for withdrawal is received that the company has requested a deferral pursuant to this paragraph. In making its request to the director, the company shall address the necessity and equitability to all policyholders of the deferral and the reason why payment cannot take place within the time period required under this paragraph after the date the annuity benefit becomes due. Any transfer of monies to another annuity company designated by the contract owner pursuant to section 1035 of the internal revenue code shall take place within thirty days after all required forms relating to the transfer are filed with the original annuity company.

3. A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of the benefits.

4. A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which the benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract, any indebtedness to the company on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.

B. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection A of this section, a deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from prior considerations paid would be less than $20 monthly, the company, at its option, may terminate the contract by payment in cash of the then present value of the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis on the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by this payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under the contract.

C. The minimum values as specified in subsections D, E, F, G and I of this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based on minimum nonforfeiture amounts prescribed as follows:

1. The minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or before the commencement of any annuity payments is equal to an accumulation up to that time at rates of interest, as prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection, of the net considerations paid before that time, decreased by the sum of all of the following:

(a) Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at rates of interest as prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

(b) An annual contract charge of $50, accumulated at rates of interest as prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

(c) Any premium tax paid by the company for the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

(d) The amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount is an amount equal to eighty-seven and one-half percent of the gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year.

2. The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts is an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent per annum and the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset:

(a) The five-year constant maturity treasury rate reported by the federal reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest one-twentieth of one percent, specified in the contract not longer than fifteen months before the contract issue date or redetermination date under subdivision (d) of this paragraph.

(b) Reduced by one hundred twenty-five basis points.

(c) Where the resulting interest rate is not less than fifteen-hundredths of one percent.

(d) The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods.  The redetermination date, basis and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract.  The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five-year constant maturity treasury rate to be used at each redetermination date.

3. During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in paragraph 2, subdivision (b) of this subsection by up to an additional one hundred basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit.  The present value at the contract issue date, and at each redetermination date thereafter, of the additional reduction shall not exceed the market value of the benefit. The director may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit.  Lacking such a demonstration that is acceptable to the director, the director may disallow or limit the additional reduction.

4. The director may adopt rules to implement paragraph 3 of this subsection and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit and for other contracts where the director determines that adjustments are justified.

D. Any paid-up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date. The present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract.

E. For contracts that provide cash surrender benefits, the cash surrender benefits available before maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit that would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, the present value being calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than one percent higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine maturity value, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. Any cash surrender benefit shall not be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under such contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.

F. For contracts that do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time before maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid before the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, the present value being calculated for the period before the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine maturity value and increased by any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract.  For contracts that do not provide any death benefits before the commencement of any annuity payments, the present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit. However, the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit shall not be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.

G. For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under subsections E and F of this section, in the case of annuity contracts under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be deemed to be the latest date for which election shall be allowed by the contract, but shall not be deemed to be later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant's seventieth birthday or the tenth anniversary of the contract, whichever is later.

H. Any contract that does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount before the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided.

I. Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs.

J. For a contract that provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections D, E, F, G and I of this section, additional benefits payable in the event of total and permanent disability, as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits or as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and considerations for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section. The inclusion of such additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless the additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.

K. This section shall not apply to any reinsurance, group annuity purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the internal revenue code, as now or hereafter amended, premium deposit fund, variable annuity, investment annuity, immediate annuity, any deferred annuity contract after annuity payments have commenced, or reversionary annuity, nor to any contract that shall be delivered outside this state through an insurance producer or other representative of the company issuing the contract.

Each annuity contract delivered or issued for delivery in this state and each annuity application shall contain a notice prominently printed on or attached to the first page stating that, on written request, an insurer is required to provide within a reasonable time reasonable factual information regarding the benefits and provisions of the annuity contract to the contract holder and that if for any reason the contract holder is not satisfied with the annuity contract the contract holder may return the annuity contract within ten days, or within thirty days if the contract holder is sixty-five years of age or older on the date of the application for the annuity contract, after the contract is delivered and receive a refund of all monies paid.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A, for variable annuity contracts, the refund under subsection A shall equal the sum of the difference between the premiums paid, including any policy or contract fees or other charges, and the amounts allocated to any separate accounts under the policy or contract, and the value of the amounts allocated to any separate accounts under the policy or contract on the date the returned policy is received by the insurer or its insurance producer.

C. The ten or thirty day return and refund provision provided in subsection A does not apply to an annuity contract supplemental to a settled annuity contract that provides for payments in consideration of accumulations from the original annuity contract and that is issued only to holders of the original contract.

#### Section 20-1243.03. Duties of insurers and producers; definitions

A. When a producer makes a recommendation of an annuity, the producer shall act in the best interest of the consumer under the circumstances known at the time the recommendation is made, without placing the producer's or the insurer's financial interest ahead of the consumer's interest.  The producer has acted in the best interest of the consumer if the producer has satisfied the obligations regarding care, disclosure, conflict of interest and documentation prescribed in this section.

B. To satisfy the care obligation, in making a recommendation, the producer shall exercise reasonable diligence, care and skill to do all of the following:

1. Know the consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives.

2. Understand the available recommendation options after making a reasonable inquiry into options available to the producer.

3. Have a reasonable basis to believe both of the following:

(a) The recommended option effectively addresses the consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives over the life of the product, as evaluated in light of the consumer profile information.

(b) The consumer would benefit from certain features of the annuity, such as annuitization, death or living benefits or other insurance-related features.

4. Communicate the basis or bases of the recommendation.

5. Make reasonable efforts to obtain consumer profile information from the consumer before the recommendation of an annuity.

6. Consider the types of products the producer is authorized and licensed to recommend or sell that address the consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives.  The producer:

(a) Is not required to analyze or consider any product outside the producer's authority and license or other possible alternative products or strategies that are available in the market at the time of recommendation.

(b) Shall be held to standards that apply to producers with similar authority and licensure.

7. In the case of an exchange or replacement of an annuity, consider the whole transaction, including taking into consideration whether:

(a) The consumer will incur a surrender charge, be subject to the commencement of a new surrender period, lose existing benefits, such as death, living or other contractual benefits, or be subject to increased fees, investment advisory fees or charges for riders and similar product enhancements.

(b) The replacing product would substantially benefit the consumer in comparison to the replaced product over the life of the product.

(c) The consumer has had another annuity exchange or replacement and, in particular, an exchange or replacement within the preceding sixty months.

C. The requirements under the best interest and care obligations under subsections A and B of this section do not create a fiduciary obligation or relationship and only create a regulatory obligation as established in this article.

D. The requirements under the care obligation under subsection B of this section:

1. Apply to the particular annuity as a whole and the underlying subaccounts to which funds are allocated at the time of purchase or exchange of an annuity, and riders and similar product enhancements, if any.

2. Do not mean the annuity with the lowest onetime or multiple occurrence compensation structure shall necessarily be recommended.

3. Do not mean the producer has ongoing monitoring obligations under the care obligation under subsection B of this section, although such an obligation may be separately owed under the terms of a fiduciary, consulting, investment advising or financial planning agreement between the consumer and the producer.

4. Do not require a producer to obtain any license other than a producer license with the appropriate line of authority to sell, solicit or negotiate insurance in this state, including any securities license, in order to fulfill the duties and obligations contained in this article if the producer does not give advice or provide services that are otherwise subject to securities laws or engage in any other activity requiring other professional licenses.

E. Under the care obligation under subsection B of this section, the consumer profile information, characteristics of the insurer and product costs, rates, benefits and features are those factors generally relevant in making a determination whether an annuity effectively addresses the consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives, but the level of importance of each factor under the care obligation under subsection B of this section may vary depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, and each factor may not be considered in isolation.

F. To satisfy the disclosure obligation, before the recommendation or sale of an annuity, the producer shall prominently disclose the following information to the consumer on a form substantially similar to the "insurance agent (producer) disclosure for annuities" form in appendix A of the 2020 national association of insurance commissioners suitability in annuity transactions model regulation:

1. A description of the scope and terms of the relationship with the consumer and the role of the producer in the transaction.

2. An affirmative statement on whether the producer is licensed and authorized to sell the following products:

(a) Fixed annuities.

(b) Fixed indexed annuities.

(c) Variable annuities.

(d) Life insurance.

(e) Mutual funds.

(f) Stocks and bonds.

(g) Certificates of deposit.

4. A description of the sources and types of cash compensation and noncash compensation to be received by the producer, including whether the producer is to be compensated for the sale of a recommended annuity by commission as part of a premium or other remuneration received from the insurer, intermediary or other producer or by fee as a result of a contract for advice or consulting services.

5. A notice of the consumer's right to request additional information regarding cash compensation.  On request of the consumer or the consumer's designated representative, the producer shall disclose both of the following:

(a) A reasonable estimate of the amount of cash compensation to be received by the producer, which may be stated as a range of amounts or percentages.

(b) Whether the cash compensation is a onetime or multiple occurrence amount and, if a multiple occurrence amount, the frequency and amount of the occurrence, which may be stated as a range of amounts or percentages.

G. The disclosure obligation under subsection F of this section requires that before or at the time of the recommendation or sale of an annuity, the producer shall have a reasonable basis to believe the consumer has been informed of various features of the annuity, such as the potential surrender period and surrender charge, potential tax penalty if the consumer sells, exchanges, surrenders or annuitizes the annuity, mortality and expense fees, investment advisory fees, any annual fees, potential charges for and features of riders or other options of the annuity, limits on interest returns, potential changes in nonguaranteed elements of the annuity, insurance and investment components and market risk.

H. To satisfy the conflict of interest obligation, the producer shall identify and avoid or reasonably manage and disclose material conflicts of interest, including material conflicts of interest related to an ownership interest.

I. To satisfy the documentation obligation, the producer at the time of recommendation or sale shall:

1. Make a written record of any recommendation and the basis for the recommendation subject to this article.

2. Obtain a consumer-signed statement on a form substantially similar to the "consumer refusal to provide information" form in appendix B of the 2020 national association of insurance commissioners suitability in annuity transactions model regulation documenting both:

(a) A customer's refusal to provide the consumer profile information, if any.

(b) A customer's understanding of the ramifications of not providing the consumer profile information or providing insufficient consumer profile information.

3. Obtain a consumer-signed statement on a form substantially similar to the "consumer decision to purchase an annuity not based on a recommendation" form in appendix C of the 2020 national association of insurance commissioners suitability in annuity transactions model regulation acknowledging the annuity transaction is not recommended if a customer decides to enter into an annuity transaction that is not based on the producer's recommendation.

J. Any requirement applicable to a producer under subsections A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I of this section applies to every producer who has exercised material control or influence in the making of a recommendation and has received direct compensation as a result of the recommendation or sale, regardless of whether the producer has had any direct contact with the consumer. Activities such as the following do not in and of themselves constitute material control or influence:

1. Providing or delivering marketing or educational material.

2. Product wholesaling or other back-office product support.

3. General supervision of a producer.

K. An insurer's issuance of an annuity subject to this subsection shall be reasonable under all the circumstances actually known to the insurer at the time the annuity is issued.  A producer has no other obligation under subsections A, B, C, D and E of this section to a consumer related to an annuity transaction if:

1. No recommendation is made.

2. A recommendation was made that was later found to have been prepared based on materially inaccurate information provided by the consumer.

3. The consumer refuses to provide relevant consumer profile information and the annuity transaction is not recommended.

4. The consumer decides to enter into an annuity transaction that is not based on a recommendation by the producer.

L. Except as allowed under this subsection, an insurer may not issue an annuity recommended to a consumer unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the annuity would effectively address the particular consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives based on the consumer's consumer profile information.  Each insurer shall establish and maintain a supervision system that is reasonably designed to achieve the insurer's and its producers' compliance with this article and that includes the following:

1. Reasonable procedures to inform its producers of the requirements of this article, including incorporating the requirements of this article in relevant producer training manuals.

2. Standards for producer product training, including establishing and maintaining reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with section 20-1243.07.

3. Product-specific training and training materials that explain all material features of its annuity products to its producers.

4. Procedures for reviewing each recommendation before issuing an annuity that are designed to ensure there is a reasonable basis to determine that the recommended annuity would effectively address the particular consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives.  The review procedures may apply a screening system for the purpose of identifying selected transactions for additional review and may be accomplished electronically or through other means, including physical review. The electronic system or other system may be designed to require additional review of only those transactions that are identified for additional review by the selection criteria.

5. Reasonable procedures to detect recommendations that do not comply with subsections A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, O and P of this section, including confirmation of the consumer's consumer profile information, systematic customer surveys, producer and consumer interviews, confirmation letters, producer statements or attestations and programs of internal monitoring. This paragraph does not prevent an insurer from complying with this paragraph by applying sampling procedures or by confirming the consumer profile information or other required information under this section after issuing or delivering the annuity.

6. Reasonable procedures to assess, before or on issuance or delivery of an annuity, whether a producer has provided to the consumer the information required to be provided under this section.

7. Reasonable procedures to identify and address suspicious consumer refusals to provide consumer profile information.

8. Reasonable procedures to identify and eliminate any sales contests, sales quotas, bonuses and noncash compensation that are based on the sales of specific annuities within a limited period of time.  This paragraph does not prohibit the receipt of health insurance, office rent, office support, retirement benefits or other employee benefits by employees so long as those benefits are not based on the volume of sales of a specific annuity within a limited period of time.

9. A written annual report to senior management, including to the senior manager responsible for audit functions, that details a review with appropriate testing and that is reasonably designed to determine the effectiveness of the supervision system, the exceptions found and corrective action taken or recommended, if any.

M. An insurer may contract for performance of a function, including maintenance of procedures, required under subsection L of this section but is responsible for taking appropriate corrective action and may be subject to sanctions and penalties pursuant to section 20-1243.05 regardless of whether the insurer contracts for performance of a function and regardless of the insurer's compliance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection.  An insurer's supervision system under this subsection shall include supervision of contractual performance under this subsection by incorporating at least both of the following:

1. Monitoring and, as appropriate, conducting audits to ensure that the contracted function is properly performed.

2. Annually obtaining a certification from a senior manager who has responsibility for the contracted function that the manager has a reasonable basis to represent, and does represent, that the function is properly performed.

N. An insurer is not required to include in its system of supervision:

1. A producer's recommendations to consumers of products other than the annuities offered by the insurer.

2. Consideration of or comparison to options available to the producer or compensation relating to those options other than annuities or other products offered by the insurer.

O. A producer or an insurer may not dissuade, or attempt to dissuade, a consumer from:

1. Truthfully responding to an insurer's request for confirmation of the consumer profile information.

2. Filing a complaint.

3. Cooperating with the investigation of a complaint.

P. Recommendations and sales of annuities that comply with comparable standards satisfy the requirements under this article. This subsection applies to all recommendations and sales of annuities made by financial professionals in compliance with business rules, controls and procedures that satisfy a comparable standard even if such a standard would not otherwise apply to the product or recommendation at issue.  This subsection does not limit the director's ability to investigate and enforce this article or limit the insurer's obligation to comply with its obligation under subsection L of this section not to issue an annuity recommended to a consumer unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the annuity would effectively address the particular consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives based on the consumer's consumer profile information, although the insurer may base its analysis on information received from either the financial professional or the entity supervising the financial professional.  An insurer complies with this subsection if the insurer does all of the following:

1. Monitors the relevant conduct of the financial professional seeking to rely on this subsection or the entity responsible for supervising the financial professional, such as the financial professional's broker-dealer or an investment adviser registered under federal or state securities laws using information collected in the normal course of an insurer's business.

2. Provides to the entity responsible for supervising the financial professional seeking to rely on this subsection, such as the financial professional's broker-dealer or investment adviser registered under federal or state securities laws, information and reports that are reasonably appropriate to assist the entity to maintain its supervision system.

Q. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Comparable standards" means:

(a) With respect to broker-dealers and registered representatives of broker-dealers, applicable SEC and FINRA rules relating to best interest obligations and supervision of annuity recommendations and sales, including regulation best interest and any amendments or successor regulations.

The policy may provide that the term "debtors" shall include the debtors of one or more subsidiary corporations, and the debtors of one or more affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships if the business of the policyholder and of such affiliated corporations, proprietors or partnerships is under common control through stock ownership, contract or otherwise.

2. The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either from the creditor's funds, or from charges collected from the insured debtors, or from both. A policy on which part or all of the premium is to be derived from the collection from the insured debtors of identifiable charges not required of uninsured debtors shall not include, in the class or classes of debtors eligible for insurance, debtors under obligations outstanding at its date of issue without evidence of individual insurability unless at least seventy-five per cent of the then eligible debtors elect to pay the required charges. A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from the collection of such identifiable charges shall insure all eligible debtors, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.

3. The policy may be issued only if the group of eligible debtors is then receiving new entrants at the rate of at least one hundred persons yearly, or may reasonably be expected to receive at least one hundred new entrants during the first policy year, and only if the policy reserves to the insurer the right to require evidence of individual insurability if less than seventy-five per cent of the new entrants become insured.

4. The amount of insurance on the life of any debtor shall at no time exceed the amount of the unpaid indebtedness.

5. The insurance shall be payable to the policyholder. Such payment shall reduce or extinguish the unpaid indebtedness of the debtor to the extent of such payment.

2. The premium for the policy shall be paid by the policyholder, either from the union's funds, or from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance, or from both.  A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured members specifically for their insurance shall insure all eligible members, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.

2. The premium for the policy shall be paid by the trustees, either from funds contributed by the employer or employers of the insured persons or by the union or unions, or from the insured persons specifically for their insurance, or from both, or, except in the case of a policy issued to the trustees of a fund established wholly by two or more employers, from such funds, or from funds contributed by the insured persons, or from both.  A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by insured persons specifically for their insurance shall insure all eligible persons, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer.

3. The policy shall cover at date of issue at least one hundred persons and not less than an average of five persons, other than individual proprietors or partners, per employer unit.  If the fund is established by the members of an association of employers the policy may be issued only if either the participating employers constitute at date of issue at least sixty per cent of those employer members whose employees are not already covered for group life insurance, or the total number of persons covered at date of issue exceeds six hundred, and if the policy does not require that, if a participating employer discontinues membership in the association, the insurance of his employees shall cease solely by reason of such discontinuance.

1. The individual policy, at the option of such person, is on any one of the forms, except term insurance, then customarily issued by the insurer at the age and for the amount applied for.

2. The individual policy is in an amount not in excess of the amount of life insurance which ceases because of the termination, less, in the case of a person whose membership in the class or classes eligible for coverage terminates but who continues in employment in another class, the amount of any life insurance for which the person is or becomes eligible under any other group policy within thirty-one days after the termination, provided that any amount of insurance which has matured on or before the date of the termination as an endowment payable to the person insured, whether in one sum or in installments or in the form of an annuity, shall not, for the purposes of this provision, be included in the amount which is considered to cease because of the termination.

#### Section 20-1268. Death pending conversion

In group life policies there shall be a provision that if a person insured under the group policy dies during the period within which he would have been entitled to have an individual policy issued to him in accordance with sections 20-1266 or 20-1267 and before such an individual policy becomes effective, the amount of life insurance which he would have been entitled to have issued to him under such individual policy shall be payable as a claim under the group policy, whether or not application for the individual policy or the payment of the first premium therefor has been made.

#### Section 20-1269. Notice of conversion right

If any individual insured under a group life insurance policy delivered after January 1, 1955 in this state becomes entitled under the terms of the policy to have an individual policy of life insurance issued to him without evidence of insurability, subject to the making of application and payment of the first premium within a period specified in the policy, and if the individual is not given notice of the existence of such right at least fifteen days prior to the expiration date of such period, then notwithstanding the terms of the policy the individual shall have an additional period within which to exercise the right.

If the insured changes his occupation to one classified by the insurer as less hazardous than that stated in this policy, the insurer, upon receipt of proof of such change of occupation, will reduce the premium rate accordingly, and will return the excess pro rata unearned premium from the date of change of occupation or from the policy anniversary date immediately preceding receipt of such proof, whichever is the more recent.  In applying this provision, the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be such as have been last filed by the insurer prior to the occurrence of the loss for which the insurer is liable or prior to date of proof of change in occupation with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided at the time this policy was issued; but if such filing was not required, then the classification of occupational risk and the premium rates shall be those last made effective by the insurer in such state prior to the occurrence of the loss or prior to the date of proof of change in occupation."

"Insurance with other insurers: If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on a provision of service basis or on an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability under any expense incurred coverage of this policy shall be for such proportion of the loss as the amount which would otherwise have been payable hereunder plus the total of the like amounts under all such other valid coverages for the same loss of which this insurer had notice bears to the total like amounts under all valid coverages for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premiums paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the amount so determined.  For the purpose of applying this provision when other coverage is on a provision of service basis, the 'like amount' of such other coverage shall be taken as the amount which the services rendered would have cost in the absence of such coverage."

B. If the policy provision set forth in subsection A of this section is included in a policy which also contains the policy provision set out in section 20-1362 there shall be added to the caption of the provision the phrase "--expense incurred benefits." The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "other valid coverage," approved as to form by the director which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, and by hospital or medical service organizations, and to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director. In the absence of such definition the term shall not include group insurance, automobile medical payments insurance, or coverage provided by hospital or medical service organizations or by union welfare plans or employer or employee benefit organizations. For the purpose of applying the policy provision with respect to any insured, any amount of benefit provided for the insured pursuant to any compulsory benefit statute, including any workers' compensation or employer's liability statute, whether provided by a governmental agency or otherwise shall in all cases be deemed to be "other valid coverage" of which the insurer has had notice. In applying the policy provision no third party liability coverage shall be included as "other valid coverage."

#### Section 20-1362. Insurance with other insurers

A. There may be a provision as follows:

"Insurance with other insurers: If there be other valid coverage, not with this insurer, providing benefits for the same loss on other than an expense incurred basis and of which this insurer has not been given written notice prior to the occurrence or commencement of loss, the only liability for such benefits under this policy shall be for such proportion of the indemnities otherwise provided hereunder for such loss as the like indemnities of which the insurer had notice (including the indemnities under this policy) bear to the total amount of all like indemnities for such loss, and for the return of such portion of the premium paid as shall exceed the pro rata portion for the indemnities thus determined."

B. If the provision is included in a policy which also contains the policy provision set out in section 20-1361 there shall be added to the caption of the provision set forth in subsection A of this section the phrase "--other benefits."

B. The policy provision set forth in subsection A of this section may be inserted only in a policy which the insured has the right to continue in force subject to its terms by the timely payment of premiums until at least age fifty or, in the case of a policy issued after age forty-four for at least five years from its date of issue. The insurer may, at its option, include in this provision a definition of "valid loss of time coverage," approved as to form by the director, which definition shall be limited in subject matter to coverage provided by governmental agencies or by organizations subject to regulation by insurance law or by insurance authorities of this or any other state of the United States or any province of Canada, or to any other coverage the inclusion of which may be approved by the director or any combination of such coverages.

In the event of cancellation, the insurer will return promptly the unearned portion of any premium paid. If the insured cancels, the earned premium shall be computed by the use of the short-rate table last filed with the state official having supervision of insurance in the state where the insured resided when the policy was issued.

#### Section 20-1376.05. Telehealth; coverage of health care services; definition

A. All policies issued, delivered or renewed by a disability insurer in this state must provide coverage for health care services that are provided through telehealth if the health care service would be covered were it provided through an in-person encounter between the insured and a health care provider and provided to an insured receiving the service in this state.  The following requirements apply to coverage of telehealth services:

1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a disability insurer may not limit or deny the coverage of health care services provided through telehealth, including ancillary services, and may apply only the same limits or exclusions on a health care service provided through telehealth that are applicable to an in-person encounter for the same health care service, except for procedures or services for which the weight of evidence, based on practice guidelines, peer-reviewed clinical publications or research or recommendations by the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607, determines not to be appropriate to be provided through telehealth.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a disability insurer shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system, whether provided through telehealth using an audio-visual format or in-person care.  A disability insurer shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent in-person behavioral health and substance use disorder services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system if provided through telehealth using an audio-only format. This paragraph does not apply to a telehealth encounter provided through a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the disability insurer.  A disability insurer may not require a health care provider to use a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the disability insurer as a condition of network participation.

3. Before January 1, 2022, a disability insurer shall cover services provided through an audio-only telehealth encounter if that service is reimbursed by medicare or the Arizona health care cost containment system when provided through an audio-only telehealth encounter.  Beginning January 1, 2022, a disability insurer shall cover services provided through an audio-only telehealth encounter if the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607 recommends that the services may appropriately be provided through an audio-only telehealth encounter.

4. A health care provider shall bill for a telehealth encounter using the healthcare common procedure coding system and shall identify whether the telehealth encounter was provided in an audio-only or audio-video format.  To submit a claim for an audio-only service, the health care provider must make telehealth services generally available to patients through the interactive use of audio, video or other electronic media.

5. At the time of the telehealth encounter, the health care provider shall access clinical information and records, if available, that are appropriate to evaluate the patient's condition.  The health care provider shall inform the insured before the telehealth encounter if there is a charge for the encounter.

6. A disability insurer may establish reasonable requirements and parameters for telehealth services, including documentation, fraud prevention, identity verification and recordkeeping, but such requirements and parameters may not be more restrictive or less favorable to health care providers or insureds than are required for health care services delivered in person.

7. Covered telehealth services may be provided regardless of where the insured is located or the type of site.

8. Except in an emergency as prescribed in section 20-2803, the policy may limit the coverage to those health care providers who are members of the disability insurer's provider network.

B. Subsection A of this section does not:

1. Limit the ability of disability insurers to provide incentives to insureds that are designed to improve health outcomes, increase adherence to a course of treatment or reduce risk.

2. Prevent disability insurers from offering network contracts to health care providers that employ value-based purchasing or bundled payment methodologies if otherwise allowed by law or prevent health care providers from voluntarily agreeing to enter into such contracts with a disability insurer.

C. This section does not relieve a disability insurer from an obligation to provide adequate access to in-person health care services.  Network adequacy standards required by federal or state law may not be met by a disability insurer through the use of contracted health care providers who provide only telehealth services and do not provide in-person health care services in this state or within fifty miles of the border of this state.

D. This section does not prevent a disability insurer from imposing deductibles or copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or coinsurance applicable to an in-person encounter for the same health care service. If the disability insurer waives a deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement that impacts a health care provider's contracted reimbursement rate, the disability insurer shall reimburse the health care provider for the cost of the deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement to ensure that the health care provider receives the contracted reimbursement rate if the service is covered and the claim meets other requirements of the network participation agreement.

E. Services provided through telehealth or resulting from a telehealth encounter are subject to all of this state's laws and rules that govern prescribing, dispensing and administering prescription pharmaceuticals and devices and shall comply with Arizona licensure requirements and any practice guidelines of the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607 or, if not addressed, the practice guidelines of a national association of medical professionals promoting access to medical care for consumers via telecommunications technology or other qualified medical professional societies to ensure quality of care.

F. This section does not apply to limited benefit coverage as defined in section 20-1137.

G. For the purposes of this section, "telehealth":

1. Means the interactive use of audio, video or other electronic media, including asynchronous store-and-forward technologies and remote patient monitoring technologies, for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation or treatment.

2. Includes:

(a) The use of an audio-only telephone encounter between an insured who has an existing relationship with a health care provider or provider group if both of the following apply:

(i) An audio-visual telehealth encounter is not reasonably available due to the insured's functional status, the insured's lack of technology or telecommunications infrastructure limits, as determined by the health care provider.

(ii) The telehealth encounter is initiated at the request of the insured or authorized by the insured before the telehealth encounter.

(b) The use of an audio-only encounter between the insured and a health care provider, regardless of whether there is an existing relationship with the health care provider or provider group, if the telehealth encounter is for a behavioral health or substance use disorder service and both items of subdivision (a) of this paragraph apply.

3. Does not include the sole use of a fax machine, instant messages, voice mail or email.

#### Section 20-1376.06. Cancer treatment medications; cost sharing; definition

A. A disability insurance policy that is issued, delivered or renewed by a disability insurer on or after January 1, 2016 and that provides coverage both for cancer treatment medications that are injected or intravenously administered by a health care provider and for patient-administered cancer treatment medications, including medications that are orally administered or self-injected, may not require a higher copayment, deductible or coinsurance amount for patient-administered cancer treatment medications than is required for those cancer treatment medications that are injected or intravenously administered by a health care provider, regardless of the formulation or benefit category.

B. A disability insurer may not increase copayment, deductible or coinsurance amounts for covered cancer treatment medications that are injected or intravenously administered in order to avoid compliance with subsection A of this section, but may increase copayment, deductible or coinsurance amounts for cancer treatment medications if the increase is applied generally to other medical or pharmaceutical benefits under the policy and is not done to circumvent subsection A of this section.

C. A disability insurer may not reclassify benefits with respect to cancer treatment medications in a manner that is inconsistent with this section.

D. For the purposes of this section, "cancer treatment medications" means prescription drugs and biologics that are used to kill, slow or prevent the growth of cancerous cells.

A policy of disability insurance delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall provide for the right of covered family members to continue coverage on the death of the named insured, the entry of a decree of dissolution of marriage of the named insured and any other conditions, other than failure of the insured to pay the required premium, specifically stated in the policy under which coverage would otherwise terminate as to the covered spouse or covered dependent children of the named insured.

B. At the option of the insurer, coverage shall either continue under the existing policy or by the issuance of a converted policy with the person exercising the right to convert designated as the named insured. Coverage provided by a conversion policy must provide benefits most similar to the coverage contained in the policy that was terminated. A person entitled to continuation or conversion rights under this section may elect a lesser form of coverage.

1. The individual has failed to pay premiums or contributions in accordance with the terms of the coverage or the insurer has not received premium payments in a timely manner.

2. The individual has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or the individual made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of the coverage.

3. The insurer has ceased to offer coverage to individuals that is consistent with the requirements of sections 20-1379 and 20-1380.

4. If the insurer offers health care coverage in this state through a network plan, the individual no longer resides, lives or works in the service area served by the network plan or in an area for which the insurer is authorized to transact business but only if the coverage is terminated uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of any covered individual.

5. If the insurer offers health care coverage in this state in the individual market only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of the individual in the association has ceased but only if that coverage is terminated uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of any covered individual.

J.

1. The reservist shall make written application to the insurer within ninety days of discharge from active military duty or within one year of hospitalization continuing after discharge. Coverage shall be effective upon receipt of application by the insurer.

2. The insurer may exclude from such coverage any health or physical condition arising during and occurring as a direct result of active military duty.

M. Each dependent of a person eligible for reinstatement under this section shall be afforded the same rights and be subject to the same conditions as the insured, if the dependent was insured under the individual disability insurance policy at the time the eligible person entered active duty. Any dependent of such person born during the period of active military duty shall have the same rights as other dependents noted in this section.

A.

B. To the extent that payment for covered expenses has been made under the state program pursuant to title XIX of the social security act for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the state is considered to have acquired the rights of the individual to payment by any other party for those health care items or services. On presentation of proof that the state program pursuant to title XIX of the social security act has paid for covered items or services, the insurer shall make payments to the state program pursuant to title XIX of the social security act according to the coverage provided in the disability insurance policy.

C. An insurer issuing disability insurance contracts may not impose on a state agency that has been assigned the rights of an individual who is eligible for medical assistance and who is covered for health benefits from the insurer any requirements that are different from the requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of any other covered individual.

D. An insurer issuing disability insurance contracts shall not cancel or fail to renew the contract of any person based on that person's eligibility for or enrollment in a program funded under title XIX of the social security act or title 36, chapter 29 or 34. Nothing in this section prohibits cancellation or failure to renew for nonpayment of monies due under the contract.

#### Section 20-1379. Guaranteed availability of individual health insurance coverage; prior group coverage; definitions

A. Every health care insurer that offers individual health insurance coverage in the individual market in this state shall provide guaranteed availability of coverage to an eligible individual who desires to enroll in individual health insurance coverage and shall not:

1. Decline to offer that coverage to, or deny enrollment of, that individual.

2. Impose any preexisting condition exclusion for that coverage.

B. Every health care insurer that offers individual health insurance coverage in the individual market in this state shall offer all policy forms of health insurance coverage that are designed for, that are made generally available and actively marketed to and that enroll both eligible or other individuals.  A health care insurer that offers only one policy form in the individual market complies with this section by offering that form to eligible individuals. A health care insurer also may comply with the requirements of this section by electing to offer at least two different policy forms to eligible individuals as provided by subsection C of this section.

C. A health care insurer shall meet the requirements prescribed in subsection B of this section if:

1. The health care insurer offers at least two different policy forms, both of which are designed for, are made generally available and actively marketed to and enroll both eligible and other individuals.

2. The offer includes at least either:

(a) The policy forms with the largest and next to the largest earned premium volume of all policy forms offered by the health care insurer in this state in the individual market during a period not to exceed the preceding two calendar years.

(b) A choice of two policy forms with representative coverage, consisting of a lower level of coverage policy form and a higher level of coverage policy form, each of which includes benefits that are substantially similar to other individual health insurance coverage offered by the health care insurer in this state and each of which is covered by a method that provides for risk adjustment, risk spreading or a risk spreading mechanism among the health care insurer's policies.

D. The health care insurer's election pursuant to subsection C of this section is effective for policies offered during a period of at least two years.

E. If a health care insurer offers individual health insurance coverage in the individual market through a network plan, the health care insurer may do both of the following:

1. Limit the individuals who may be enrolled under health insurance coverage to those who live, reside or work within the service area for a network plan.

2. Within the service area of a network plan, deny health insurance coverage to individuals if the health care insurer has demonstrated, if required, to the director that both:

(a) The health care insurer will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to additional individual enrollees because of the health care insurer's obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees and individual enrollees.

(b) The health care insurer is applying this paragraph uniformly to individuals without regard to any health status-related factor of the individuals and without regard to whether the individuals are eligible individuals.

F. A health care insurer may deny individual health insurance coverage in the individual market to an eligible individual if the health care insurer demonstrates to the director that the health care insurer:

1. Does not have the financial reserves necessary to underwrite additional coverage.

2. Is denying coverage uniformly to all individuals in the individual market in this state pursuant to state law and without regard to any health status-related factor of the individuals and without regard to whether the individuals are eligible individuals.

G. If a health care insurer denies health insurance coverage in this state pursuant to subsection F of this section, the health care insurer shall not offer that coverage in the individual market in this state for one hundred eighty days after the date the coverage is denied or until the health care insurer demonstrates to the director that the health care insurer has sufficient financial reserves to underwrite additional coverage, whichever is later.

H. An accountable health plan as defined in section 20-2301 that offers conversion policies on an individual or group basis in connection with a health benefits plan pursuant to this title is not a health care insurer that offers individual health insurance coverage solely because of the offer of a conversion policy.

I. This section does not:

1. Create additional restrictions on the amount of the premium rates that a health care insurer may charge an individual for health insurance coverage provided in the individual market.

2. Prevent a health care insurer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual market from establishing premium rates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health promotion and disease prevention.

3. Require a health care insurer that offers only short-term limited duration insurance or limited benefit coverage to individuals and no other coverage to individuals in the individual market to offer individual health insurance coverage in the individual market.

4. Require a health care insurer offering health care coverage only on a group basis or through one or more bona fide associations, or both, to offer health insurance coverage in the individual market.

J. A health care insurer shall provide, without charge, a written certificate of creditable coverage as described in this section for creditable coverage occurring after June 30, 1996 if the individual:

1. Ceases to be covered under a policy offered by a health care insurer.  An individual who is covered by a policy that is issued on a group basis by a health care insurer, that is terminated or not renewed at the choice of the sponsor of the group and where the replacement of the coverage is without a break in coverage is not entitled to receive the certification prescribed in this paragraph but is instead entitled to receive the certification prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

2. Requests certification from the health care insurer within twenty-four months after the coverage under a health insurance coverage policy offered by a health care insurer ceases.

K. The certificate of creditable coverage provided by a health care insurer is a written certification of the period of creditable coverage of the individual under the health insurance coverage offered by the health care insurer. The department may enforce and monitor the issuance and delivery of the notices and certificates by health care insurers as required by this section, section 20-1380, the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191; 110 Stat. 1936) and any federal regulations adopted to implement the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996. Notwithstanding any other law, an insurer is not required to provide a certificate of creditable coverage if the federal laws that require providing a certificate of creditable coverage are superseded by the prohibition on preexisting condition exclusions.

L. Any health care insurer, accountable health plan or other entity that issues health care coverage in this state, as applicable, shall issue and accept a certificate of creditable coverage of the individual that contains at least the following information:

1. The date that the certificate is issued.

2. The name of the individual or dependent for whom the certificate applies and any other information that is necessary to allow the issuer providing the coverage specified in the certificate to identify the individual, including the individual's identification number under the policy and the name of the policyholder if the certificate is for or includes a dependent.

3. The name, address and telephone number of the issuer providing the certificate.

4. The telephone number to call for further information regarding the certificate.

5. One of the following:

(a) A statement that the individual has at least eighteen months of creditable coverage. For the purposes of this subdivision, "eighteen months" means five hundred forty-six days.

(b) Both the date that the individual first sought coverage, as evidenced by a substantially complete application, and the date that creditable coverage began.

6. The date creditable coverage ended, unless the certificate indicates that creditable coverage is continuing from the date of the certificate.

7. The consumer assistance telephone number for the department.

8. The following statement in at least fourteen-point type:

Important Notice!

Keep this certificate with your important personal records to protect your rights under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ("HIPAA"). This certificate is proof of your prior health insurance coverage. You may need to show this certificate to have a guaranteed right to buy new health insurance ("Guaranteed issue"). This certificate may also help you avoid waiting periods or exclusions for preexisting conditions. Under HIPAA, these rights are guaranteed only for a very short time period. After your group coverage ends, you must apply for new coverage within 63 days to be protected by HIPAA. If you have questions, call the Arizona department of insurance and financial institutions.

M. A health care insurer has satisfied the certification requirement under this section if the insurer offering the health benefits plan provides the certificate of creditable coverage in accordance with this section within thirty days after the event that triggered the issuance of the certificate.

N. Periods of creditable coverage for an individual are established by the presentation of the certificate described in this section and section 20-2310. In addition to the written certificate of creditable coverage as described in this section, individuals may establish creditable coverage through the presentation of documents or other means.  In order to make a determination that is based on the relevant facts and circumstances of the amount of creditable coverage that an individual has, a health care insurer shall take into account all information that the insurer obtains or that is presented to the insurer on behalf of the individual.

O. A health care insurer shall calculate creditable coverage according to the following rules:

1. The health care insurer shall allow an individual credit for each day the individual was covered by creditable coverage.

2. The health care insurer shall not count a period of creditable coverage for an individual enrolled under any form of health insurance coverage if after the period of coverage and before the enrollment date there were sixty-three consecutive days during which the individual was not covered by any creditable coverage.

3. The health care insurer shall not include any period that an individual is in a waiting period or an affiliation period for any health coverage or is awaiting action by a health care insurer on an application for the issuance of health insurance coverage when the health care insurer determines the continuous period pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection.

4. The health care insurer shall not include any period that an individual is waiting for approval of an application for health care coverage, provided the individual submitted an application to the health care insurer for health care coverage within sixty-three consecutive days after the individual's most recent creditable coverage.

5. The health care insurer shall not count a period of creditable coverage with respect to enrollment of an individual if, after the most recent period of creditable coverage and before the enrollment date, sixty-three consecutive days lapse during all of which the individual was not covered under any creditable coverage. The health care insurer shall not include in the determination of the period of continuous coverage described in this section any period that an individual is in a waiting period for health insurance coverage offered by a health care insurer, is in a waiting period for benefits under a health benefits plan offered by an accountable health plan or is in an affiliation period.

6. In determining the extent to which an individual has satisfied any portion of any applicable preexisting condition period the health care insurer shall count a period of creditable coverage without regard to the specific benefits covered during that period.

P. An individual is an eligible individual if, on the date the individual seeks coverage pursuant to this section, the individual has an aggregate period of creditable coverage as defined and calculated pursuant to this section of at least eighteen months and all of the following apply:

3. The individual satisfies the requirements of an eligible individual as prescribed in this section other than the required period of creditable coverage.

S. If a health care insurer imposes a waiting period for coverage of preexisting conditions, within a reasonable period of time after receiving an individual's proof of creditable coverage and not later than the date by which the individual must select an insurance plan, the health care insurer shall give the individual written disclosure of the insurer's determination regarding any preexisting condition exclusion period that applies to that individual. The disclosure shall include all of the following information:

1. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a group or blanket disability insurer may not limit or deny the coverage of health care services provided through telehealth, including ancillary services, and may apply only the same limits or exclusions on a health care service provided through telehealth that are applicable to an in-person encounter for the same health care service, except for procedures or services for which the weight of evidence, based on practice guidelines, peer-reviewed clinical publications or research or recommendations by the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607, determines not to be appropriate to be provided through telehealth.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a group or blanket disability insurer shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system, whether provided through telehealth using an audio-visual format or in-person care. A group or blanket disability insurer shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent in-person behavioral health and substance use disorder services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system if provided through telehealth using an audio-only format. This paragraph does not apply to a telehealth encounter provided through a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the group or blanket disability insurer.  A group or blanket disability insurer may not require a health care provider to use a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the group or blanket disability insurer as a condition of network participation.

The health care provider shall inform the insured before the telehealth encounter if there is a charge for the encounter.

6.

7. Covered telehealth services may be provided regardless of where the insured is located or the type of site.

8. Except in an emergency as prescribed in section 20-2803, the policy may limit the coverage to those health care providers who are members of the insurer's provider network.

2. Prevent group or blanket disability insurers from offering network contracts to health care providers who employ value-based purchasing or bundled payment methodologies if otherwise allowed by law or prevent health care providers from voluntarily agreeing to enter into such contracts with a group or blanket disability insurer.

D. This section does not prevent a group or blanket disability insurer from imposing deductibles or copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or coinsurance applicable to an in-person encounter for the same health care service.  If the group or blanket disability insurer waives a deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement that impacts a health care provider's contracted reimbursement rate, the group or blanket disability insurer shall reimburse the health care provider for the cost of the deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement to ensure that the health care provider receives the contracted reimbursement rate if the service is covered and the claim meets other requirements of the network participation agreement.

E. Services provided through telehealth or resulting from a telehealth encounter are subject to all of this state's laws and rules that govern prescribing, dispensing and administering prescription pharmaceuticals and devices and shall comply with Arizona licensure requirements and any practice guidelines of the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607 or, if not addressed, the practice guidelines of a national association of medical professionals promoting access to medical care for consumers via telecommunications technology or other qualified medical professional societies to ensure quality of care.

A.

1. Authorized to transact insurance or accredited to assume reinsurance in this state.

The required amount of minimum policyholder position is calculated in the following manner:

1. If the total indebtedness is greater than seventy-five per cent of the value of the collateral property at the date of insurance, the following applies:

Minimum policyholder

position per one hundred

Per cent          dollars of the face

coverage          amount of an insured mortgage

5%                     $ .20

10                        .40

15                        .60

20                        .80

25                       1.00

30                       1.10

35                       1.20

40                       1.30

45                       1.35

50                       1.40

55                       1.50

60                       1.55

65                       1.60

70                       1.65

75                       1.75

80                       1.80

85                       1.85

90                       1.90

95                       1.95

100                      2.00

If the per cent coverage is between any five percentage point increment, the factor for minimum policyholder position per one hundred dollars of the face amount of an insured mortgage shall be prorated.

2. If the total indebtedness is at least fifty per cent and not more than seventy-five per cent of the value of the collateral property at the date of insurance, the required amount of minimum policyholder position is fifty per cent of the amount required by paragraph 1 of this subsection.

3. If the total indebtedness is less than fifty per cent of the value of the collateral property at the date of insurance, the required amount of minimum policyholder position is twenty-five per cent of the amount required by paragraph 1 of this subsection.

C. If a policy of mortgage guaranty insurance provides coverage on a pool of loans subject to an aggregate loss limit and if the equity:

1. Is not more than fifty per cent and not less than twenty per cent, or equity plus any prior insurance or a deductible equals twenty-five per cent of the value of the collateral property at the date of insurance, the required amount of minimum policyholder position is calculated as follows:

Minimum policyholder

position per one hundred

Per cent          dollars of the face

coverage          amount of an insured  mortgage

1%                    $ .30

5                       .50

10                       .60

15                       .65

50                       .825

60                       .85

70                       .875

75                       .90

80                       .925

90                       .95

  100                1.00

If the per cent coverage is between any specified increment, the factor for minimum policyholder position per one hundred dollars of the face amount of an insured mortgage shall be prorated.

2. Is less than twenty per cent or the equity plus prior insurance or a deductible is less than twenty-five per cent of the value of the collateral property at the date of insurance, the required amount of minimum policyholder position is two hundred per cent of the amount required by paragraph 1 of this subsection.

3. Is more than fifty per cent or the equity plus prior insurance or a deductible is more than fifty-five per cent of the value of the collateral property at the date of insurance, the required amount of minimum policyholder position is fifty per cent of the amount of minimum policyholder position required by paragraph 1 of this subsection.

D. If a policy of mortgage guaranty insurance provides for layers of coverage, deductibles or excess reinsurance, the required amount of minimum policyholder position may be computed by subtracting the required minimum policyholder position for the lower percentage coverage limits from the required minimum policyholder position for the upper or greater coverage limit.

E. If a policy of mortgage guaranty insurance provides for coverage on loans secured by second liens:

1. If the policy provides coverage on individual loans, the required amount of minimum policyholder position is calculated according to subsection B of this section after the per cent of coverage and the loan-to-value ratios have been determined as follows:

(a) Divide the insured portion of the second loan by the entire loan indebtedness on the collateral property to determine the per cent coverage.

(b) Divide the entire loan indebtedness on the property by the value of the collateral property at the date of insurance to determine loan-to-value per cent.

2. If the policy provides coverage on a group of loans subject to an aggregate loss limit, the minimum policyholder position is calculated according to subsection C of this section after the per cent of coverage and the loan-to-value ratios have been determined in accordance with this subsection.

F. If a policy of mortgage guaranty insurance provides for coverage on leases, the minimum policyholder position is four dollars for each one hundred dollars of the insured amount of the lease.

G. Among other remedial actions, the director may require a mortgage guaranty insurer to cease transacting new business until such time as the minimum policyholder position as required by this section is met.

H. A mortgage guaranty insurer shall include with its annual statement a report of its minimum policyholder position on a form approved by the director.

I. For the purposes of this section, except as otherwise provided:

1. "Equity" means the complement of the loan-to-value per cent.

2. "Face amount of an insured mortgage":

(a) Means outstanding principal balance computed without any reduction because of an insurer's option limiting its coverage, except that for the purposes of determining a minimum policyholder position under subsection E "face amount of the mortgage" means the entire loan indebtedness on the property.

(b) Does not include the outstanding principal balance of any indebtedness secured by the subject real property to the extent that the insurer has established a loss reserve for that indebtedness.

A. A mortgage guaranty insurance company shall not pay or cause to be paid either directly or indirectly, to any owner, purchaser, lessor, lessee, mortgagee or prospective mortgagee of the real property which secures the authorized real estate security or which is the fee of an insured lease, or any interest in such lease, or any person who is acting as an agent, representative, attorney or employee of such owner, purchaser or mortgagee, any commission, or any part of its premium charges or any other consideration as an inducement for or as compensation on any mortgage guaranty insurance business.

The amount by which any premium charge is less than that called for by the current schedule of premium charges is an unlawful rebate.

D. Notwithstanding section 20-451, section 20-452, section 20-1553, subsection B or any other provision of this section, a mortgage guaranty insurance company may enter into an agreement with a mortgage lender or an affiliate of a mortgage lender to provide financial incentives to the mortgage lender for the performance of the mortgage loans insured by the mortgage guaranty insurance company. The agreement to provide financial incentives to mortgage lenders shall not take effect unless it is filed with the director and either approved or not disapproved within thirty days after being filed. The director's disapproval shall be in writing and shall specify the reason for the disapproval. The director shall approve the agreement upon finding that:

"Title insurance" means insuring, guaranteeing or indemnifying owners of real property or others interested therein against loss or damage suffered by reason of liens, encumbrances upon, defects in or the unmarketability of the title to such property, guaranteeing, warranting or otherwise insuring the correctness of searches relating to the title to real property, or doing any business in substance equivalent to any of the foregoing.

In order to constitute a title insurance plant such records shall include:

(a) An index or indices in which notations of or references to any such documents that describe the property affected thereby are posted, entered or otherwise included, according to the property described therein, or copies or briefs of all such documents that describe the property affected thereby which are sorted and filed according to the property described therein.

(b) An index or indices in which all other such documents are posted, entered or otherwise included, according to the name or names of the parties whose title to real property or any interest therein or encumbrance thereon is affected.

Real property shall not be considered to be encumbered within the meaning of this subsection by reason of the existence of instruments reserving mineral, oil, water or timber rights, rights-of-way, sewer rights, rights in walls or driveways, by reason of liens inferior to the lien securing the loan of the insurer, or liens for taxes or assessments not yet delinquent, or by reason of building restrictions or other restrictive covenants or by reason of any lease under which rents or profits are reserved to the owner, if, in any event, the security for the loan is a first lien on the real property, and if there is no condition or right of re-entry or forfeiture under which the lien can be cut off, subordinated or otherwise disturbed.  Real property shall be deemed to be improved if such real property is a lot or portion of a subdivision or development that has been improved by off-site improvements for the general benefit of all or a portion of the subdivision or development.  No mortgage or trust deed, loan or investment in a seller's equity under a contract made or acquired by the insurer on any one property shall at the date of investment exceed seventy-five per cent of the value of the real property securing the loan, or subject to the contract, provided, however, that the limitation in respect to value shall not apply to a loan which is:

B. No title insurer shall write title insurance in, nor issue any title insurance policy with respect to risks located in, any county of this state with a population, as shown by the latest decennial census, in excess of one hundred thousand persons, unless the title insurer or its agent in that county maintains a title insurance plant covering title records of such county, or unless the insurer issues its policy based on a policy issued to it by another title insurance company, or its agent, who meets the requirements of this section provided, however, that for the purposes of this subsection a title insurer or title insurance agent shall be deemed to maintain a title insurance plant if it is a lessee thereof or joint owner or has a beneficial interest in such a plant.

A. Every title insurer shall, in addition to other reserves, establish and maintain a reserve to be known as the "unearned premium reserve" for title insurance on real estate, which shall, at all times and for all purposes, be deemed and shall constitute the unearned portions of premiums due or received on account of such insurance and shall be charged as a reserve liability of such title insurer in determining its financial condition. A foreign title insurer doing business in this state may establish an unearned premium reserve for title insurance on real estate in accordance with the laws of its domiciliary state, provided an unearned premium reserve is mandatory under the law of its domiciliary state and such law is substantially equivalent to the requirements of this title.

B. The unearned premium reserve for title insurance on real estate shall be retained and held by such title insurer for the protection of the policyholders' interest in policies on real estate which have not expired. Except as provided in section 20-1571, assets equal to the amount of such reserve shall not be subject to distribution among other creditors or stockholders of such title insurer until all claims of policyholders or holders of title insurance contracts or agreements of such title insurer have been paid in full and all liability on the policies or title insurance contracts or agreements, whether contingent or actual, has been discharged or lawfully reinsured. Income from the investment of the amount of such reserve shall be the unrestricted property of the title insurer.

#### Section 20-1569. Amount of unearned premium reserve; release

A. The unearned premium reserve of every title insurer shall consist of:

1. The amount of the unearned premium reserve held as of January 1, 1968.

2. The amount of all additions required to be made to the reserve by this section, less withdrawals permitted by this section.

B. Every title insurer shall add to its unearned premium reserve in respect to each title insurance policy, whether primary insurance, reinsurance or coinsurance, issued by it on real estate a sum of money out of the fees due or received for the title insurance and deemed to be unearned portions of fees and a sum equal to ten cents for each one thousand dollars of the face amount of net retained liability, as defined in section 20-1562, and shall separately record the aggregate amounts set aside and reserved with respect to policies, contracts or agreements written in each calendar year.

C. The amounts set aside as additions to the unearned premium reserve shall be deducted in determining net profits of any title insurer.

D. For the purpose of determining the amounts of the unearned premium reserve that may be withdrawn pursuant to subsection E of this section, and the interest of the policyholders under section 20-1571, all policies of title insurance shall be considered as dated on July 1 in the year of issue.

E. The aggregate of the amounts set aside in unearned premium reserve in any calendar year pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be released from the reserve and restored to income in the year of release pursuant to the formula prescribed in the accounting practices and procedures manual adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners.

 

#### Section 20-1570. Maintenance of the unearned premium reserve

If by reason of any cause, other than depreciation in the market value of investments, the amount of the assets of a title insurer held as investments of its unearned premium reserve should on any date be less than the amount required to be maintained by law in such reserve, and the deficiency shall not be promptly cured, such title insurer shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the director and shall issue no further title insurance policies, whether of policy insurance, reinsurance or coinsurance, until the deficiency shall have been eliminated and until it shall have received written approval from the director authorizing it again to issue such policies.

#### Section 20-1571. Use of the unearned premium reserve on liquidation, dissolution or insolvency

A. If an order of rehabilitation or of liquidation shall have been entered with respect to a title insurer in accordance with the provisions of article 4 of chapter 3 of this title, then, and notwithstanding the provisions of such article:

1. Such amount of the assets of such title insurer equal to the unearned premium reserve then remaining as is necessary may be used to pay for reinsurance of the liability of such title insurer upon all outstanding policies of title insurance, as to which claims for losses by the holders are not then pending, the balance, if any, of assets equal to the unearned premium reserve fund then remaining, then to be transferred to the general assets of the title insurer.

2. The assets other than the unearned premium reserve shall be available to pay claims for losses sustained by holders of policies then pending or arising up to the time reinsurance is effected. In the event that claims for losses are in excess of such other assets of the title insurer, such claims, when established, shall be paid pro rata out of the surplus assets attributable to the unearned premium reserve, to the extent of such surplus, if any.

B. In the event that reinsurance is not obtained, the unearned premium reserve and assets constituting minimum capital, or so much as remains thereof after outstanding claims have been paid, shall constitute a trust fund to be held by the director for twenty years, out of which claims of policyholders shall be paid as they arise. The balance, if any, of such fund shall, at the expiration of twenty years, revert to the general assets of the title insurer.

#### Section 20-1572. Reserve for unpaid losses and loss expense

A. Each title insurer shall at all times establish and maintain, in addition to other reserves, a reserve against unpaid losses, and against loss expense, and shall calculate the reserves by making a careful estimate in each case of the loss and loss expense likely to be incurred, by reason of every claim presented, pursuant to notice from or on behalf of the insured, of a title defect in or lien or adverse claim against the title insured, that may result in a loss or cause expense to be incurred for the proper disposition of the claim.  The sums of the items estimated pursuant to this section shall be the total amounts of the reserves against unpaid losses and loss expenses of the title insurer.

B. In combination with the reserves prescribed in section 20-1569 and subsection A of this section, each title insurer shall establish a supplemental reserve that consists of all other reserves that are necessary to cover the insurer's liabilities for all losses, claims and loss adjustment expenses.

C. The amounts estimated pursuant to this section may be revised from time to time as circumstances warrant, but shall be redetermined at least once each year.

D. The amounts set aside in the reserves in any year shall be deducted in determining the net profits of any title insurer for that year.

 

#### Section 20-1573. Net retained liability

A. The net retained liability of any title insurer under any single insurance risk as defined in section 20-1562, paragraphs 4 and 7 shall not exceed fifty per cent of the net amount remaining after deducting from the sum of its capital, surplus, unearned premium reserve and voluntary reserves the value, if any, assigned in such summation to its title insurance plants, all as shown in its most recent report on file with the director. The same limitation shall apply to any secondary risk assumed by means of reinsurance or coinsurance except, whenever the primary retained liability of a ceding company shall equal or exceed ten per cent of the single insurance risk liability, the net retained or assumed liability limit of this section may be increased by an additional two hundred fifty thousand dollars, but in no event above one hundred per cent of the net amount remaining after deducting from the sum of its capital and surplus the value, if any, assigned in such summation to its title insurance plants, all as shown by its most recent report on file with the director.

B. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the amount of a single insurance risk, as defined in section 20-1562, paragraph 7, that may be written or assumed by a title insurer, provided, however, that every title insurer shall cede, to one or more other title insurers, on or before the effective date of such writing or assumption, such portion, or portions, of any risk as shall be sufficient to bring its net retained liability thereunder within the limits set forth in this section; and provided further that each such cession of risk shall also be within the limits of this section as applied to the sum of the capital, surplus, unearned premium reserve and voluntary reserves, less the value, if any, assigned in such summation to the title insurance plants of the assuming and reinsuring title insurer, as shown by its most recent report on file with the supervisory agency in the state of its domicile.

#### Section 20-1574. Power to reinsure

A. Any title insurer authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state may cede reinsurance of all or any part of its liability under one or more of its title insurance policies to any title insurer authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this or any other state, provided, however, that no larger amount of reinsurance shall be ceded to any title insurer on a single policy of title insurance, or on any single title insurance risk, than such title insurer would be permitted to retain if authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state.

B. Any title insurer authorized to do business in this state may also reinsure policies of title insurance issued by other companies on risks whether located in this state or elsewhere.

C. Issuance of contracts of reinsurance by a title insurer not authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state, but authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in any of the United States, reinsuring a title insurer authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state on real property located in this state, shall not of itself constitute the doing of business in this state by such reinsurer.

D. No agreement by any domestic title insurer for the reinsurance of all or substantially all its business in force shall be effective unless it shall comply with the provisions of section 20-732.

#### Section 20-1575. Foreign title insurers; resident agent required

If in the judgment of the director delay in the return of any or all books of account of such title insurer may be hazardous, or may cause irreparable injury, to the people of this state or to the policyholders of such title insurer, he may direct the return thereof without notice and hearing.

3. The named insured, any person who resides in the same household as the named insured and who customarily operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy or any other person who regularly and frequently operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy:

(a) Has had the person's driver license suspended or revoked during the policy period.

(b) Develops a permanent disability, either physically or mentally, and the person does not produce a certificate from a physician or a registered nurse practitioner testifying to the person's ability to operate a motor vehicle.

(c) Is or has been convicted during the thirty-six months immediately preceding the effective date of the policy or during the policy period of:

(i) Criminal negligence resulting in death, homicide or assault and arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle.

(iii) Leaving the scene of an accident.

(iv) Making false statements in an application for a driver license.

(v) Reckless driving.

4. The insurer is placed in rehabilitation or receivership by the insurance supervisory official in its state of domicile or by a court of competent jurisdiction or the director has suspended the insurer's certificate of authority based on its financially hazardous condition.

5. The named insured, any person who resides in the same household as the named insured and who customarily operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy or any other person who regularly and frequently operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy uses a motor vehicle rated or insured under the policy as a private passenger motor vehicle regularly and frequently for commercial purposes.

6. The named insured, any person who resides in the same household as the named insured and who customarily operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy or any other person who regularly and frequently operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy uses a motor vehicle rated or insured under the policy to provide transportation network services unless, while the driver is logged in to the transportation network company's digital network or software application to be a driver or is providing transportation network services, the named insured either:

(a) Has procured an endorsement to the private passenger policy that expressly provides such coverage.

(b) Is covered by a motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued by another insurer expressly providing such coverage.

7. The director determines that the continuation of the policy would place the insurer in violation of the laws of this state or would jeopardize the solvency of the insurer.

E. An insurer may nonrenew a motor vehicle insurance policy if the insurer complies with this article.  An insurer shall provide notice of a nonrenewal to the named insured as prescribed by section 20-1632. A named insured who disputes the nonrenewal of the named insured's policy may file an objection with the director pursuant to section 20-1633.

F. The company shall not cancel the insurance when a person other than the named insured has violated subsection D, paragraph 3 of this section, if the named insured in writing agrees to exclude as insured the person by name when operating a motor vehicle and further agrees to exclude coverage to the named insured for any negligence that may be imputed by law to the named insured arising out of the maintenance, operation or use of a motor vehicle by the excluded person.  The written agreement that excludes coverage under a policy for a named individual is effective for each renewal of the policy by the insurer and remains in effect until the insurer agrees in writing to provide coverage for the named individual who was previously excluded from coverage.

G. This article does not apply to any policy that has been in effect less than sixty days at the time notice of cancellation is mailed or delivered by the insurer unless the policy is a renewal policy, or to policies:

1. Insuring any motor vehicle other than a private passenger motor vehicle as defined in section 20-117.

2. Insuring the motor vehicle hazard of garages, motor vehicle sales agencies, repair shops, service stations or public parking places.

3. Providing insurance only on an excess basis.

H. If a consumer purchases motor vehicle insurance coverage from an insurance producer licensed in this state, the insurance producer that owns the policy expiration shall remain the insurance producer of record for that insured. If the insurer terminates the insurance producer's contract, the insurance producer shall continue to provide customary services to the insured. The insurer shall provide the insurance producer with a minimum degree of authority necessary to provide customary services to the insured and shall provide the same level of compensation for these services that were in effect before the termination of the insurance producer contract.

I. Subsection H of this section does not apply if one or more of the following conditions exist:

1. The insurance producer of record has had its license suspended or revoked by the department.

2. The insurance producer of record is indebted to the insurer.

3. The insured has supplied the insurer with a written request that its insurance producer of record be changed to another insurance producer of the insurer.

4. The insurance producer of record has authorized transfer of this account to another licensed insurance producer of the insurer.

5. The director has determined after a public hearing that continuation of this relationship is not in the best interest of the public.

6. The insurance producer of record is under an exclusive contract or contract requiring the insurance producer to submit all eligible business to an insurer or group of insurers under a common management.

J. Subsection H of this section does not apply to any transaction in which the expiration of the policies is owned by the insurer.

K. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if an insurer chooses to renew a policy, the issuance at renewal of revised policy provisions to modify an existing policy by adding coverages or policy provisions, modifying coverages or policy provisions or eliminating coverages or policy provisions is not a nonrenewal or cancellation of the policy if the modification of a basic coverage does not eliminate the essential benefit of that basic coverage. If the modification of the basic coverage eliminates the essential benefit of the basic coverage, the director shall order the insurer to remove the modification from the policy.  This subsection does not allow the insurer, without the written consent of the insured, to eliminate the basic coverages of the policy or to reduce the monetary limits of any of the basic coverages of the policy that were selected and agreed on. If an insurer chooses to renew a policy, this subsection does not limit a policyholder from continuing to renew uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to section 20-259.01. For the purposes of this subsection, "basic coverage" means any of the following:

1. Bodily injury coverage.

2. Property damage coverage.

3. Uninsured motorist coverage.

4. Underinsured motorist coverage.

5. Medical payments coverage.

6. Comprehensive coverage.

7. Collision coverage.

L. For the purposes of this section, fail to renew or nonrenewal does not include the issuance and delivery of a new policy within the same insurer or an insurer under the same ownership or management as the original insurer as provided in this subsection.  An insurer may transfer any of its policies to an affiliated insurer.  An insurer may not transfer policyholders because of their location of residence, age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin or ancestry. A transfer by an insurer pursuant to this subsection does not allow the insurer to apply a new unrestricted sixty-day period for cancellation or nonrenewal.

M. Except as provided in this subsection, an insurer shall not refuse to renew a policy, based on an insured's failure to maintain membership in a bona fide association, until both the insurer and bona fide association have complied with this subsection and shall not refuse to renew any coverage continuously in effect before September 1, 1998, subject to all the following:

1. In addition to any other reason provided in this section, an insurer may refuse to renew an insurance policy issued pursuant to this article if all of the following conditions apply:

(a) The insurer clearly discloses to the applicant and the insured in the application for insurance and insurance policy that both the payment of dues and current membership in the bona fide association are prerequisites to obtaining or renewing the insurance.

(b) Any money paid to the bona fide association as a membership fee:

(i) Is not used by the insurer directly or indirectly to defray any costs or expenses in connection with the sale or purchase of the insurance.

(ii) Is set independently of any factor used by the insurer to make any judgment or determination about the eligibility of any individual, including the member, an employee of a member or a dependent of a member, to purchase or renew the insurance.

(c) The bona fide association has filed a certification with the director verifying the eligibility of the insurer to refuse to renew an insurance policy based on membership in the bona fide association.

2. To qualify as a bona fide association pursuant to this subsection, the association shall meet all of the requirements of this paragraph. The association shall file a statement with the director at least thirty days before the commencement of the offer or sale of insurance as provided by this subsection verifying that the association meets the requirements of this paragraph. The association shall update the filing required by this paragraph at least thirty days before the effective date of any material change in the information contained in the statement and shall file a separate notice with the director if the insurance described in the statement is no longer available through the association. The statement shall include the following information:

(a) That the association has been in active existence for at least five consecutive years immediately before the filing of the statement.

(b) That the association has been formed and maintained in good faith for purposes other than obtaining or providing insurance and does not condition membership in the association on the purchase of insurance.

(c) That the association has articles of incorporation and bylaws or other similar governing documents.

(d) That the association does not condition membership in the association or set membership fees on the eligibility of any individual, including the member, an employee of the member or a dependent of the member, to purchase or renew the insurance, or on any factor that the insurer could not lawfully consider when setting rates.

(e) That the association has a relationship with a specific insurer or insurers and identifies the insurer or insurers.

3. Membership fees collected by the bona fide association are not premiums of the insurer that issued the coverage unless the bona fide association:

(a) Uses any portion of the membership fees directly or indirectly to defray any costs or expenses in connection with the sale or purchase of the insurance.

(b) Sets or adjusts membership fees for any member of the bona fide association based on any factor used by the insurer that issues the insurance to make any judgment or determination about the eligibility of any individual, including the member, an employee of the member or a dependent of the member, to purchase or renew the insurance.

4. If the membership fees constitute premiums pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection, an insurer shall not refuse to renew a policy as otherwise allowed by this subsection.

N. An insurer or insurance producer shall not inquire on an application for a motor vehicle insurance policy whether the applicant, any person who resides in the same household as the applicant and who customarily operates a motor vehicle to be insured under the policy or any other person who regularly and frequently operates a motor vehicle to be insured under the policy has been nonrenewed by an insurer.

O. An insurer may issue an endorsement to a private passenger policy that expressly provides coverage for the provision of transportation network services, but that endorsement may not be treated as basic coverage as defined in subsection K of this section and any termination of the endorsement may not be treated as a modification of basic coverage. An insurer may terminate the endorsement allowed by this subsection by giving advance notice of the termination. Any notice by the insurer to the policyholder to terminate the endorsement allowed by this subsection shall be sent to the named insured at least forty-five days before the effective date of the termination.  The notice shall include an explanation to the named insured that the further provision of transportation network services following the effective date of the termination might subject the insured to cancellation or nonrenewal of the insured's private passenger motor vehicle policy.

P. This section and section 28-4009 do not create an obligation of an insurer to offer, provide or issue a policy or an endorsement that includes coverage for any liability incurred while a transportation network company driver is logged in to the transportation network company's digital network or software application to be a driver or is providing transportation network services.

Q. For the purposes of this section, "transportation network company", "transportation network company driver" and "transportation network services" have the same meanings prescribed in section 28-9551.

#### Section 20-1632. Cancellation, nonrenewal and reduction of limits for reasons other than nonpayment of premium; notices to insured; refund of unearned premium

A. A notice by the insurer to the policyholder of cancellation or reduction in the limits of liability or coverage for reasons other than nonpayment of premium shall be sent to the named insured at least ten days before the effective date of the cancellation or reduction in limits of liability or coverage. Notice of nonrenewal for reasons other than nonpayment of premium shall be sent at least forty-five days before the effective date of the nonrenewal. A notice under this subsection shall include or be accompanied by all of the following:

1. A statement in writing of the specific facts that constitute the reasons, consistent with this article, for such action by the insurer and a notice indicating the named insured's right to complain to the director of the insurer's action within ten days after receipt of the notice by the insured.

2. Notice of the insured's possible eligibility for insurance through the automobile assigned risk plan, and the notice shall state that all information included in the notice is given pursuant to this article.

3. Except as provided in paragraph 4 of this subsection, a refund of unearned premium. For the purposes of this paragraph, the insurer shall either send the notice and refund of unearned premium together at least ten days before the effective date or send the notice before the refund of unearned premium if both the notice and the refund of unearned premium are sent separately to the insured at least ten days before the effective date.  As an alternative to sending the refund by mail, an insurer may refund the unearned premium by any electronic means previously established with the insured to make and receive premium payments for the policy.

4. In the case of a notice of cancellation or nonrenewal of a policyholder whose premium payment is collected and remitted on the insurer's behalf by the insurer's affiliate, the insurer shall refund any unearned premium to the policyholder within ten days after the policy cancellation or nonrenewal. For the purposes of this paragraph, "affiliate" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-481.

B. Failure of the insurer to comply with subsection A of this section shall invalidate any cancellation, nonrenewal or reduction in limits of liability or coverage.

C. If a premium has been financed, a refund of unearned premium shall be returned as provided in section 6-1416.

#### Section 20-1632.01. Cancellation or nonrenewal for nonpayment of premium; grace period; notice of cancellation; discrimination; definition

A. Motor vehicle insurance policies shall contain a provision that the policyholder is entitled to a minimum grace period of seven days for the payment of any premium due except the first payment, during which grace period the policy shall continue in full force. For the purposes of this subsection, an initial payment on the renewal of a policy is not a first payment of premium.

B. For any motor vehicle insurance policy that is cancelled or nonrenewed for nonpayment of premium by the insurer after the grace period, the insurer must send a notice of cancellation or nonrenewal to the policyholder.  The cancellation or nonrenewal is effective on the date the notice is sent to the policyholder.  The notice shall include or be accompanied by a statement in writing of the reasons for such action by the insurer and a notice indicating the named insured's right to complain to the director of the insurer's action within ten days after receipt of the notice by the insured. An insurer shall not cancel or nonrenew a motor vehicle insurance policy pursuant to this section because of the named insured's location of residence, age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry or driving record.

C. This section does not apply to policies being cancelled pursuant to section 6-1415. The grace period provided in such policies shall be satisfied by the ten-day notice of intent of the premium finance company to cancel the insurance contract unless the default is cured within the ten-day period.

D. For the purposes of this section, "grace period" means the period of time after the premium due date during which the policy remains in force without penalty even though the premium due has not been paid.

#### Section 20-1633. Objections; investigation; determination

A. Any individual who believes cancellation of the individual's policy is arbitrary, capricious or otherwise in violation of this article, who believes nonrenewal is in violation of this article or who believes notice of nonrenewal or cancellation, or the reasons for nonrenewal or cancellation, were not given as provided by this article, within ten days after receipt of notice, may file in writing an objection to the action with the director.

B. On receipt of a written objection pursuant to this article, the director shall notify the insurer of receipt of the objection and of the right of the insurer to file a written response within ten days of receipt of the notification.  The director may also order an examination of the objection or complaint, the submission of additional information by the insured or the insurer about the action by the insurer or the objections of the insured, or any other procedure as the director deems appropriate or necessary.  The insurer shall pay the cost of the examination pursuant to section 20-159.  Within fifteen days of receipt of the written objection by an insured the director shall approve or disapprove the insurer's action and shall notify the insured and insurer in writing of the director's final decision.  The director shall order an insurer that has failed to renew a policy in violation of this article to reinstate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the nonrenewal.  Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, either party may institute proceedings for judicial review of the director's final decision pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6. Notwithstanding any other law, if the director decides in favor of the insured, the director may order that the decision not be stayed pending judicial review.

 

#### Section 20-1634. Immunity

The director or any person who in good faith furnishes to the insured or insurer information as to reasons for cancellation or nonrenewal of a motor vehicle policy shall not be liable to any party for providing such information.

### Article 12 - Cancellation or Nonrenewal of Insurance

#### Section 20-1651. Application; types of risks

This article shall apply to policies of insurance, other than motor vehicle insurance and workers' compensation insurance, on risks located or resident in this state which insure any of the following contingencies:

1. Loss of or damage to real property which is used predominantly for residential purposes and which consists of not more than four dwelling units.

2. Loss of or damage to personal property in which natural persons resident in specifically described real property of the kind described in paragraph 1 have an insurable interest, except personal property used in the conduct of a commercial or industrial enterprise.

3. Legal liability of a natural person for loss, damage or injury to persons or property, but not including policies primarily insuring risks arising from the conduct of a commercial or industrial enterprise.

#### Section 20-1652. Grounds for valid notice of cancellation; inquiries; definitions

A. After a policy has been in effect for sixty days or, if the policy is a renewal, effective immediately, a notice of cancellation is not effective unless it is based on the occurrence, after the effective date of the policy, of one or more of the following:

1. Nonpayment of premium.

2. Conviction of the named insured of a crime arising out of acts increasing the hazard insured against.

3. Acts or omissions by the insured or the insured's representative constituting fraud or material misrepresentation in obtaining the policy, continuing the policy or presenting a claim under the policy.

4. Discovery of grossly negligent acts or omissions by the insured substantially increasing any of the hazards insured against.

5. Substantial change in the risk assumed by the insurer, since the policy was issued, except to the extent that the insurer should reasonably have foreseen the change or contemplated the risk in writing the contract.

6. A determination by the director that the continuation of the policy would place the insurer in violation of the insurance laws of this state.

7. Failure of the insured to take reasonable steps to eliminate or reduce any conditions in or on the insured premises that contributed to a loss in the past or will increase the probability of future losses.

B. If nonrenewal is based on the condition of the premises, the insured shall be given thirty days' notice to remedy the identified conditions.  If the identified conditions are remedied, coverage shall be renewed.  If the identified conditions are not satisfactorily remedied, the insured shall be given an additional thirty days, on payment of premium, to cure the defective condition. Any insured who believes nonrenewal under this subsection is arbitrary or capricious may use the appeal procedures set forth in section 20-1633.

C. If an insurer uses for underwriting purposes information from a report provided by, or database maintained by, an insurance support organization or consumer reporting agency related to the premises that is the subject of the application or to the person applying for insurance, the insurer shall obtain that information as soon as practicable on application by a person for insurance coverage and before the issuance of a binder of insurance coverage. Failure of the insurer to timely obtain the information required by this subsection precludes the insurer from declining insurance coverage or terminating a binder of insurance coverage based on the information. This subsection does not apply to a policy renewal.

D. This section does not affect the provisions of section 20-1120.

E. After thirty days from the application by an insured for insurance coverage, no declination of insurance coverage or termination of a binder shall be based on information from a consumer report, including a consumer report provided by, or database maintained by, an insurance support organization or consumer reporting agency related to the premises that is the subject of the application or to the person applying for insurance. Notwithstanding any other law, an insurer may decline or terminate insurance coverage based on the condition of the premises as determined through a physical inspection of the premises.

F. An insurer shall not consider as a claim any inquiry by an insured into whether a policy will cover a loss or about the type or level of coverage.  An insurer shall not use such an inquiry, regardless of the source of the information that an inquiry was made, as a basis for declining, nonrenewing or canceling insurance coverage or a binder of insurance coverage.  An insurer shall not submit to any insurance support organization or consumer reporting agency that a mere inquiry was made to the insurer as to the terms or coverage of a policy of insurance.  An inquiry into coverage on a property insurance policy is not a claim activity unless an actual claim is filed by the insured that results in an investigation of the claim by the insurer.

G. For the purposes of this section, nonrenewal does not include the issuance and delivery of a new policy within the same insurer or an insurer under the same ownership or management as the original insurer as provided in this subsection. An insurer may transfer any of its policies to an affiliated insurer. An insurer may not transfer a policyholder because of the policyholder's location of residence, age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin or ancestry. A transfer by an insurer pursuant to this subsection does not allow the insurer to apply a new unrestricted sixty-day period for cancellation or nonrenewal.

H. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Consumer reporting agency" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-2102.

2. "Insurance support organization" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-2102.

#### Section 20-1653. Sending notice of cancellation or nonrenewal to insured; statement of grounds and facts on which cancellation or nonrenewal is based

All notices of cancellation or nonrenewal shall be in writing, shall be sent to the named insured and shall state, with respect to cancellation of policies in effect after the time limits specified in section 20-1652 and, in the case of nonrenewal of policies as specified in section 20-1654:

1. In the case of cancellation the specific facts that constitute the grounds set forth in section 20-1652 relied on.

2. In the case of nonrenewal the specific facts that constitute the reason the policy is not being renewed, which may include the grounds set forth in section 20-1652.

#### Section 20-1654. Sending notice of intention not to renew to insured; time; term of policy

A. Unless the insurer, at least thirty days before the end of the policy period, sends to the named insured notice of its intention not to renew the policy or to condition its renewal on reduction of limits or elimination of coverages, the insurer shall not fail to renew the policy on payment of the premium due on the effective date of the renewal, in accordance with the then existing rating manual of the insurer.

B. For the purposes of this section:

1. Any policy written for a term of less than one year may be renewed for a term of one year if the notice is not given as required by subsection A of this section. For the purposes of subsection A of this section, a policy with no fixed expiration date is deemed written for successive policy periods of one year.

2. Nonrenewal does not include the issuance and delivery of a new policy within the same insurer or an insurer under the same ownership or management as the original insurer as provided in this paragraph. An insurer may transfer any of its policies to an affiliated insurer. An insurer may not transfer a policyholder because of the policyholder's location of residence, age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin or ancestry. A transfer by an insurer pursuant to this paragraph does not allow the insurer to apply a new unrestricted sixty-day period for cancellation or nonrenewal.

C. This section does not apply if the insured has accepted replacement coverage or has agreed to nonrenewal.

#### Section 20-1655. Liability of insurer and representatives for statements in notice of cancellation, other communication or evidence given in court relating to cancellation

There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against, any insurer or its authorized representatives, agents or employees, or any licensed insurance producer, for any statement made, unless shown to have been made in bad faith with malice in any of the following:

1. Written notice of cancellation or nonrenewal or in any other oral or written communication specifying the reasons for cancellation or nonrenewal.

2. Communication providing information pertaining to such cancellation or nonrenewal.

3. Evidence submitted at any court proceeding or informal inquiry in which such cancellation or nonrenewal is an issue.

#### Section 20-1656. Proof of sending as proof of notice

A. Proof of sending a notice of cancellation and the reasons for cancellation or of intention not to renew to the named insured by mail at the address shown in the policy is sufficient proof of the notice required by this article.

B. Any method of proof retained by the insurer for sending a notice of cancellation by any method other than by mail is sufficient proof of the notice required by this article.

### Article 13 - Mass Marketed Life or Health Insurance

#### Section 20-1661. Definitions

A. In this article, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Direct response solicitation" means any offer by an insurer to persons in this state, either directly or through a third party, to effect life or health insurance coverage which enables the individual to apply or enroll for the insurance on the basis of the offer.

2. "Mass marketed life or health insurance" means insurance under any franchise, group or blanket policy of life or health insurance which is offered by means of direct response solicitation through a sponsoring organization or through the mails or other mass communications media and under which the person who is insured pays all or substantially all of the cost of his insurance.

B. In this article, "direct response solicitation" does not include solicitations for insurance through an employee benefit plan or a solicitation through the individual's creditor with respect to credit life or credit health insurance.

1. Make available for the purpose of determining compliance with this article copies of any such policy or certificates issued under such policy and advertising material used within this state in connection with such insurance.

2. Comply with the requirements of this state relating to advertising and to claims settlement practices.

#### Section 20-1663. Unreasonable mass marketed insurance prohibited; hearing; findings; rules

A. No mass marketed life or health insurance may continue to be transacted in this state if the director finds that the total charges for the insurance to the persons who are insured are unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided. The director shall make any such finding after conducting a hearing on not less than thirty days' written notice to the insurer. The director shall make such findings in writing, including the reasons for such findings, and may issue an order directing the insurer to cease transacting such insurance. Such an order continues in effect until the director determines that the total charges for the insurance are found to be reasonable in relation to the benefits.

B. The director may adopt reasonable rules to determine whether the total charges for the insurance to persons insured are unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided.

C. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the director to set rates.

### Article 14 - Cancellation or Nonrenewal of Commercial Insurance

2. "Expiration date" means the date on which coverage under a policy ends as set forth in the policy. For a policy written for a term longer than one year or with no fixed expiration date, each annual anniversary date of the policy is the expiration date.

3. "Nonpayment of premium" means the failure or inability of the named insured to discharge any obligation in connection with the payment of premiums on a policy of insurance subject to this article, whether the payments are payable directly to the insurer or its agent or payable through a premium finance plan or extension of credit.

4. "Nonrenewal" means termination of a policy at its expiration date.

5.

#### Section 20-1673. Grounds for valid cancellation

1. The policy has been in effect for sixty days.

2. The policy is a renewal, effective immediately.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, an insurer may cancel a policy for either of the following:

(d) A substantial breach of contractual duties or conditions.

(f) A determination by the director that the continuation of the policy would place the insurer in violation of the insurance laws of this state or would jeopardize the solvency of the insurer.

(g) Acts or omissions by the insured or the insured's representative that materially increase the hazard insured against.

#### Section 20-1674. Notice of cancellation; refund of unearned premium

A. A cancellation under section 20-1673 is not effective unless the insurer sends a copy of the notice of cancellation to the insured's agent and to the named insured at least forty-five days before the effective date of the cancellation, except that, if cancellation is for nonpayment of premium, at least ten days' notice of cancellation must be given. The notice must state the specific facts that constitute the grounds set forth in section 20-1673 that are relied on.  If the insurer sends the notice by mail, the insurer shall obtain proof of mailing by United States certified mail or first class mail using intelligent mail barcode or another similar tracking method used or approved by the United States postal service.

B. The notice of cancellation and any refund of unearned premium may be sent separately, but both must be sent within the time frames established in subsection A of this section.  If a premium has been financed, a refund of unearned premium shall be returned as provided in section 6-1416.

#### Section 20-1675. Liability of insurer and representatives for statements in notice of cancellation, other communication or evidence given in court relating to cancellation

A nonrenewal of any policy of insurance to which this article applies is not effective unless the insurer sends a copy of the notice of nonrenewal to the insured's agent and to the named insured at least forty-five days before the end of the policy period of its intention not to renew the policy. The transfer of a policyholder between companies within the same insurance group or changes in deductibles, premium, amount of insurance or coverage are not refusals to renew.

C.

D. All permits shall be nontransferable.

E. The director shall review an application for a provisional permit for completeness and issue a report of deficiencies to the applicant within sixty days of receipt of the application.

Under the provisional permit, the applicant may solicit reservations for residences in the facility and reservations for the provision of services in private residences and collect deposits therefor.

In the event the reservation agreement is rescinded, all money or property, including accrued interest thereon, shall be returned to the person.

 

#### Section 20-1804. Entrance fee escrow

A. As a condition for the issuance of a permit pursuant to section 20-1803, the director shall require that the provider establish an escrow account with a licensed agent which provides that all of any entrance fee received by the provider prior to the date the resident is permitted to occupy his or her living unit in the facility or the date the contract holder is to begin receiving services in his or her private residence be placed in escrow with a bank, trust company or other escrow agent approved by the director, subject to the condition that such funds may be released only as follows:

1. If the entrance fee applies to a contract holder who will be receiving services in his or her private residence, the entrance fee shall be released to the provider at such time as the life care contract commences.

2. If the entrance fee applies to a living unit which has been previously occupied in the facility, the entrance fee shall be released to the provider at such time as the living unit becomes available for occupancy by the new resident.

3. If the entrance fee applies to a living unit which has not previously been occupied by any resident, the entrance fee, or that portion of the entrance fee not to be held in escrow pursuant to section 20-1806, shall be released to the provider at such time as the director is satisfied that all of the following conditions exist:

(a) Construction or purchase of the facility has been substantially completed and an occupancy permit covering the living unit has been issued by the local government having authority to issue such permits.

(b) A commitment has been received by the provider for any permanent mortgage loan or other long-term financing described in the statement of anticipated source and application of funds submitted by the provider as part of its permit application, and any conditions of the commitment prior to disbursement of funds thereunder have been substantially satisfied.

(c) Aggregate entrance fees received or receivable by the provider pursuant to binding life care contracts, plus the anticipated proceeds of any first mortgage loan or other long-term financing commitment are equal to not less than ninety per cent of the aggregate cost of constructing or purchasing, equipping and furnishing the facility plus not less than ninety per cent of the funds estimated in the statement of anticipated source and application of funds submitted by the provider as part of its permit application, to be necessary to fund start-up losses and assure full performance of the obligations of the provider pursuant to life care contracts.

B. If the funds in an escrow account required to be established under subsection A are not released within such time as provided by rules and regulations issued by the director, then such funds shall be returned by the escrow agent to the persons who had made payment to the provider.

C. An entrance fee held in escrow may be returned by the escrow agent to the person or persons who had made payment to the provider at any time upon receipt by the escrow agent of notice from the provider that such person is entitled to a refund of the entrance fee.

D. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring the escrow of any nonrefundable application fee, designated as such in the permit application required by section 20-1802, received by the provider from a prospective resident or contract holder.

 

#### Section 20-1805. Recording of lien by director

A. The director shall, as a condition to granting a permit to an applicant, record with the county recorder of any county a notice of lien against the facility's properties on behalf of all residents and contract holders who enter into life care contracts with the applicant to secure performance of the provider's obligations to residents and contract holders pursuant to life care contracts.

B. From the time of such recording there exists a lien for an amount equal to the reasonable value of services to be performed under a life care contract in favor of each resident and contract holder on the land and improvements of the facility's properties owned by the provider, not exempt from execution, which are listed in the notice of lien filed pursuant to subsection C of this section and which are located in the county in which the notice of lien is recorded.

C. The lien shall be perfected by the director by executing by affidavit the notice and claim of lien, which shall contain:

1. The legal description of the lands and improvements to be charged with a lien.

2. The name of the owner of the property affected.

3. A statement providing that the lien has been filed by the director pursuant to section 20-1805.

D. The lien may be released or partially released at the request of the applicant if, in the judgment of the director, such release or partial release inures to the benefit of the residents and contract holders and the performance of the provider's obligations to the residents and contract holders.

E. The lien may be foreclosed by civil action. Any number of persons claiming liens against the same property pursuant to this section may join in the same action. If separate actions are commenced, the court may consolidate such actions. The court shall, as part of the costs, allow reasonable attorney's fees for each claimant who is a party to the action.

F. In a civil action filed pursuant to this section, the judgment shall be given in favor of each resident and contract holder having a lien who has joined in the foreclosure action for the amount equal to the reasonable value of services to be performed under a life care contract in favor of each resident and contract holder. The court shall order the sheriff to sell any property subject to the lien at the time judgment is given, in the same manner as real and personal property is sold on execution. The lien for the reasonable value of services to be performed under a life care contract shall be on equal footing with claims of other residents and contract holders. If a sale is ordered and the property sold and the proceeds of the sale are not sufficient to discharge all liens of residents and contract holders against the property, the proceeds shall be prorated among the respective residents and contract holders.

G. The liens provided for in this section are preferred to all liens, mortgages or other encumbrances upon the property attaching subsequently to the time the lien is recorded and are preferred to all unrecorded liens, mortgages and other encumbrances. The amount secured by any lien having priority to the lien filed pursuant to this section may not be increased without prior approval of the director.

H. The director shall file a release of the lien upon proof of complete performance of all obligations to residents and contract holders pursuant to life care contracts.

I. The director may subordinate any lien filed pursuant to this section to the lien of a first mortgage or other long-term financing obtained by the provider, regardless of the time at which the subsequent lien attaches.

 

#### Section 20-1806. Reserve fund escrow

The director shall, as a condition of the issuance of a permit pursuant to section 20-1803, require that the provider maintain on a current basis, in escrow with a bank, trust company or other escrow agent approved by the director, an amount which equals the aggregate principal and interest payments due during the next twelve months on account of any first mortgage or other long-term financing of the facility. The principal of the escrow account may be invested with the earnings thereon payable to the provider, and up to one-sixth of the total principal shall be released to the provider upon notice to the director. The escrow agreement shall provide that upon withdrawal of any such amount by the provider, the escrow agent shall provide immediate written notice of such withdrawal to the director and that any amount released to the provider shall be repaid to the escrow account within two years of the release of such amount. In the event that the provider does not repay the escrow account within such two year period, the escrow agent shall provide immediate written notice to the director.

#### Section 20-1807. Annual report; civil penalty

A. Each year not later than ninety days after the last day of the provider's fiscal year, each provider shall file with the department an annual report accompanied by the fee prescribed in section 20-167. The annual report shall include the information required by section 20-1802, subsection B, except that the information required by section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraphs 5, 15 and 17 shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of subsection C of this section. The annual report need not include the information required by section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraph 16. The annual report shall be made on forms provided by the department.  The annual report and any amendment to the annual report shall be signed under oath by the chief executive officer of the provider. For good cause, the director may extend the due date for a provider to file its annual report and pay the required fee.

B. A provider shall amend its annual report on file with the department at any time, without the payment of any additional fee, if an amendment is necessary to prevent the annual report from containing a material misstatement of fact or omitting to state a material fact required to be stated.

C. Any provider, manager or promoter shall comply with the requirements of this section as follows:

1. Information required by section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraph 5 shall be filed:

(a) Immediately on the substitution or installation of a member of the board of directors or an officer, trustee or managing partner different from the information disclosed in the provider's application or submission pursuant to subdivision (b).

(b) Every three years after the initial filing of the biographical affidavit by the provider.

2. Certified financial statements required by section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraph 15 for the two most recent fiscal years shall be filed with the annual report by the provider and manager only. The certified financial statements of the promoter shall be filed with the annual report unless the promoter is not currently employed by the provider.

3. The actuarial study required by section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraph 17 shall be filed by the provider on a triennial basis beginning with the year in which resident occupancy began at the facility or contract holders began receiving services pursuant to the permit issued to the provider. The director may require a provider to file an actuarial study on a more frequent basis if the director deems it necessary and may adjust subsequent triennial filings accordingly.

D. A provider shall not change the fiscal year end date disclosed pursuant to section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraph 4 without the prior approval of the director. The director shall approve the change if the commissioner of the internal revenue service grants a request for a change of a fiscal year pursuant to 26 United States Code

E. Assets shall be reported at values determined pursuant to sections 20-511 through 20-515.  If the director deems it necessary to value any real estate the director may employ one or more competent appraisers for that purpose, and the reasonable expense shall be borne by the provider.

F. The director may assess and collect a civil penalty of not more than twenty-five dollars for each day the annual report is late against a provider who fails to file the annual report timely accompanied by the required fee.

 

#### Section 20-1808. Ratio of assets to liabilities; report; rehabilitation of provider

A. The provider shall possess assets in the first year of operation equal to at least seventy-five percent of the unamortized endowment fees plus all other liabilities including long-term debt. The unamortized endowment fees shall be based on life expectancy of purchasers.  Thereafter, the provider shall at all times possess assets in an amount sufficient to assure full performance of the obligations of the provider pursuant to life care contracts including any reserve fund escrow required by the director pursuant to section 20-1806.

B. If revenues or funds including reserves are inadequate or projected to be inadequate pursuant to the annual report or an actuarial report or if the provider does not meet the requirements of subsection A of this section, the director may employ an independent management consultant experienced in the operation of life care facilities, at the expense of the provider, who shall examine the financial structure and operations of the provider and make recommendations on remedial action to the director. The director shall not be bound by such recommendations.

C. If at any time the director receives notice from the escrow agent that section 20-1806 has not been complied with, if at any other time when the director has reason to believe that the provider is in a financially unsound or unsafe condition or that its condition is such that it may otherwise be unable to fully perform its obligations pursuant to life care contracts, if the provider fails to implement the director's recommendations as a result of a management consultant's report or if it is obvious to the director that to obtain the services of a financial consultant under subsection B of this section would be futile, the director, through the attorney general, shall apply to the superior court in the county in which the provider's facility is located for an order directing the director to assume management and possession of the provider's facility and to rehabilitate the provider to enable it to fully perform its obligation pursuant to life care contracts. The court shall act on the application on notice to the provider, and any objection to the petition shall be filed with the court within the time prescribed by such notice.

D. If the court on hearing finds that the provider is in a financially unsound or unsafe condition or that its condition is such that it may otherwise be unable to fully perform its obligations pursuant to life care contracts, the court shall issue an order directing the director to take possession of the property of the provider and to conduct the business thereof, and to take such steps toward removal of the causes and conditions that have made rehabilitation necessary, as the court may direct. The order shall include a provision directing the issuance of a notice of the rehabilitation proceedings to the residents at such facility, to the provider's contract holders and to such other interested persons as the court shall direct.

E. Appointment of the director to rehabilitate a provider shall authorize the director to:

1. Take possession of and preserve, protect and recover any assets, books and records or property of the provider, including claims or causes of action that belong to or that may be asserted by the provider, and to deal with such property in the director's name in the capacity as director, and purchase at any sale any real estate or other asset on which the provider may hold any lien or encumbrance or in which it may have an interest.

2. File, prosecute and defend or compromise any suit or suits that have been filed or that may thereafter be filed by or against the provider and that are deemed by the director to be necessary to protect the provider or the residents or contract holders or any property affected thereby.

3. Take possession of and deposit and invest any of the provider's available funds.

4. Pay all expenses of the rehabilitation.

5. Exercise such other powers and duties as may be provided by order of the court.

6. Appoint managers, supervisors or employees necessary to properly manage and operate the provider and the provider's facility.

7. Take possession of and, with the prior approval of the court, sell, exchange, lease, mortgage or otherwise dispose of any property of the provider by public sale, bidding or otherwise.

8. With the prior approval of the court, borrow money with or without security for the purpose of facilitating the rehabilitation of the provider.

9. Perform all duties of the provider.

10. Reject any executory contract to which the provider is a party.

11. Withdraw any sums remaining in the escrow account established pursuant to section 20-1806 for the purpose of rehabilitating the provider's facility.

F. The court may at any time during a rehabilitation proceeding issue such other instructions or orders as are deemed necessary to aid the director in the rehabilitation proceeding.

G. The director, or any interested person on due notice to the director, at any time may apply to the court for an order terminating the rehabilitation proceedings and allowing the provider to resume possession of its property and the conduct of its business, but no such order shall be granted except when, after a full hearing, the court has determined that the purposes of the proceeding have been fully accomplished and that the facility can be returned to the provider's management without further jeopardy to the residents of the facility, creditors, owners of the facility and the public. An order terminating the rehabilitation proceeding shall be based on a full report and accounting by the director of the conduct of the provider's officers during the rehabilitation and of the provider's current financial condition.

H. If at any time the director deems that further efforts to rehabilitate the provider would be useless, the director may report to the court and apply for an order of liquidation and dissolution pursuant to title 10, chapter 14, article 3, if a corporation, or may apply for other appropriate relief for dissolving the provider and winding up its affairs. An order directing the liquidation or dissolution of the provider shall act as a revocation of the provider's permit issued pursuant to section 20-1803.

I. In connection with the rehabilitation proceedings, the director may appoint one or more special deputy directors of the department of insurance and financial institutions to act for the director and may employ such counsel, clerks or assistants as the director deems necessary.  The compensation of the special deputies, counsel, clerks or assistants and any expenses of taking possession of the provider's facility and of conducting the proceedings shall be set by the director, subject to approval of the court, and shall be paid out of the funds or assets of the provider.

#### Section 20-1809. Examination

The director may conduct an examination of the affairs of any provider as often as he deems it necessary for the protection of the interests of the people of this state and for this purpose shall have the powers set forth in this title with respect to examinations of insurers.

#### Section 20-1810. Rules and regulations

The director may promulgate reasonable rules and regulations for effectuating any provision of this chapter.

#### Section 20-1811. Violation; classification

After January 1, 1978, any person acting in the capacity of a provider who enters into a life care contract, or extends the term of an existing life care contract, without first having been issued a permit by the department or without otherwise acting in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall be guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor.

#### Section 20-1812. Disclosure statement; contents

At the time of or before the execution of a life care contract and the transfer of any money or other property to a provider pursuant thereto, the provider shall deliver to the person with whom the life care contract is entered into a disclosure statement that contains a copy of the provider's certified financial statements and feasibility study prepared according to section 20-1802 and any other information required by the director. The cover of the disclosure statement shall contain the following statement in bold-faced print:  "A permit for this life care facility has been issued by the Arizona department of insurance and financial institutions. This permit does not constitute approval, recommendation or endorsement of the life care facility by the department, nor does it evidence the accuracy or completeness of the information in this statement."

#### Section 20-2205. Plan of operation; contents

Within forty-five days after the effective date of the initial order of the director issued pursuant to section 20-2202, the directors of the association shall submit to the director for his review a proposed plan of operation consistent with the provisions of this chapter. The plan of operation shall provide for economic, fair and nondiscriminatory administration and for the prompt and efficient provision of liability insurance coverage in designated lines. The plan shall contain provisions pertaining to preliminary assessment of all members for initial expenses necessary to commence operations, establishment of necessary facilities, management of the association, assessment of members or surcharging of insureds to defray losses and expenses, commission arrangements, reasonable and objective underwriting standards, acceptance and cession of reinsurance, retention of servicing carriers or other servicing arrangements, procedures for determining amounts of insurance to be provided by the association and retention of persons necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter. The plan shall contain a provision for a system or program of reasonable loss control efforts.

#### Section 20-2206. Approval of plan of operation

A. The plan of operation prepared pursuant to section 20-2205 is subject to approval by the director after consultation with the members of the association and other affected individuals and organizations. If the director disapproves all or any part of the proposed plan of operation, the directors of the association, within fifteen days, shall submit for review an appropriate revised plan of operation or a part of a revised plan. If the directors of the association fail to act, the director shall promulgate a plan of operation or a part of a plan, whichever is appropriate. The plan of operation approved or promulgated by the director becomes effective and operational on order of the director.

B. A plan of operation shall require the association to issue a claims-made policy. Pending the approval of the plan of operation, the association shall designate a service company or service companies to bind the association for the coverage. The policies shall make provision for payment of dividends.

#### Section 20-2207. Amendments to the plan of operation

Amendments to the plan of operation may be made by the directors of the association, subject to the approval of the director, or shall be made at the direction of the director consistent with the provisions of section 20-2206.

#### Section 20-2208. Policies issued by the association; claims-made basis

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a liability insurance policy issued by the association shall be on a claims-made basis. The policy form shall be filed with and approved by the director.

#### Section 20-2209. Claims-made policy; cancellation

A policy issued pursuant to this chapter may provide that the association may cancel any of its policies for the reasons specified in section 20-1673 or in the event of nonpayment of any premium assessment or other charge by sending to the insured written notice at least ten days before the effective date of the cancellation.

#### Section 20-2210. Occurrence riders; premiums; assessments

A. All policies written by the association shall contain a provision that guarantees the insured that the association shall issue, on the written demand of any insured to whom it has issued a claims-made policy, an occurrence rider comparable to that provided in the voluntary market.

B. The premium for the occurrence rider shall not exceed the total amount that the insured would have paid for occurrence policies, if the occurrence policies had been issued to the insured by the association, less the total amount that the insured paid for claims-made policies issued to him by the association. However, if a majority of the directors of the association concludes that the occurrence rider premium would be inadequate, the directors may request the actuary provided for in section 20-2211 to determine whether a premium surcharge based on the experience of the policyholder should be required. Based on his actuarial opinion, the actuary may recommend to the director a premium surcharge of no more than ten per cent of the initial net occurrence rider premium. If the director approves a recommended surcharge, the surcharge shall be imposed no earlier than the end of the policy term. Individual policyholders may pay for an occurrence rider on a quarterly basis for a period of not to exceed two years. If the policyholder fails to make payment, the occurrence rider is void. A policyholder electing to pay for the occurrence rider on a deferred payment basis may be assessed a finance charge of not to exceed six per cent per year on the unpaid balance. A private insurer issuing a liability insurance policy on an occurrence or claims-made basis which replaces or begins coverage on the expiration of a policy issued by the association may provide liability coverage for acts or omissions by the insured which occurred during the period the association's policy was in effect, excluding liability for any claim of injury or loss made to the association during the period.

#### Section 20-2211. Rates; actuary

A. The rates, rating plans, rating rules, rating classifications and territories applicable to insurance written by the association, and the statistics relating thereto, are subject to the provisions of chapter 2, article 4.1 of this title, giving consideration to the past and prospective loss and expense experience for the designated class or classes of liability insurance, trends in the frequency and severity of losses, the investment income of the association and other relevant information. The premium rates for an occurrence policy and a claims-made policy for each year the association issues policies shall be established by the association. In determining whether the association's rates are not inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory, the director shall consider recommendations made by the actuary. All rates shall be on an actuarially sound basis, giving consideration to the group retrospective rating plan, and shall be calculated to be self-supporting, except that the total initial expenses necessary to establish, commence and manage operations may be amortized over a period of at least five years. Such rates shall be deemed not inadequate if they are so constituted that the expenses and loss costs of the plan of operation are equal to or exceeded by the premium. Competition or lack of competition shall not be considered as a rating standard under this section.

B. All policies issued by the association are subject to a group retrospective rating plan under which the final premium for all policyholders of the association, as a group, shall be equal to administrative, servicing and contingency expenses, modified as applicable in accordance with subsection A, loss and loss adjustment expenses, and taxes. Policyholders shall be given full credit for all investment income, net of expenses and a reasonable management fee on policyholder supplied monies. The maximum final premium for all policyholders of the association, as a group, is limited as provided in this chapter.

C. The director shall examine the association as often as he deems appropriate to ensure that the group retrospective rating plan is being operated in a manner consistent with this section. If he finds that it is not being so operated, he shall issue an order to the association, specifying in what respect its operation is deficient and stating what corrective action shall be taken.

#### Section 20-2212. Deficits; equitable assessments; premium tax credits

A. On a determination that within the next one hundred eighty days thereafter the association will be unable to pay its outstanding lawful obligations as they mature in the regular course of business as shown by an excess of such lawful obligations over admitted assets, the association shall certify to the director the existence of this condition.

B. At the time of certification, the association shall submit a schedule of policyholder surcharges and a plan of member assessments which, in combination, are sufficient to assure the continued sound financial operation of the association. The surcharge may not exceed ten per cent of the total premium paid for a policy or policies obtained through the association. Member assessments shall not exceed one per cent of each member's net direct premium in this state attributable to the line of insurance, the writing of which requires it to be a member of the association.

C. Any member of the association subject to an assessment in any one calendar year shall be allowed a premium tax credit beginning in the following calendar year, at the rate of twenty per cent per year for five years.

D. The association shall certify to the director the estimated amount of any deficit remaining after the termination of all underwriting activities of the association. Policyholder surcharges are limited to ten per cent of the annual premium.

#### Section 20-2213. Initial assessment; temporary contribution by members

A. An initial assessment of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed by the director on every participating insurer of the association to defray the initial operating expenses of the plan. The initial assessment may be refunded by the association.

B. If sufficient monies are not available for the sound financial operation of the association as provided for in this chapter, all members shall contribute to the financial requirements of the association in the manner provided for in this chapter. Any such contributions shall not exceed one per cent annually of each member's net direct premium attributable to the liability insurance the member writes as a requirement for membership in the association pursuant to section 20-2202, subsection A.

C. If the association determines that the applicant meets the underwriting standards of the association, as prescribed in the plan of operation, the association, on receipt of the premium or the portion of the premium as is prescribed in the plan of operation, shall cause a policy of liability insurance to be issued.

#### Section 20-2214. Member participation in writings, expenses, servicing allowance, management fees and losses

All members of the association shall participate in its writings, expenses, servicing allowance, management fees and losses in the proportion that the net direct premium of each member, excluding that portion of a premium attributable to the operation of the association, written during the preceding calendar year bears to the aggregate net direct premium written in this state by all members of the association.  Each member's participation in the association shall be determined annually on the basis of the net direct premium written during the preceding calendar year.

#### Section 20-2215. Appeal by applicants to the association; order

Any applicant to the association or any person insured pursuant to this chapter, or their representatives, or any affected member may appeal to the director within thirty days after any ruling, action or decision by or on behalf of the association, with respect to those items defined by the directors of the association and approved by the director as appealable matters.  Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, all final orders of the director made pursuant to this section are subject to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6, except that notwithstanding any other law, proceedings for judicial review act as a stay of the enforcement of any order or decision of the director disapproving or ordering the withdrawal, adjustment or termination of the effectiveness of any rate filing made by or on behalf of the association on the ground that the rates or premiums for the business of the association are unreasonable or excessive. The association may continue to charge rates pursuant to the filing pending final order of the court.

 

#### Section 20-2216. Annual filing; contents

Annually on or before January 1, the association shall file in the office of the director a statement which contains information with respect to its transactions, condition, operations and affairs during the preceding year. Such statement shall contain such matters and information as are prescribed and shall be in such form as is approved by the director.

This certificate may also help you avoid waiting periods or exclusions for preexisting conditions.

B. A small employer shall notify the enrollee in writing of the enrollee's qualifying event and right to continue the enrollee's and any qualified dependent's coverage within thirty days after the qualifying event.  A written communication or a notice postmarked within forty-four days after a qualifying event mailed by the employer to the enrollee's last known address satisfies this notice requirement.  Notice to the enrollee constitutes notice to any qualified dependent unless the employer knows there is a qualified dependent who does not live at the same address and knows the dependent's address, in which case a separate notice shall be sent to the qualified dependent.  The notice shall inform the enrollee and any qualified dependent of the following information:

1. The enrollee's and any qualified dependent's right to continue coverage at the full cost of the coverage, which includes the employer's contribution and the enrollee's contribution and an administrative fee for the employer that may not exceed five percent of the premium.

To continue coverage, the enrollee or a qualified dependent shall elect continuation coverage in writing for the enrollee and any qualified dependent within sixty days after the date of the notice to elect continuation coverage and submit the first month premium to the employer within forty-five days after the date of election to continue coverage.  If the enrollee or qualified dependent elects coverage pursuant to this section, coverage continues as if there had been no interruption.

E. Notwithstanding subsection D of this section, if the employer fails to provide complete, accurate and timely notice of the right to continue coverage as specified in subsection B of this section, the enrollee has one hundred twenty days after the date of the notice to elect continuation coverage and pay the required premium and administrative fee.

F. If an insurance renewal occurs during the enrollee's or qualified dependent's period of eligibility for continuation coverage, the employer shall notify the enrollee or qualified dependent of any change to the premium due at least thirty days before the change is effective through the process prescribed in subsections B, C, D and E of this section.

G. This section does not apply if continuation coverage benefits are available to enrollees or qualified dependents pursuant to 29 United States Code sections 1161 through 1169 or 42 United States Code sections 300bb-1 through 300bb-8 or if the enrollee or qualified dependent seeking to continue coverage is eligible for medicare.

4. The date on which the employer terminates coverage under the health benefits plan for all employees. If the employer terminates coverage under the health benefits plan for all employees and replaces the plan with coverage under another plan, the enrollee and any qualified dependents who have continuation coverage have the right to become covered under the new plan for the balance of the period that the enrollee or qualified dependent could have remained covered under the continuation coverage.

5. As to a dependent child of the enrollee, the date the dependent child would otherwise lose coverage under the terms of the health benefits plan due to attaining a certain age.

I. A qualified dependent who is determined to have a disability, under title II or title XVI of the social security act, at the time of a qualifying event may be eligible to continue coverage for an additional eleven months if the qualified dependent provides the written determination of disability from the social security administration to the employer within sixty days after the date of that determination and before the end of the eighteen-month continuation period.  The health benefits plan may charge up to one hundred fifty percent of the group rate during the eleven-month disability extension. The qualified dependent shall notify the employer within thirty days after the social security administration determines that the qualified dependent no longer has a disability under title II or title XVI of the social security act.

J. If a qualifying event as defined in subsection N, paragraph 3, subdivision (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section occurs during the eighteen-month continuation period, a qualified dependent may be eligible to continue coverage for an additional eighteen months.

K. If an enrollee is in the military reserve or national guard and is called to active duty and the enrollee's employment is terminated either after or during the active duty period, the termination is a separate qualifying event, distinct from the qualifying event that may have occurred when the enrollee was called to active duty, and the enrollee and any qualified dependent are eligible for a new eighteen-month benefit period beginning on the later of the date active duty ends or the date of employment termination.

L. If an enrollee is in the military reserve or national guard and is called to active duty, the following events are qualifying events distinct from the qualifying event that may have occurred when the enrollee was called to active duty:

2. A divorce or legal separation of the enrollee from the enrollee's spouse occurs.

3. A dependent child ceases to be a dependent child under the requirements of the employer's health benefits plan.

M. Notwithstanding subsection H of this section, if an enrollee who is in the military reserve or national guard has elected to continue coverage and is thereafter called to active duty and the coverage under the employer's health benefits plan is terminated by the enrollee or the health benefits plan due to the enrollee becoming eligible for a health care program provided by the United States department of defense, the eighteen-month period or any other applicable maximum time period for which the enrollee would otherwise be entitled to continuation coverage is tolled during the time that the enrollee is covered under the health care program.  Within sixty-three days after the federal health care program coverage terminates, the enrollee may elect to continue coverage under the employer's health benefits plan retroactively to the date coverage terminated under the federal health care program for the remainder of the eighteen-month period or any other applicable time period, subject to termination of coverage at the earliest of the conditions specified in subsection H of this section.

N. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Enrollee" means an employee who is covered under an employer's health benefits plan for at least three months before a qualifying event.

H. If the policy is under an extended insurance nonforfeiture option, a policy loan provision is not required.

I. Variable life insurance policyholders who exercise their rights under policy loan provisions shall not be disadvantaged by the exercise of those rights.

J. On the exercise of any policy loan provision, the amounts paid to the policyholder shall be withdrawn from the separate account and shall be returned to the separate account on repayment, except that a stock insurer may provide the amounts for policy loans from the general account.

K. A variable life insurance policy or related form that is delivered or issued for delivery in this state may:

1. Include an exclusion for suicide that occurs within two years of the issue date of the policy. If the owner applies for an increase in death benefits after the policy issue date, the policy may provide an exclusion for suicide that occurs within two years of any increase in death benefits to the extent of the increased death benefits only.

2. Offer incidental insurance benefits on a fixed or variable basis.

3. Offer to pay dividend amounts in cash. In addition, the policies may offer the following dividend options:

(a) The amount of the dividend may be credited against premium payments.

(c) The amount of the dividend may be deposited in the general account at a specified minimum rate of interest.

(d) The amount of the dividend may be applied to provide paid-up amounts of fixed benefit one year term insurance.

(e) The amount of the dividend may be deposited as a variable deposit in a separate account.

4. Allow the policyholder to elect in writing an automatic premium loan on a basis that is not less favorable than that required of policy loans under subsection E of this section. The policy may impose a restriction that no more than two consecutive premiums can be paid under the requirements of this paragraph.

5. Allow the policyholder to make partial withdrawals.

6. Include any other policy provision that the director approves.

 

 

#### Section 20-2605. Reserve liabilities for variable life insurance

A. Reserve liabilities for variable life insurance policies shall be established under section 20-510 according to actuarial procedures that recognize the variable nature of the benefits provided and any mortality guarantees.

B. Reserve liabilities for the guaranteed minimum death benefit shall be the reserve amount that is needed to provide for the contingency of death occurring when the guaranteed minimum death benefit exceeds the death benefit that would otherwise be paid in the absence of the guarantee. The insurer shall maintain reserve liabilities in the general account. Reserve liabilities shall not be less than the greater of any of the following minimum reserves:

1. Assuming an immediate one-third depreciation in the current value of the assets in the separate account followed by a net investment return equal to the assumed investment rate, the aggregate total of the term costs on each variable life insurance contract, if any, covering either:

(a) A period of one full year from the valuation date.

(b) If less than the amount under subdivision (a) of this paragraph, the period that is provided for in the guarantee and that is not otherwise provided for by the reserves held in the separate account.

2. The aggregate total of the attained age level reserves on each variable life insurance contract. The attained age level reserve on each variable life insurance contract shall not be less than zero and shall equal the residue of the prior year's attained age level reserve on the contract. Any residue shall be increased or decreased by a payment that is computed on an attained age basis pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph:

(a) The residue of the prior year's attained age level reserve on each variable life insurance contract shall not be less than zero and shall be determined by adding interest at the valuation interest rate to the prior year's reserve, by deducting the tabular claims based on any excess, if any, of the guaranteed minimum death benefit over the death benefit that would be payable in the absence of the guarantee and by dividing the net result by the tabular probability of survival. The excess shall be based on the actual level of death benefits that would have been in effect during the preceding year in the absence of the guarantee and shall take account of the reserve assumptions regarding the distribution of death claim payments over the year.

(b) The payment shall be computed so that the present value of a level payment of that amount each year over the future period for which charges for this risk will be collected under the contract or if no future charges for this risk will be collected under the contract, the payment shall equal (A) minus (B) minus (C). For the purposes of this subdivision:

(i) (A) means the present value of the future guaranteed minimum death benefits.

(ii) (B) means the present value of the future death benefits that would be payable in the absence of the guarantee and that is computed by assuming a net investment return of the separate account that may differ from the assumed investment rate or the valuation interest rate, or both, but that may not exceed the maximum interest rate that is permitted for the valuation of life contracts.

(iii) (C) means any residue as prescribed by subdivision (a) of this paragraph of the prior year's attained age level reserve on the variable life insurance contract.

3. The valuation interest rate and mortality table that are used to compute the guaranteed minimum death benefit and the future death benefit that would be payable in the absence of the guarantee shall conform to permissible standards for the valuation of life insurance contracts. In determining the minimum reserves, the insurer may employ suitable approximations and estimates, including groupings and averages.

C. According to the actuarial procedures appropriate to the benefit, the insurer shall maintain reserve liabilities for all fixed incidental insurance benefits and any guarantees that are associated with variable accidental insurance benefits in the general account and shall maintain reserve liabilities for all variable aspects of the variable incidental insurance benefits in a separate account.

#### Section 20-2606.  Separate accounts

A. A domestic insurer issuing variable life insurance contracts shall establish one or more separate accounts pursuant to section 20-651.  The following apply to the establishment of separate accounts:

1. If no law governs the custody of separate account assets and if the insurer is not the custodian of the separate account assets, all contracts for the custody of the assets shall be in writing and the director may review and approve both the terms of a contract and the proposed custodian before the transfer of custody.

2. Without the director's prior written approval, the insurer shall not employ any person in connection with the handling of separate account assets who within the last ten years either:

assets over $1,070,450,000

until the total of the

                  bonds equals $5,000,000

4. The insurer shall value the assets of the separate accounts at least monthly.

B. The insurer shall maintain in each separate account assets with a value that is at least equal to the greater of the valuation reserves for the variable portion of the variable life insurance policies or the benefit base for the variable life insurance policies.

C. The following apply to investments by the separate account:

1. An insurer or any of its affiliates may not make any sale, exchange or other transfer of assets between any of its separate accounts or between any other investment account and one or more of its separate accounts unless both:

(a) If assets are transferred into a separate account, the transfer is made solely to establish the account or to support the operation of the policies with respect to the separate account to which the transfer is made.

(b) The transfer, whether into or from a separate account, is made by a transfer of cash.  The director may approve the  transfer of other assets in advance of the transfer.

2. The separate account shall have sufficient net investment income and readily marketable assets to meet anticipated withdrawals under the policies that are funded by the account.

D. Except for securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, a separate account shall not purchase or otherwise acquire the securities of any issuer if immediately after the purchase or acquisition the value of the investment, together with any prior investments of the account in the security that is valued pursuant to this article, exceeds ten per cent of the value of the assets of the separate account.  The director may waive this limitation in writing if the director believes that the waiver will not render the operation of the separate account hazardous to the public or to the policyholders in this state.

E. A separate account shall not purchase or otherwise acquire the voting securities of any issuer if as a result of the purchase or acquisition the insurer and its aggregated separate accounts will own more than ten per cent of the issuer's total issued and outstanding voting securities.  The director may waive this limitation in writing if the director believes that the waiver will not render the operation of the separate account hazardous to the public or to the policyholders in this state or jeopardize the independent operation of the issuer of the securities.

F. The ten per cent limitation under subsection D of this section does not preclude the investment of separate account assets in shares of investment companies that are registered pursuant to the investment company act of 1940 (15 United States Code sections 80a-1 through 80a-64) or in other pools of investment assets if the investments and investment policies of the investment companies or asset pools comply substantially with subsection C of this section and with any other applicable provisions under this article.

G. The insurer shall value investments of the separate account at their market value on the date of valuation or at amortized cost if it approximates market value.

H. A domestic insurer shall not change its investment policy of a separate account without first filing the change with the director.  A change that is filed pursuant to this subsection is effective sixty days after the date on which it was filed with the director, unless the director notifies the insurer before the end of the sixty day period of the director's disapproval of the proposed change.  At any time, after notice and a public hearing, the director may disapprove any change that has become effective. The director may disapprove the change if the director determines that the change would be detrimental to the interests of the policyholders who participate in the separate accounts.

I. Before or contemporaneously with the delivery of the policy, the insurer shall disclose to the insured in writing all charges that may be made against the separate account, including the following:

1. Taxes or reserves for taxes that are attributable to investment gains and income of the separate account.

2. Actual cost of reasonable brokerage fees and similar direct acquisition and sale costs that are incurred in the purchase or sale of separate account assets.

3. Actuarially determined tabular costs of insurance and the release of separate account liabilities.

7. Charges for incidental insurance benefits.

J. The board of directors of each insurer that seeks approval to enter into the variable life insurance business in this state shall adopt written standards of conduct relating to the purchase or sale of investments of separate accounts.  The standards of conduct are binding on the insurer and its officers, directors, employees and affiliates.  The adoption of a code of ethics that meets the requirements of section 17j of the investment company act of 1940 satisfies this section.

K. A law that applies to the officers and directors of insurance companies with respect to conflicts of interest also applies to the members of a committee or any other similar body of a separate account.

L. An insurer shall not enter into a contract under which a person for a fee undertakes to regularly furnish investment advice to the insurer with respect to its separate accounts that are maintained for variable life insurance policies unless the contract is in writing, the contract states that the insurer may terminate the contract without penalty to the insurer or the separate account on sixty days' written notice to the investment advisor and one of the following applies:

1. The person who provides the advice is registered as an investment adviser under the investment advisers act of 1940 (15 United States Code sections 80b-1 through 80b-21).

2. The person who provides the advice is an investment manager under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (29 United States Code sections 1001 through 1461) with respect to the assets of each employee benefit plan that are allocated to the separate account.

3. The insurer has filed with the director and continues to file annually the following information and statements concerning the proposed advisor:

(a) The name and form of the organization, the state of organization and the proposed advisor's principal place of business.

(b) The names and addresses of the proposed advisor's partners, officers and directors and of persons who perform similar functions if the investment advisor is an individual.

(c) A written standard of conduct that complies in substance with subsection J of this section.

(d) A statement that is submitted by the proposed advisor to the insurer and that states with respect to each of the following that the proposed advisor or a person associated with the proposed advisor has not:

(i) Within the last ten years been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor offense arising out of such person's conduct as an employee, salesman, officer or director of an insurance company, a banker, an insurance producer, a securities broker or an investment advisor involving embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, the misappropriation of funds or securities or a violation of 18 United States Code section 1341, 1342 or 1343, and arising out of the person's conduct as an employee, salesperson, officer or director of an insurance company or as a banker, insurance producer, securities broker or investment advisor.

(ii) Been permanently or temporarily enjoined by a court order, judgment or decree from acting as an investment advisor, underwriter, broker or dealer, acting as an affiliated person or an employee of an investment company, bank or insurance company or engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with any enjoined activity.

2. A statement of the investment policy of the separate account, including a description of both:

(b) The restrictions or limitations on the manner in which the operations of the separate account will be conducted.

3. A statement of the net investment return of the separate account for each of the last ten years, or if the separate account has been in existence for less than ten years, a statement of the net investment return of the separate account for each of the years that the separate account has been in existence.

4. A statement of the charges that were levied against the separate account during the previous year.

5. A summary of the method the insurer will use in valuing the assets that are held by the separate account.

6. A summary of the federal income tax aspects of the policy that apply to the insured, the policyholder and the beneficiary.

7. Illustrations of benefits that are payable under the variable life insurance contract. The insurer shall prepare the illustrations. The illustrations shall not include projections of past investment experience into the future or attempted predictions of future investment experience. This paragraph does not prohibit the use of hypothetical assumed rates of return to illustrate possible levels of benefits if the illustration makes it clear that the assumed rates are hypothetical only.

B. This section is satisfied if a disclosure that contains the information required by this section is delivered to the applicant. The disclosure shall either:

1. Be a prospectus that satisfies the requirements of the securities act of 1933 (15 United States Code sections 77a through 77aa) and that the securities and exchange commission declares effective.

2. Contain the information and reports that are required by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (29 United States Code sections 1001 through 1461) if the policies are exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of 1933.

#### Section 20-2608. Variable life insurance policy application requirements

A variable life insurance policy application shall contain all of the following:

1. A prominent statement that the death benefit may be variable or fixed under specified conditions.

2. A prominent statement that cash values may increase or decrease according to the investment experience of the separate account.

3. Questions that enable the insurer to determine the suitability of variable life insurance for the applicant.

#### Section 20-2609. Policyholder reports

An insurer that delivers or issues for delivery in this state a variable life insurance policy shall send the following reports to each variable life insurance policyholder:

1. Within thirty days after each anniversary of the policy, a statement or statements of the cash surrender value, the death benefit, any partial withdrawal or policy loan, any interest charge and any optional payments that are allowed under the policy and that are computed as of the policy anniversary date. The statement may be furnished within thirty days after a specified date in each policy year if the information contained in the statement is computed not more than sixty days before the notice is sent. This statement shall state that the cash values and the variable death benefit may increase or decrease according to the investment experience of the separate account and shall prominently identify any value that the statement describes and that may be recomputed before the next statement required by this section. If the policy guarantees that the variable death benefit on the next policy anniversary date will not be less than the variable death benefit specified in the statement, the statement shall be modified to indicate this policy guarantee. In addition, the report must show the projected cash value and cash surrender value, if different, as of one year from the end of the period covered by the report. In determining the projected value, the insurer shall assume that the planned periodic premiums, if any, are paid as scheduled, that the guaranteed costs of insurance are deducted and that the net return is equal to the guaranteed rate, or if there is no guaranteed rate, is not greater than zero. If the projected value is less than zero, the statement shall include a warning message that the policy may be in danger of terminating without value in the next twelve months unless additional premium is paid.

(e) A statement of any change in the investment objective and orientation of the separate account, in any investment restriction or material quantitative or qualitative investment requirement that applies to the separate account or in the investment advisor of the separate account.

3. For flexible premium policies, if the amounts that are available under the policy on any policy processing day to pay the charges that are authorized by the policy are less than the amount necessary to keep the policy in force until the next following policy processing day, a report that indicates the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the policy to keep the policy in force and the length of the grace period for the payment of that amount.

#### Section 20-2610. Foreign companies; compliance with laws of domiciliary state

If the laws of a foreign company's domiciliary state provide a degree of protection to the policyholders and the public that is substantially similar to the degree of protection that is provided by this article, the director may determine that the foreign company has complied with this article.

E. Unless otherwise permitted by law or approved by the director, a company shall not purchase or otherwise acquire for its separate accounts the voting securities of any issuer if as a result of the acquisition the insurance company and its separate accounts, in the aggregate, will own more than ten per cent of the total issued and outstanding voting securities of the issuer.

The director shall approve all variable annuity contracts before they are delivered or issued for delivery in this state.

#### Section 20-2635. Variable annuity contracts

A. A variable annuity that provides benefits payable in variable amounts and that is delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall contain a statement of the essential features of the procedures the insurance company must follow in determining the dollar amount of the variable benefits. The contract, including a group contract and any certificate in evidence of variable benefits that is issued under the contract, shall state that the dollar amount will vary to reflect investment experience and shall contain on its first page a clear statement that the benefits under the contract are on a variable basis.

B. Illustrations of benefits that are payable under a variable annuity shall not include projections of past investment experience into the future or attempted predictions of future investment experience. This subsection does not prohibit the use of hypothetical assumed rates of return to illustrate possible benefit levels.

C. An insurer shall not deliver or issue for delivery in this state an individual variable annuity contract that calls for the payment of periodic stipulated payments unless the contract contains in substance the following provision or provisions:

1. A grace period provision of thirty days or of one month, within which any stipulated payment to the insurer that falls due after the first day may be made and during which the contract shall continue in force. The contract may state the basis for determining the date as of which any payment that is received during the grace period shall be applied to produce the values under the contract arising from the contract.

2. A reinstatement provision that unless the cash surrender value has been paid the contract may be reinstated on the payment to the insurer of the overdue payments as required by contract and all indebtedness on the contract, including interest, at any time after the date of the default in making periodic stipulated payments to the insurer during the life of the annuitant. The contract may state the basis for determining the date as of which the amount to cover the overdue payments and indebtedness shall be applied to produce the values under the contract arising from the contract.

D. A variable annuity contract that is delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall stipulate the investment increment factors the insurer will use in computing the dollar amount of variable benefits or other variable contractual payments or values under the variable annuity contract. The contract may guarantee that expense or mortality results, or both, do not adversely affect the dollar amounts. If the expense and mortality results may adversely affect the dollar amount of benefits, the insurer shall stipulate the expense and mortality factors in the contract. For the purposes of this subsection, the contract may stipulate that expense excludes some or all taxes.

E. In computing the dollar amount of variable benefits or other contractual payments or values under an individual variable annuity contract:

1. Unless the director otherwise approves, the annual net investment increment assumption shall not exceed five per cent.

C. Except pursuant to subsections A and B of this section, if a contract is issued on or after January 1, 1998, a variable annuity contract shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions or corresponding provisions that the director determines are at least as favorable to the contract holder:

The description shall include a statement of the mortality table, if any, and the guaranteed or assumed interest rates that are used in calculating annuity payments.

2. If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity or at any other time, that, on the surrender of the contract at or before the commencement of any annuity payments, the company will pay in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit that is described in the contract and that complies with subsection H of this section. The contract may provide that the company reserves the right to defer the determination and payment of any cash surrender benefit for any period during which the New York stock exchange is closed for trading except for normal holidays or in which the securities and exchange commission determines that a state of emergency exists.

3. A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits that are required by the laws of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which the benefits are altered by any of the following:

(a) The existence of any additional amounts the company credited to the contract.

(b) Any indebtedness to the company on the contract.

(c) Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.

D. The minimum values under this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are available under a variable annuity contract shall be based on nonforfeiture amounts that meet the following requirements:

(b) The amount of any indebtedness on the contract, including interest due and accrued.

(c) An annual contract charge that is not less than zero and that is equal to the lesser of thirty dollars or two per cent of the end of year contract value, less the amount of any annual contract charge that is deducted from any gross considerations credited to the contract during the contract year.

(d) A transaction charge of ten dollars for each transfer to another separate account or to another investment division within the same separate account.

2. The net investment return to be credited to a contract shall be determined at least monthly.

For the purposes of this subsection, "net investment return" means the rate of investment return that is in an amount that does not exceed the actual expense not offset by other deductions and that is credited to the variable annuity contract according to the terms of the contract after deductions for tax charges, if any, for asset charges either at a rate that does not exceed the rate stated in the contract, or if the contract is issued by a nonprofit corporation under which the contract holder participates fully in the investment, for mortality and expense experience of the account.

E. The percentages of net considerations that are used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount under subsection D of this section shall meet one of the following requirements:

The percentages used to calculate the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be as follows:

(a) For the first contract year, sixty-five per cent of the net considerations.

(b) For each renewal contract year, eighty-seven and one-half per cent of the net considerations, except that for any portion of the total net consideration for a renewal contract year that exceeds by not more than two times the sum of those portions of the net considerations in all prior contract years for which the percentage was sixty-five per cent, the percentage to be applied to this amount shall be sixty-five per cent.

2. For contracts that provide for a single consideration, the net consideration that is used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be the gross consideration less a seventy-five dollar contract charge and less any charges for premium taxes. The percentage of the net consideration shall be ninety per cent. The annual thirty dollar contract charge, the collection charge of one dollar twenty-five cents per collection and the seventy-five dollar single consideration contract charge will be adjusted to reflect changes in the consumer price index pursuant to subsection F of this section.

F. A demonstration that a contract's nonforfeiture amounts comply with this section shall be based on the following assumptions, unless the company demonstrates the suitability of alternative assumptions:

1. The testing of values shall occur at the end of each of the first twenty contract years.

8. If the contract provides for the allocation of considerations to both fixed and variable accounts, allocate one hundred per cent of the considerations to the variable account.

G. A paid-up annuity benefit that is available under a variable annuity contract shall be in an amount so that its present value on the annuity commencement date is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on the annuity commencement date. The insurer shall compute the present value by using the mortality table, if any, and the guaranteed or assumed interest rates that are used in calculating the annuity payments.

H. For variable annuity contracts that provide cash surrender benefits, at any time before the annuity commencement date the cash surrender benefit shall not be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount next computed after the company receives the request for surrender. The death benefit under the contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.

I. A variable annuity contract that does not provide cash surrender benefits or that does not provide death benefits that are at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount before the annuity commencement date shall prominently state in the contract that these benefits are not provided.

J. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a variable annuity contract may provide that the company may cancel the annuity and pay the contract holder its accumulated value and that on the payment of its accumulated value the company is released from any further obligation under the contract if either:

1. At the time the annuity becomes payable the accumulated value is less than two thousand dollars, or would provide an income the initial amount of which is less than twenty dollars per month.

2. Before the annuity becomes payable under a periodic payment variable annuity contract, considerations have not been received under the contract for the two full years preceding the cancellation and both:

(a) The considerations were paid before the annuity became payable and were reduced to reflect any partial withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.

(b) The accumulated value amounted to less than two thousand dollars.

K. For a variable annuity contract that provides within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of the cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding subsection D of this section, in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts and paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section, the insurer shall disregard any additional benefits that are payable in the event of a total and permanent disability, as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits or as other policy benefits in addition to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and the considerations for all of the additional benefits. The inclusion of the additional benefits is not required in any paid-up benefits, unless the additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts and paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.

L. For the purposes of this section, "consumer price index" means the index for all urban consumers for all items that is published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor or its successor.

#### Section 20-3211. Contract requirements; execution; rescission; definition

A. A provider entering into a life settlement contract with any owner of a policy in which the insured is terminally ill shall first obtain the following:

1. If the owner is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a settlement contract.

2. A document in which the insured consents to the release of the insured's medical records to a provider, settlement broker or insurance producer and, if the policy was issued less than two years from the date of application for a settlement contract, to the insurance company that issued the policy.

B. The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a provider, settlement broker or life insurance producer not later than thirty calendar days from the date the request is received.  The request for verification of coverage must be made on a form approved by the director.  The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage or indicate in which respects it is unable to respond. In the insurer's response, the insurer shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract.

C. Before or at the time of execution of the settlement contract, the provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner consents to the settlement contract, represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the settlement contract and a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the policy, acknowledges that the owner is entering into the settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a chronic illness or terminal illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a chronic illness or a terminal illness or condition and that the chronic illness or the terminal illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was issued.

D. The insurer shall not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary with any life settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state or with a resident of this state.

E. If a life settlement broker or life insurance producer performs any of these activities required of the provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.

F. If a broker performs the verification of coverage activities required of the provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.

G. Within twenty days after an owner executes the life settlement contract, the provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued the insurance policy that the policy is subject to a life settlement contract. The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by section 20-3204, subsection C.

H. All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee is subject to any applicable law relating to confidentiality of medical information.

I. All life settlement contracts entered into in this state shall provide that the owner may rescind the contract on or before fifteen days after the date it is executed by all parties and the owner has received all required disclosures.  Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid on account of the provider within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest to the provider.

J. Within three business days after receipt from the owner of documents to effect the transfer of the insurance policy, the provider shall pay the proceeds of the settlement to an escrow or trust account managed by a trustee or escrow agent in a state or federally chartered financial institution pending acknowledgment of the transfer by the issuer of the policy.  The trustee or escrow agent shall transfer the proceeds due to the owner within three business days after acknowledgment of the transfer from the insurer.

K. Failure to tender the life settlement contract proceeds to the owner by the date disclosed to the owner renders the contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time the proceeds are tendered to and accepted by the owner.  The failure to give written notice of the right of rescission tolls the right of rescission until thirty days after the written notice of the right of rescission has been given.

L. Any fee paid by a provider, party, individual or owner to a broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life settlement contract shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained and not the face value of the policy. This section does not prohibit a broker from reducing the broker's fee below this percentage if the broker so chooses.

M. The broker shall disclose to the owner anything of value paid or given to a broker that relates to a life settlement contract.

N. At any time before or at the time of the application for or issuance of a policy or during a two-year period commencing with the date of issuance of the policy, a person shall not enter into a life settlement regardless of the date the compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the assignment, transfer, sale, devise, bequest or surrender of the policy is to occur. This prohibition does not apply if:

1. The owner certifies to the provider that the policy was issued on the owner's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy if the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is at least twenty-four months. The time covered under a group policy must be calculated without regard to a change in insurance carriers if the coverage has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship.

2. The owner submits independent evidence to the provider that one or more of the following conditions have been met within the two-year period:

(a) The owner or insured is terminally ill.

(b) The owner or insured disposes of ownership interests in a closely held corporation pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other similar agreement in effect at the time the insurance policy was initially issued.

(c) The owner's spouse dies.

(d) The owner divorces the owner's spouse.

(e) The owner retires from full-time employment.

(f) The owner becomes a person with a physical or mental disability and a physician determines that the disability prevents the owner from maintaining full-time employment.

(g) On the application of a creditor of the owner, a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final order, judgment or decree adjudicating the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the owner or appointing a receiver, trustee or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the owner's assets.

O. The provider shall submit copies of the independent evidence required by subsection N, paragraph 2 of this section when the provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the provider. This section does not prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of any policy.

P. If the provider submits to the insurer a copy of independent evidence as provided in subsection N, paragraph 2, subdivision (a) of this section when the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy to the provider, the copy shall be deemed to establish that the settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section.

Q. An insurer shall not:

1. Engage in any transaction, act or practice that restricts, limits or impairs the lawful transfer of ownership, change of beneficiary or assignment of a policy.

2. Make any false or misleading statement for the purpose of dissuading an owner or insured from a lawful life settlement contract.

R. If there is more than one owner on a single policy and the owners are residents of different states, the life settlement contract shall be governed by the law of the state in which the owner having the largest percentage ownership resides or, if the owners hold equal ownership, the state of residence of one owner agreed on in writing by all of the owners of the policy. The law of the state of the insured shall govern in the event that equal owners fail to agree in writing on a state of residence for jurisdictional purposes.

S. A provider from this state who enters into a life settlement contract with an owner who is a resident of another state that has enacted statutes or adopted rules governing life settlement contracts shall be governed in the effectuation of that life settlement contract by the statutes and rules of the owner's state of residence.  If the state in which the owner is a resident has not enacted statutes or rules governing life settlement contracts, the provider shall give the owner notice that neither state regulates the transaction on which the owner is entering.  For transactions in those states, the provider shall maintain all records required if the transactions were executed in the state of residence. The forms used in those states need not be approved by the department.

T. If there is a conflict in the laws that apply to an owner and a purchaser in any individual transaction, the laws of the state that apply to the owner shall take precedence and the provider shall comply with those laws.

U. It is a fraudulent life settlement act and a violation of this chapter for any person to do any of the following or any of the acts listed in subsection X of this section:

1. Enter into a life settlement contract if a person knows or reasonably should have known that the life insurance policy was obtained by means of a false, deceptive or misleading application for the policy.

2. Engage in any transaction, practice or course of business if a person knows or reasonably should have known that the intent was to avoid the notice requirements of this section.

Article VI

B. Each member of the commission shall have the right and power to cast a vote to which that compacting state is entitled and to participate in the business and affairs of the commission.  A member shall vote in person or by such other means as provided in the bylaws.  The bylaws may provide for members' participation in meetings by telephone or other means of communication.

C. The commission shall meet at least once during each calendar year.  Additional meetings shall be held as set forth in the bylaws.

Article VII

Rules and Operating Procedures, Rulemaking Functions

and Opting Out of Uniform Standards

A. The commission shall adopt reasonable rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. If the commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, the action by the commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.

B. Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the model state administrative procedure act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the commission.  Before the commission adopts a uniform standard, the commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committees in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the uniform standard.  The commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.

C. A uniform standard shall become effective ninety days after its adoption by the commission or such later date as the commission may determine. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard as provided in this article. "Opt out" means any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in an adopted uniform standard.  All other rules and operating procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule, operating procedure or amendment.

D. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by legislation or rule adopted by the insurance department under the compacting state's administrative procedure act. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard by rule, it must:

1. Give written notice to the commission no later than ten business days after the uniform standard is adopted, or at the time the state becomes a compacting state.

2. Find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the state, given the conditions in the state.

E. The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state that warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state. The commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state outweigh both:

1. The intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this compact.

2. The presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant product.

F. A compacting state, at the time of its enactment of the compact, may prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in the compact.  Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of the compact by the compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently adopted.  Pursuant to this subsection, this state opts out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products.

G. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective. Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of that state.  If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under article XIV of this compact for withdrawals.

H. If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the commission, at least fifteen days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success.  If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety days, unless affirmatively extended by the commission.  However, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances that warrant a continuance of the stay, including, the existence of a legal challenge that prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the commission on notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.

I. Not later than thirty days after a rule or operating procedure is adopted, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure.  However, the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the commission's authority.

Article VIII

Commission Records and Enforcement

A. The commission shall adopt rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers' trade secrets. The commission may adopt additional rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.

B. Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any compacting state pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state commissioner of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the commission. Disclosure to the commission does not waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, the commission shall not be subject to the compacting state's laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data and information in its possession. Confidential information of the commission shall remain confidential after the information is provided to any commissioner.

C. The commission shall monitor compacting states for compliance with duly adopted bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures. The commission shall notify any noncomplying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with commission bylaws, rules or operating procedures. If a noncomplying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in article XIV of this compact.

D. The commissioner of any state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise the commissioner's authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the state's law. The commissioner's enforcement of compliance with the compact is governed by the following provisions:

1. With respect to the commissioner's market regulation of a product or advertisement that is approved or certified to the commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the compact except on a final order of the commission, issued at the request of a commissioner after prior notice to the insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the commission.

2. Before a commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or requirement of the compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved or certified to the commission, the commission, or an authorized commission officer or employee, must authorize the action.  Authorization under this paragraph does not require notice to the insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the commission's action on such requests.

Article IX

Dispute Resolution

On the request of a member, the commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to this compact and that may arise between two or more compacting states, or between compacting states and noncompacting states, and the commission shall adopt an operating procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.

Article X

Product Filing and Approval

A. Insurers and third-party filers seeking to have a product approved by the commission shall file the product with, and pay applicable filing fees to, the commission.  This compact does not restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its product with the insurance department in any state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the states where filed.

B. The commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant to commission rules and operating procedures.  The commission shall adopt rules to establish conditions and procedures under which the commission will provide public access to product filing information. In establishing such rules, the commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information, as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be contained in a product filing or supporting information.

C. Any product approved by the commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those compacting states for which the insurer is legally authorized to do business.

Article XI

Review of Commission Decisions Regarding Filings

A. Not later than thirty days after the commission has given notice of a disapproved product or advertisement filed with the commission, the insurer or third-party filer whose filing was disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the commission.  The commission shall adopt rules to establish procedures for appointing the review panels and provide for notice and hearing.  An allegation that the commission, in disapproving a product or advertisement filed with the commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in accordance with article III, subsection D of this compact.

B. The commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider products and advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval on a finding that the product does not meet the relevant uniform standard. Where appropriate, the commission may withdraw or modify its approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in subsection A of this article.

Article XII

Finance

A. The commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the national association of insurance commissioners, compacting states and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the commission concerning the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.

B. The commission shall collect a filing fee from each insurer and third-party filer filing a product with the commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the commission's annual budget.

On the determination of the commission, but no less frequently than every three years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the commission. The commission shall make an annual report to the governor and legislature of the compacting states, which shall include a report of the independent audit.

Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state on enactment of the compact into law by that state.

B. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute.  The withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state unless the approval is rescinded by the withdrawing state as provided in subsection E of this article.

C. The commissioner of the withdrawing state shall immediately notify the management committee in writing on the introduction of legislation repealing the compact in the withdrawing state.

The commission's approval of products and advertisement before the effective date of withdrawal shall continue to be effective and be given full force and effect in the withdrawing state, unless formally rescinded by the withdrawing state in the same manner as provided by the laws of the withdrawing state for the prospective disapproval of products or advertisement previously approved under state law.

F. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur on the effective date of the withdrawing state reenacting the compact.

G. If the commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under the compact, the bylaws or adopted rules or operating procedures, after notice and hearing as set forth in the bylaws, all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by the compact on the defaulting state shall be suspended from the effective date of default as fixed by the commission. The grounds for default include failure of a compacting state to perform its obligations or responsibilities and any other grounds designated in commission rules. The commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the defaulting state's suspension pending a cure of the default. The commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by the compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.

H. Product approvals by the commission or product self-certifications, or any advertisement in connection with such product, that are in force on the effective date of termination shall remain in force in the defaulting state in the same manner as if the defaulting state had withdrawn voluntarily under this article.

I. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires a reenactment of the compact.

J. The compact dissolves effective on the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state that reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.  On the dissolution of the compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.

This privilege is a matter of substantive law of this state and is not merely a procedural matter governing civil proceedings in the courts of this state. The following provisions apply to the privilege:

1. If any company, person or entity performs or directs the performance of an insurance compliance audit, an officer, employee or agent involved with the insurance compliance audit or any consultant who is hired for the purpose of performing the insurance compliance audit may not be examined in any civil or administrative proceeding as to the insurance compliance audit or any insurance compliance audit document.

2. In connection with examinations conducted under this title, an insurer may submit an insurance compliance audit document to the director or the director's designee as a confidential document without waiving the privilege set forth under this subsection to which the insurer would otherwise be entitled.  Any insurance compliance audit document furnished to the director may not be provided by the director to any other person or entity and shall be accorded the same privilege provided under this subsection.

3. If an insurer submits an insurance compliance audit document to the director, the document remains confidential and privileged and:

(a) Is subject to all applicable statutory or common law privileges, including the insurance compliance audit privilege, the work product doctrine, the attorney-client privilege or the subsequent remedial measures exclusion.

(b) Is not subject to any further disclosure or production.

(c) Is not subject to title 39, chapter 1, article 2, not subject to subpoena and not subject to discovery or admissible in a private administrative proceeding or in a private civil action, other than in an administrative proceeding conducted by the director.

4. Disclosure of an insurance compliance audit document to a governmental agency, whether voluntary or pursuant to compulsion of law, does not constitute a waiver of the privilege set forth under this subsection with respect to any other person or governmental agency.

5. The director may obtain insurance compliance audit documents at any time.  The director may use the insurance compliance audit documents in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the director's duties.  The insurer shall comply with any compliance dates set by the director with respect to the insurance compliance audit. Notwithstanding any other law, the director shall provide an insurer with copies of all documents that the director believes support a violation of this title or that justify any regulatory or other action against the insurer.  A disclosure pursuant to this paragraph is not a waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the disclosed documents.

6. In order to facilitate identification, audit documents produced as a result of an insurance compliance audit shall be labeled "compliance report: privileged document".

7. A person who conducts or participates in the preparation of an insurance compliance audit and who has observed physical events may testify regarding those events, but may not be compelled to testify or produce documents related to any privileged part of the insurance compliance audit or any insurance compliance audit document.

8. The insurance compliance audit does not prevent the discovery of a document or other evidence, otherwise discoverable, that is maintained by an insurer and that was not developed for the insurance compliance audit pursuant to this article.

B. The privilege described in this article does not apply to:

1. A document, communication, data or report or other information required by the department or other regulatory agency to be collected, developed, maintained or reported under applicable law.

2. Information obtained by observation, sampling or monitoring by the department or other regulatory agency.

3. Information obtained from a source not involved in the preparation of the insurance compliance audit report.

4. Documents, communications, data, spreadsheets, reports, memoranda, drawings, photographs, exhibits, computer records, maps, charts, graphs, recordings and surveys kept or prepared in the ordinary course of business.

C. If an insurance compliance audit document is obtained, reviewed or used in a criminal proceeding, the privilege described in this article is not waived or eliminated for any other purpose.

D. This article does not provide civil or criminal immunity to an organization or affect any other privilege that may be available by law.

E. The privilege set forth under subsection A of this section does not apply under the following circumstances:

1. To the extent that it is expressly waived by the insurer that prepared or caused to be prepared the insurance compliance audit document.

2. If, after an in camera review, a court of record in a civil or administrative proceeding other than in a regulatory or legal action brought as part of the director's duties determines one of the following:

(a) The privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose.

(b) The document is not subject to the privilege.

(c) The privileged document shows evidence of noncompliance with applicable state or federal laws, rules, regulations or orders of the department and the insurer, person or entity fails to undertake corrective action or eliminate the noncompliance within the compliance date set by the director.

F. Within sixty days after an insurer is served a written request by certified mail for disclosure of an insurance compliance audit document, the insurer may file with the appropriate court a petition requesting a hearing on whether the insurance compliance audit document or portions of the document are privileged under this section or subject to disclosure. The court shall conduct an in camera review of the insurance compliance audit document and shall determine whether all or a portion of the insurance compliance audit document is privileged or subject to disclosure.  The insurer's failure to file a petition for a hearing does not waive the privilege in connection with any other request for disclosure of the insurance compliance audit document. If an insurer files a petition for an in camera hearing pursuant to this subsection, the following apply:

1. The petition shall include all of the information set forth in paragraph 3 of this subsection.

2. After conducting an in camera review, the court may require disclosure of all or a portion of the insurance compliance audit document if the court determines, based on its in camera review, that any one of the conditions set forth in subsection E, paragraph 2 of this section applies. On making this determination, the court may only compel the disclosure of those portions of an insurance compliance audit document that are relevant to issues in dispute in the underlying proceeding.  Any compelled disclosure will not be considered to be a public document or be deemed to be a waiver of the privilege for any other civil or administrative proceeding. An insurer unsuccessfully opposing disclosure may apply to the court for an appropriate order protecting the document from further disclosure.

3. At the time of filing a request for a hearing, the insurer shall provide all of the following information:

(a) The date of the insurance compliance audit document.

(b) The identity of the entity conducting the insurance compliance audit.

(c) The general nature of the activities covered by the insurance compliance audit.

(d) An identification of the portions of the insurance compliance audit document for which the privilege is being asserted.

G. An insurer asserting the insurance compliance privilege set forth under subsection A of this section has the burden of demonstrating the applicability of the privilege. Once an insurer has established the applicability of the privilege, the party seeking disclosure has the burden of proving the inapplicability of the privilege.

H. At any time, the parties to a civil or administrative proceeding other than a regulatory or legal action brought as a part of the director's duties may stipulate to entry of an order directing that specific information contained in an insurance compliance audit document is or is not subject to the privilege provided under subsection A of this section. The stipulation may be limited to the instant proceeding and, absent specific language to the contrary, is not applicable to any other proceeding.

I. This section or the release of any insurance compliance audit document under this section does not limit, waive or abrogate the scope or nature of any statutory or common law privilege including the work product doctrine, the attorney-client privilege or the subsequent remedial measures exclusion.

J. This article does not limit the director's authority under sections 20-156, 20-157, 20-157.01, 20-160 and 20-466.

A. Each health care insurer that issues a health plan in this state shall comply with the mental health parity and addiction equity act.

B. After January 1, 2022, on a date specified by the director, each health care insurer that issues a health plan in this state shall submit a report to the department for each fully insured product network type the health care insurer issues. If the health care insurer determines that the information to be reported varies by network or plan, or varies in the individual, small group or large group market, the health care insurer must submit a report for each variation. Each report must do the following:

1. Describe the process that is used to develop or select the medical necessity criteria for mental health and substance use disorder benefits and the process used to develop or select the medical necessity criteria for medical and surgical benefits.

2. Identify all nonquantitative treatment limits that are applied to mental health and substance use disorder benefits and all nonquantitative treatment limits that are applied to medical and surgical benefits within each classification of benefits.

3. Demonstrate through analysis that for any nonquantitative treatment limit applied to mental health and substance use disorder benefits in a classification of benefits, as written and in operation, any process, strategy, evidentiary standard or other factor used in applying the nonquantitative treatment limit to mental health and substance use disorder benefits in the classification are comparable to, and applied not more stringently than, any process, strategy, evidentiary standard or other factor used in applying the treatment limit for medical and surgical benefits in the classification.

C. In addition to analyzing the reports prescribed in subsection B of this section, the department shall also evaluate health plan compliance with the standards related to financial requirements and quantitative treatment limits described in this section. The department shall perform this analysis during its review of required health care insurer form filings, but may also require a health care insurer to submit additional data relating to its methods for complying with financial requirements and quantitative treatment limit standards. The department may collect and analyze data for each health care insurer's large group plans through a separate, consolidated report.

D. The health plan may not apply any financial requirement or quantitative treatment limit to mental health and substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative treatment limit of that type applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits in the same classification, unless the requirement or treatment limit is modified by one of the following exceptions:

1. Multitiered prescription drug benefits. If a health plan applies different levels of financial requirements to different tiers of prescription drug benefits that are based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the requirements for nonquantitative treatment limits and without regard to whether a drug is generally prescribed with respect to medical and surgical benefits or with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the health plan satisfies the parity requirements of this section with respect to prescription drug benefits.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "reasonable factors" include cost, efficacy, generic versus brand name and mail order versus pharmacy pick up.

2. Multiple network tiers. If a health plan provides benefits through multiple tiers of in-network providers, including an in-network tier of preferred providers with more generous cost sharing to participants than a separate in-network tier of participating providers, the health plan may divide its benefits provided on an in-network basis into subclassifications that reflect network tiers, if the tiering is based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the requirements for nonquantitative treatment limits and without regard to whether a provider provides services with respect to medical and surgical benefits or mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any subclassification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or treatment limit that applies to substantially all medical and surgical benefits in the subclassification.

3. Subclassifications allowed for office visits that are separate from other outpatient services. For the purposes of applying the financial requirements and treatment limits prescribed by this section, a health plan may divide its benefits provided on an outpatient basis into the two subclassifications described in this paragraph. After the subclassifications are established, the health plan or health care insurer may not impose any financial requirement or quantitative treatment limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any subclassification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative treatment limit that applies to substantially all medical and surgical benefits in the subclassification.  Subclassifications for generalists and specialists are prohibited.  Only the following two subclassifications are allowed under this paragraph:

(a) Office and physician visits.

(b) All other outpatient items and services, including outpatient surgery, facility charges for day treatment centers, laboratory charges or other similar medical items.

E. A health insurer shall file the report required by subsection B of this section once every three years.  In years in which the report required by subsection B of this section is not required to be filed, the health care insurer shall file a summary of changes made to the medical necessity criteria and nonquantitative treatment limits and a written attestation that specifies that the health care insurer is in compliance with the mental health parity and addiction equity act.  The department may require the health care insurer to respond to additional questions that are related to the summary of changes or to supply additional data to verify compliance. Three years after the health care insurer submits an original report required by subsection B of this section or an updated or refiled report described in this subsection, the health care insurer may either:

1. File an updated report.

2. Resubmit the health care insurer's currently filed report if the health care insurer files a written attestation to the department that specifies that there have been no changes.

F. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a health care insurer provided the information required by this section in an existing filing or report, the department may not require the health care insurer to submit any additional filing or report. The department is not prohibited from otherwise requesting information or data that is necessary to verify compliance with the mental health parity and addiction equity act or this chapter. The department shall analyze the information required by this section that the health care insurer previously submitted in an existing filing or report to determine compliance with the report required by this section.  The department may establish by rule the terms regarding any required resubmittal of information.

G. All documents, reports or other materials provided to the director pursuant to this section are confidential and are not subject to disclosure. Section 20-157.01, subsection B applies to this section.

The guide must also prominently display a link to the United States department of labor's website, or a related website, that provides information on appeals or complaints by consumers who are covered by self-insured plans that are regulated by the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (P.L. 93-406; 88 Stat. 829).

C.

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any health care insurer that issues a health plan in this state that includes mental health or substance use disorder benefits may not deny any claim for mental health or substance use disorder benefits for a minor solely on grounds that the mental health or substance use disorder service was provided in a school or other educational setting or ordered by a court if the service was provided by an in-network provider or by an out-of-network provider only as allowed by the health plan that covers the subscriber, enrollee or insured.

B. This section does not require a health care insurer to approve a claim or provide reimbursement for a mental health or substance use disorder service provided by an out-of-network provider except as allowed by the health plan that covers the subscriber, enrollee or insured.

C. A health care insurer may require that any mental health or substance use disorder service offered by a mental health provider in an educational setting be provided in a facility or location that is appropriate for the type of service provided and in a manner that complies with applicable laws governing the provision of health care services, including privacy and parental consent laws.

D. Claims for covered mental health or substance use disorder services that are provided by an out-of-network provider and that are not covered by the subscriber's, enrollee's or insured's health plan solely because the provider is an out-of-network provider shall be paid from the children's behavioral health services fund established by section 36-3436.

The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency.  The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount that is less than thirty percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust.

(b) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to subsection F of this section and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as allowed by this subsection or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to subsection F of this section.  It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this subsection that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the insurance commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, on termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account.

(c) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in subsection F of this section are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this subsection, except that such a trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10,000,000.

(d) With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this subsection, if the security is insufficient, the director shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and may impose further reductions in allowable credit on finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.

(e) A certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure one hundred percent of its obligations.  If the director continues to assign a higher rating as allowed by other provisions of this section, this requirement does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.  For the purposes of this subdivision, "terminated" refers to revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender and inactive status.

6. If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in a national association of insurance commissioners accredited jurisdiction, the director may defer to that jurisdiction's certification and to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and the assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.

7. To continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business, a certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status.  An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this subsection, and the director shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business.

H. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer meeting each of the following conditions:

1. The assuming insurer must have its head office or be domiciled in, as applicable, and be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction. A reciprocal jurisdiction is a jurisdiction that meets one of the following:

(a) A non-United States jurisdiction that is subject to an in-force covered agreement with the United States, each within its legal authority, or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and the European Union, that is a member state of the European Union.

(b) A United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the national association of insurance commissioners financial standards and accreditation program.

(c) A qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the director pursuant to subsection G, paragraph 3 of this section that is not otherwise described in subdivision (a) or (b) of this paragraph and that meets certain additional requirements, consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements, as specified by the director in rule.

2. The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be prescribed in rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to be prescribed in rule.

3. The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, that is prescribed in rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer has its head office or is domiciled, as applicable, and is also licensed.

4. The assuming insurer must agree and provide adequate assurance to the director, in a form specified by the director pursuant to rule, as follows:

(a) The assuming insurer must provide a prompt written notice and explanation to the director if it falls below the minimum requirements prescribed in paragraph 2 or 3 of this subsection or if any regulatory action is taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law.

(b) The assuming insurer must consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state and to the appointment of the director as agent for service of process. The director may require that consent for service of process be provided to the director and included in each reinsurance agreement. This subdivision does not limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, except to the extent such agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws.

(c) The assuming insurer must consent in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer or its legal successor, that have been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction where the judgment was obtained.

(d) Each reinsurance agreement must include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained or a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate.

(e) The assuming insurer must confirm that it is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement that involves this state's ceding insurers, and agree to notify the ceding insurer and the director and to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding insurer, should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of arrangement. The security shall be in a form that is consistent with the requirements prescribed in subsection G of this section and section 20-3603 and as specified by the director in rule.

5. If requested by the director, the assuming insurer or its legal successor must provide on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors certain documentation to the director as specified by the director in rule.

6. The assuming insurer must maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria prescribed in rule.

7. The assuming insurer's supervisory authority must confirm to the director on an annual basis, as of the preceding December 31 or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements prescribed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this subsection.

8. The assuming insurer may provide the director with additional information on a voluntary basis.

I. The director:

1. Shall timely create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions that includes any reciprocal jurisdiction prescribed in subsection H, paragraph 1, subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section and shall consider including any other reciprocal jurisdiction included on the national association of insurance commissioners list of reciprocal jurisdictions published through the national association of insurance commissioners committee process. The director may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the national association of insurance commissioners list of reciprocal jurisdictions in accordance with criteria to be developed under rules issued by the director.

2. May remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions on a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction, in accordance with a process prescribed in rules issued by the director, except that the director shall not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction prescribed in subsection H, paragraph 1, subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section.  On removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from the list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that has its home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed, if otherwise allowed by law.

3. Shall timely create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions prescribed in this section and to which cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with this section. The director may add an assuming insurer to the list if a national association of insurance commissioners accredited jurisdiction has added the assuming insurer to a list of such assuming insurers or if, on initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the information to the director as required under subsection H, paragraph 4 of this section and complies with any additional requirements that the director may impose by rule, except to the extent that they conflict with an applicable covered agreement.

4. May revoke or suspend the eligibility of an assuming insurer for recognition under this subsection in accordance with procedures prescribed in rule, if the director determines that the assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements under this section. While the assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, a reinsurance agreement issued, amended or renewed after the effective date of the suspension does not qualify for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with section 20-3603. If the assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, credit for reinsurance may not be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into before the date of revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the director and are consistent with the parameters prescribed in section 20-3603.

J. If subject to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation or conservation, as applicable, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming insurer post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.

K. Subsection H of this section does not:

1. Limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by this article or another applicable law or rule.

2. Authorize an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement except as allowed by the terms of the agreement.

3. Limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate the agreement.

L. Credit may be taken under subsection H of this section only for reinsurance agreements entered into, amended or renewed on or after September 29, 2021, and only with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported on or after the later of the date on which the assuming insurer has met all eligibility requirements pursuant to subsection H of this section and the effective date of the new reinsurance agreement, amendment or renewal. This subsection does not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this section, as long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision of this article.

M. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of subsection C, D, E, F, G or H of this section, but only as to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions where the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction.

N. If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the credit allowed by subsections E and F of this section may not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements:

1. That if the assuming insurer fails to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, will submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, will comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction and will abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal.  This subsection is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if this obligation is created in the agreement.

2. To designate the director or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney on whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding insurer.

O. If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements prescribed in subsection C, D, E or H of this section, the credit allowed by subsection F or G of this section may not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:

1. Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because it contains an amount that is less than the amount required by subsection F, paragraph 5 of this section, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of its state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund.

2. The assets shall be distributed by and claims shall be filed with and valued by the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies.

3. If the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part of the assets are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets or part of the assets shall be returned by the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight to the trustee for distribution in accordance with the trust agreement.

4. The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to it under United States law that is inconsistent with this subsection.

P. If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for accreditation or certification, the director may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's accreditation or certification, and the following apply:

1. The director must give the reinsurer notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The suspension or revocation may not take effect until after the director's order on the hearing, unless either:

(a) The reinsurer waives its right to a hearing.

(b) The director's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer under subsection G, paragraph 6 of this section.

(c) The director finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the director's action.

2. While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, a reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension does not qualify for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with section 20-3603. If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, a credit for reinsurance may not be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subsection G, paragraph 5 of this section or section 20-3603.

Q. A ceding insurer shall take steps to:

1. Manage its reinsurance recoverables proportionate to its own book of business. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the director within thirty days after reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, exceed fifty percent of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to policyholders, or after it is determined that reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, are likely to exceed this limit. The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.

2. A ceding insurer shall take steps to diversify its reinsurance program. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the director within thirty days after ceding to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, more than twenty percent of the ceding insurer's gross written premium in the prior calendar year, or after it has determined that the reinsurance ceded to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, is likely to exceed this limit.  The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.

R. For the purposes of this section, "covered agreement" means an agreement that is entered into pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform and consumer protection act (31 United States Code sections 313 and 314), that is currently in effect or in a period of provisional application and that addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this state or for allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance.

#### Section 20-3603. Asset or reduction from liability for reinsurance ceded by a domestic insurer to an assuming insurer

A. An asset or a reduction from liability for the reinsurance ceded by a domestic insurer to an assuming insurer that does not meet the requirements of section 20-3602 shall be allowed in an amount not exceeding the liabilities carried by the ceding insurer.  The director may adopt by rule pursuant to section 20-3604, subsection B specific additional requirements relating to or prescribing any or all of the following:

1. The valuation of assets or reserve credits.

2. The amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in subsection B of this section.

3. The circumstances pursuant to which credit will be reduced or eliminated.

B. The reduction shall be in the amount of funds held by or on behalf of the ceding insurer, including funds held in trust for the ceding insurer, under a reinsurance contract with the assuming insurer as security for the payment of obligations thereunder, if the security is held in the United States subject to withdrawal solely by, and under the exclusive control of, the ceding insurer or, in the case of a trust, held in a qualified United States financial institution as defined in section 20-3601, subsection B. This security may be in the form of:

#### Section 20-3654. Exceptions; process

A. Notwithstanding any other law, if coverage of a prescription drug for the treatment of any medical condition is restricted for use by a health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent through the use of a step therapy protocol, the patient and prescribing provider shall have access to a clear and convenient process to request a step therapy exception determination. A health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent may use its existing medical exceptions process to satisfy this requirement if that process is consistent with the requirements prescribed in section 20-3653 and this section.  The process shall be made easily accessible on the health care insurer's, health benefit plan's, pharmacy benefit manager's or utilization review agent's website and shall include a list of the information and documentation the health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent requires and where and to whom the patient and prescribing provider must send the step therapy exception request.

B. A step therapy exception request shall be granted if sufficient justification and any necessary supporting clinical documentation are submitted to establish that any of the following applies:

1. The prescription drug required by the step therapy protocol is contraindicated or will likely cause a serious adverse reaction by or physical or mental harm to the patient.

2. The prescription drug required by the step therapy protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known clinical characteristics of the patient and the known characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.

3. The patient has tried the prescription drug required by the step therapy protocol while under the patient's current or previous health care plan, or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class with a similar efficacy and side effect profile or with the same mechanism of action, the patient's adherence during the trial was for a period of time sufficient to allow for a positive treatment outcome and the prescription drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness, an adverse event or contraindication.

4. The prescription drug required by the step therapy protocol is not in the best interest of the patient based on medical necessity because the patient's use of the prescription drug is expected to cause any of the following:

(a) A barrier to the patient's adherence to or compliance with the patient's plan of care.

(b) A negative impact on the patient's comorbid conditions.

(c) A clinically predictable negative drug interaction.

5. The patient has experienced a positive therapeutic outcome on a prescribed drug selected by the patient's health care provider for the medical condition under consideration while on the patient's current or previous health care plan. A health care provider may not use a pharmaceutical sample for the purpose of qualifying for an exception to step therapy under this paragraph.

C. On granting a step therapy exception determination, the health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent shall authorize coverage for the prescription drug prescribed by the patient's treating health care provider if the prescription drug is covered by the patient's health care plan.

D. The health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent shall grant or deny a step therapy exception request within seventy-two hours after receiving the request. In a case in which an exigent circumstance exists, the health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent shall grant or deny the step therapy exception request within twenty-four hours after receiving the request.  If the step therapy exception request is incomplete or additional clinically relevant information is required, the health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent shall notify the prescribing provider within seventy-two hours after receiving the request, or within twenty-four hours if an exigent circumstance exists, that additional or clinically relevant information is required in order to approve or deny the step therapy exception request pursuant to the requirements outlined in subsection A of this section.  The health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent shall grant or deny the step therapy exception request within seventy-two hours after receiving the requested additional or clinically relevant information, or within twenty-four hours if an exigent circumstance exists.  If the prescribing provider does not receive a determination or request for additional or clinically relevant information from the health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent within the time period prescribed by this subsection, the exception is deemed granted.

E. An insured, enrollee or subscriber may appeal an adverse step therapy exception determination as prescribed in chapter 15, article 2 of this title.

F. This section does not prevent either of the following:

1. A health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent from requiring a patient to try an AB-rated generic equivalent before providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription drug.

2. A health care provider from prescribing a prescription drug that is determined to be medically necessary.
