All monies received by the director from any such sale or resale shall revert to the general fund.

#### Section 20-169. Supervision by director

Notwithstanding any other law, if on examination pursuant to this article or at any other time it appears to or is in the opinion of the director that any insurance company is insolvent, or its condition is such as to render the continuance of its business hazardous to the public or to holders of its policies or certificates of insurance, or if the insurance company appears to have exceeded its powers or has failed to comply with the law, or if the insurance company gives its consent, the director, on the director's determination, shall do all of the following:

1. Notify the insurance company of the director's determination.

2. Furnish to the insurance company a written list of the director's requirements to abate the determination.

3. If the director makes a further determination to supervise, the director shall notify the insurance company that it is under the supervision of the department of insurance and financial institutions and that the director is applying and effecting the provisions of this article. The insurance company shall comply with the lawful requirements of the director and, if placed under supervision, shall under supervision have sixty days from the date of notice within which to comply with the requirements of the director, subject to the provisions of this article. If the insurance company fails to comply within such time, the director, or a conservator appointed by the director for that purpose, shall immediately, after due and proper notice and hearing, take charge as conservator of the insurance company and all of the property and effects of the insurance company.

#### Section 20-170. Prohibited acts during sixty day period of supervision

During the period of supervision, the director may appoint a supervisor to supervise such insurance company and may provide that the insurance company may not do any of the following things, during the period of supervision, without the prior approval of the director or his supervisor:

1. Dispose of, convey or encumber any of its assets or its business in force;

2. Withdraw any of its bank accounts;

3. Lend any of its funds;

4. Invest any of its funds;

5. Transfer any of its property;

6. Incur any debt, obligation or liability;

7. Merge or consolidate with another company; or

8. Enter into any new reinsurance contract or treaty.

#### Section 20-171. Conservatorship; liquidation

A. If, after notice, and after hearing, at the conclusion of the sixty day period, it is determined that such insurance company has failed to comply with the lawful requirements of the director or upon consent by an insurance company, the director may appoint a conservator, who shall immediately take charge of such insurance company and all of the property, books, records, and effects thereof, and conduct the business thereof, and take such steps toward the removal of the causes and conditions, which have necessitated such order, as the director may direct. During the pendency of conservatorship, the conservator shall make such reports to the director from time to time as may be required by the director and shall be empowered to take all necessary measures to preserve, protect, and recover any assets or property of such insurance company, including claims or causes of action belonging to or which may be asserted by such insurance company, and to deal with the same in his own name as conservator, and shall be empowered to file, prosecute, and defend any suit or suits which have been filed or which may thereafter be filed by or against such insurance company which are deemed by the conservator to be necessary to protect all of the interested parties or any property affected thereby. If at the time of appointment of a conservator or at any time during the pendency of such conservatorship it appears that the interest of the policyholders or certificate holders of such insurance company can best be protected by reinsuring the same, the conservator may, with the approval of or at the direction of the director:

1. Reinsure all or any part of such insurance company's policies or certificates of insurance with some solvent insurance company authorized to transact business in this state, and

2. To the extent that such insurance company in conservatorship is possessed of reserves attributable to such policies or certificates of insurance, the conservator may transfer to the reinsuring company such reserves or any portion thereof as may be required to consummate the reinsurance of such policies, and any such reserves so transferred shall not be deemed a preference of creditors.

B. If the director is satisfied that such insurance company is not in condition to continue business in the interest of its policy or certificate holders, under the conservator as above provided, the director shall give notice to the attorney general who shall thereupon apply to any court in Arizona having jurisdiction thereof for leave to file a suit in the nature of quo warranto to forfeit the certificate of authority of such insurance company or to require it to comply with the law or to satisfy the director as to its solvency, and to satisfy the requirement that its condition is such as to render the continuance of its business not hazardous to the public or to the holders of its policies or certificates of insurance. It shall be in the discretion of the director to determine whether or not he will operate the insurance company through a conservator, or report it to the attorney general. When all the policies of an insurance company are reinsured or terminated, and all of its affairs concluded, the director shall report the same to the attorney general, who shall take such action as may be necessary to effect the forfeiture or cancellation of the certificate of authority of the insurance company so reinsured and liquidated. Where the director lends his approval to the merger, consolidation or reinsurance of all the policies of one insurance company with that of another, the same shall be reported to the attorney general who shall proceed to effect the forfeiture or cancellation of the certificate of authority of the insurance company from which the policies were merged, consolidated or reinsured, in the same manner as is provided for the charters of companies totally reinsured or liquidated.

C. The cost incident to the supervisor's and conservator's service shall be fixed and determined by the director and shall be a charge against the assets and funds of the insurance company to be allowed and paid as the director may determine.

 

#### Section 20-172. Possession by director of person transacting insurance prior to appointment of receiver; powers of director in possession; stay of possession order; application to title insurance

A. The director may, upon submission of a verified petition stating that an insurer is in such an unsafe or unsound condition that it is or will become unable to meet the anticipated demands of its policyholders and that the condition cannot be corrected by the procedures of sections 20-169, 20-170 or 20-171, obtain an order from the superior court allowing the director to immediately take possession and control of the insurer pending a hearing on the appointment of a receiver. The superior court shall immediately consider the director's petition and shall immediately issue without notice to the affected party such order unless the verified petition filed by the director is faulty. After the order is granted, the director shall immediately, through the attorney general, apply to the superior court for the appointment of a receiver for the insurer. If at any time the court finds that no ground for receivership exists, the receivership shall be dissolved and the director's possession terminated.

B. When the director has taken possession of an insurer and until either the appointment and qualification of the receiver or the adjudication that no ground for the receivership exists, the director shall be vested with the full and exclusive power of management and control. The director shall have the power to continue or to discontinue the business, to stop or to limit the payment of its obligations, to employ any necessary assistants, to execute any instrument in the name of the insurer and to commence, defend and conduct in its name any action or proceeding in which the insurer may be a party.

C. An order issued by the director pursuant to this section shall not be stayed except by order of the superior court and upon the giving of security by the applicant in such sum as will be adequate to protect the insurer's policyholders.

D. The provisions of this section shall apply to all types of insurers including title insurers, hospital service corporations, medical service corporations, dental service corporations, optometric service corporations, and health care service organizations.

#### Section 20-173. Residence requirement; exemption for officer representing insurer

Notwithstanding the provision of section 38-201, subsection A, to the contrary, a member of a guaranty fund board established pursuant to this title, chapter 3, article 6 or 7, who is appointed to represent an insurer or group of insurers, need not be a resident of this state.

### Article 3 - Mandated Health Coverage

#### Section 20-181. Mandated health coverage; report

An organization or individual advocating a legislative proposal that would mandate a health coverage or offering of a health coverage by an insurer, hospital, medical, dental or optometric service corporation, health care services organization or any other health care service contractor as a component of individual or group policies shall submit a report pursuant to section 20-183.Â  The report shall assess both the social and financial impacts of such coverage, including the effectiveness of the treatment or service proposed, according to the factors prescribed in section 20-182.

 

#### Section 20-182. Factors for assessing impact; certification of report

A. To the extent that information is available, the report prescribed by section 20-181 shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

1. The social impact:

(a) The extent to which the treatment or service is generally utilized by a significant portion of the population.

(b) The extent to which the insurance coverage is already generally available.

(c) If coverage is not generally available, the extent to which the lack of coverage results in persons avoiding necessary health care treatments.

(d) If the coverage is not generally available, the extent to which the lack of coverage results in unreasonable financial hardship to a patient.

(e) The level of public demand for the treatment or service.

(f) The level of public demand for insurance coverage of the treatment or service.

(g) The level of interest of collective bargaining agents in negotiating privately for inclusion of this coverage in group contracts.

2. The financial impact:

(a) The extent to which the coverage will increase or decrease the cost of the treatment or service.

(b) The extent to which the coverage will increase the appropriate use of the treatment or service.

(c) The extent to which the mandated treatment or service will be a substitute for a more expensive treatment or service.

(d) The extent to which the coverage will increase or decrease the administrative expenses of insurers and the premium and administrative expenses of policyholders.

(e) The impact of this coverage on the total cost of health care.

B. An actuary who is a member of the American academy of actuaries shall prepare the financial impact analysis required by subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section and certify that the analysis is consistent with accepted actuarial techniques.

C. The report required by section 20-181 shall address the specific language of the proposed mandate.Â  A report on a similar proposal in a different jurisdiction is insufficient and does not meet the requirements of section 20-181.

D. An organization, individual or legislator that does not submit a report required by section 20-181 is not subject to any civil sanction or criminal penalty.

 

#### Section 20-183. Report procedures and deadlines

A person or a legislator advocating a legislative proposal pursuant to section 20-181 shall submit a written report explaining the factors prescribed in section 20-182 to the joint legislative audit committee established by section 41-1279.Â  The report must be submitted on or before September 1 before the start of the legislative session for which the legislation is proposed. The joint legislative audit committee shall assign the written report to the appropriate legislative committee of reference established pursuant to section 41-2954. The legislative committee of reference shall hold at least one hearing and take public testimony after receiving the report. The legislative committee of reference shall study the written report and deliver a report of its recommendations to the joint legislative audit committee, the speaker of the house of representatives, the president of the senate, the governor and the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions on or before December 1 of the year in which the report is submitted.

### Article 4 - Payment of Premiums

#### Section 20-191. Payment of premiums by mail; date of payment

A. Any payment of insurance premium that is deposited, properly addressed and postage prepaid, in an official depository of the United States mail on or before the date the premium is due is deemed timely payment of the premium on the date shown by the postmark or other official mark of the United States mail stamped on the payment envelope. An insurer may establish the postmark date by retaining the postmarked payment envelope. If the insurer does not retain the envelope or the postmark date on the envelope is illegible, the payment date is presumed to be five mail days before the date the insurer receives the payment. An insurer may establish the date of receipt by a record generated in the course of regularly conducted business. For the purposes of this subsection, "mail days" means days on which the United States postal service performs regular mail delivery.

B. If a payment described in subsection A is sent by United States certified or registered mail or certificate of mailing, the date of the registration, certification or certificate, as established by a record authenticated by proper officials of the United States mail, is deemed the date of payment.

C. If the due date of a payment described in subsection A falls on a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, the payment is considered timely if sent on the next business day.

B. A domestic insurer, including a domestic limited stock insurer subject to the capital and surplus requirements prescribed in subsection D of this section, holding a valid certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of the kind or kinds as set forth in subsection A prior to the effective date of this section, may, if otherwise qualified, continue to be so authorized while possessing the amount of paid-in capital stock, if a stock insurer, or surplus, if a mutual insurer, required by the laws of this state for such authority immediately prior to the effective date of this section. The director shall not grant such an insurer authority to transact any other or additional kinds of insurance unless such insurer fully complies with the requirements as to capital and surplus, as applied to all kinds of insurance which the insurer proposes to transact, as provided by this section for like insurers applying for original certificates of authority under this title. Upon a change in the control of such an insurer, such insurer shall within one year from the effective date of such change in control meet the capital and surplus requirements for new insurers pursuant to subsection A of this section.

1. Minimum paid-in capital stock of one hundred thousand dollars, and

2. Surplus funds in an amount of not less than one-half such minimum paid-in capital. On and after the effective date of this section any domestic limited stock insurer which holds a valid certificate of authority immediately prior to such effective date and which qualified under the provisions of subsection B of section 20-708 and whose premium income as a direct writer during calendar year 1976 did not exceed fifty per cent of its total premium income including reinsurance premiums from insurance policies and contracts for such year, shall be a domestic life and disability reinsurer and be subject to the provisions of article 10, of chapter 4 of this title.

#### Section 20-211. Surplus required

A. In addition to the minimum required capital stock, if a stock insurer, or minimum required basic surplus, if mutual or reciprocal insurers, as required by sections 20-210 and 20-212 as to all stock insurers and foreign and alien mutual and reciprocal insurers, by sections 20-768 and 20-212 as to domestic reciprocal insurers, and section 20-711, subsection B and section 20-212 as to domestic mutual insurers, except as stated in subsection C of this section, any foreign or alien insurer, any title insurer, and any domestic insurer shall possess at the time of original authorization in this state initial free surplus as stated in section 20-210, and shall maintain free surplus funds in an amount of not less than one-half such initial free surplus.

For the purposes of this section and section 41-1525:

1. A tax credit is not allowed against the portion of the tax payable to the fire fighters' relief and pension fund pursuant to section 20-224 or the portion of the tax payable to the public safety personnel retirement system pursuant to section 20-224.01.

B. Subject to subsection F of this section, the amount of the tax credit is equal to:

1. $3,000 for each full-time employee hired in a qualified employment position in the first year or partial year of employment.Â  Employees hired in the last ninety days of the taxable year are excluded for that taxable year and are considered to be new employees in the following taxable year.

2. $3,000 for each full-time employee in a qualified employment position for the full taxable year in the second year of continuous employment.

3. $3,000 for each full-time employee in a qualified employment position for the full taxable year in the third year of continuous employment.

C. The capital investment and the new qualified employment positions requirements of section 41-1525, subsection B must be accomplished within twelve months after the start of the required capital investment.Â  A credit may not be claimed until both requirements are met. A business that meets the requirements of section 41-1525, subsection B for a location is eligible to claim first year credits for three years beginning with the taxable year in which those requirements are completed. Employees hired at the location before the beginning of the taxable year but during the twelve-month period allowed in this subsection are considered to be new employees for the taxable year in which all of those requirements are completed.

1. The employee is hired after the start of the required investment at the designated location.

3. The payroll for the employees destined for the designated location is segregated from other employees.

F. The net increase in the number of qualified employment positions is the lesser of the total number of filled qualified employment positions created at the designated location or locations during the taxable year or the difference between the average number of full-time employees in this state in the current taxable year and the average number of full-time employees in this state during the immediately preceding taxable year.Â  The net increase in the number of qualified employment positions computed under this subsection may not exceed the difference between the average number of full-time employees in this state in the current taxable year and the average number of full-time employees in this state during the immediately preceding taxable year.

G. If the allowable tax credit exceeds the state premium tax liability, the amount of the claim not used as an offset against the state premium tax liability may be carried forward as a tax credit against subsequent years' state premium tax liability for a period not exceeding five taxable years.

H. If the business is sold or changes ownership through reorganization, stock purchase or merger, the new taxpayer may claim first year credits only for the qualified employment positions that it created and filled with an eligible employee after the purchase or reorganization was complete. If a person purchases a taxpayer that had qualified for first or second year credits or if an insurance business changes ownership through reorganization, stock purchase or merger, the new taxpayer may claim the second or third year credits if it meets other eligibility requirements of this section. Credits for which a taxpayer qualified before the changes described in this subsection are terminated and lost at the time the changes are implemented.

J. A failure to timely report and certify to the Arizona commerce authority the information prescribed by section 41-1525, subsection E and in the manner prescribed by section 41-1525, subsection F disqualifies the insurer from the credit under this section. The department of insurance and financial institutions shall require written evidence of the timely report to the Arizona commerce authority.

K. A tax credit under this section is subject to recovery for a violation described in section 41-1525, subsection H.

L. The department may adopt rules necessary for the administration of this section.

M. For the purposes of subsection B, paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section, if a full-time employee in the qualified employment position leaves during the taxable year, the employee may be replaced with another new full-time employee in the same employment position and the new employee will be treated as being in the employee's second or third full year of continuous employment for the purposes of the credit under this section if both of the following apply:

1. The total time the position was vacant from the date the employment position was originally filled to the end of the current tax year totals ninety days or less.

2. The new employee meets all of the same requirements as the original employee was required to meet.

1. Does not affect the legal effectiveness, validity or enforceability of a notice or document delivered by electronic means to the party before the withdrawal of consent is effective.

2. Is effective within seven days after the insurer receives the withdrawal.

N. If a party's consent to receive certain notices or documents in an electronic format is on file with an insurer before July 24, 2014 and the insurer intends to deliver additional notices or documents to that party in an electronic format pursuant to this section, before delivering the additional notices or documents electronically the insurer must notify the party of both of the following:

A. Every insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies shall make available to the named insured thereunder and by written notice offer the named insured and at the request of the named insured shall include within the policy uninsured motorist coverage that extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy, in limits not less than the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the policy. The offer of limits to a named insured or applicant shall be made on a form approved by the director. An insurance producer that uses such a form in offering uninsured motorist coverage satisfies the insurance producer's standard of care in offering and explaining the nature and applicability of uninsured motorist coverage. The policy declarations page must be sent to the named insured, constitutes the final expression of the named insured's decision to purchase or reject uninsured motorist coverage and is valid for, extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy. An offer form is not required where the named insured purchases such coverage in an amount equal to the limits for bodily injury or death contained in the policy.Â  The offer need not be made in the event of the reinstatement of a lapsed policy or the transfer, substitution, modification or renewal of an existing policy or as a result of a change to the minimum liability limits for bodily injury or death prescribed in section 28-4009. At the request of the named insured, the named insured may purchase and the insurer shall then include within the policy uninsured motorist coverage that extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy in any amount up to the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the policy but not less than the limits prescribed in section 28-4009.

B. Every insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies shall also make available to the named insured thereunder and shall by written notice offer the named insured and at the request of the named insured shall include within the policy underinsured motorist coverage that extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy, in limits not less than the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the policy. The offer of limits to a named insured or applicant shall be made on a form approved by the director. An insurance producer that uses such a form in offering underinsured motorist coverage satisfies the insurance producer's standard of care in offering and explaining the nature and applicability of underinsured motorist coverage. The policy declarations page must be sent to the named insured, constitutes the final expression of the named insured's decision to purchase or reject underinsured motorist coverage and is valid for, extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy. An offer form is not required where the named insured purchases such coverage in an amount equal to the limits for bodily injury or death contained in the policy. The offer need not be made in the event of the reinstatement of a lapsed policy or the transfer, substitution, modification or renewal of an existing policy or as a result of a change to the minimum liability limits for bodily injury or death prescribed in section 28-4009. At the request of the named insured, the named insured may purchase and the insurer shall then include within the policy underinsured motorist coverage that extends to and covers all persons insured under the policy in any amount authorized by the insured up to the liability limits for bodily injury or death contained within the policy.

C. Any insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies may make available the coverages required by subsections A and B of this section to owners and operators of motor vehicles that are used as public or livery conveyances or rented to others or that are used in the business primarily to transport property or equipment. Subsections A and B of this section do not preclude an insurer writing automobile liability or motor vehicle liability policies in this state from requiring that all motor vehicles that are owned by or registered to the named insured and that are insured by the same insurer or group of insurers under a common management have the same limits of coverage for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage in amounts as selected or rejected by the named insured.

D. "Uninsured motor vehicles", subject to the terms and conditions of that coverage, includes any insured motor vehicle if the liability insurer of the vehicle is unable to make payment on the liability of its insured, within the limits of the coverage, because of insolvency.

E. "Uninsured motorist coverage", subject to the terms and conditions of that coverage, means coverage for damages due to bodily injury or death if the motor vehicle that caused the bodily injury or death is not insured by a motor vehicle liability policy that contains at least the limits prescribed in section 28-4009. For the purposes of uninsured motorist coverage, an uninsured motorist does not include a person who is insured under a motor vehicle liability policy that complies with section 28-4009.

F. Any payment made under the bodily injury liability portion of a motor vehicle liability policy insuring the motor vehicle that caused the bodily injury or death in an amount equal to or less than the per person or per occurrence bodily injury limits of that policy, regardless of the number of persons receiving payments, precludes any payment under the uninsured motorist coverage based on the fault of the person who is insured under the motor vehicle liability policy.

G. "Underinsured motorist coverage" includes coverage for a person if the sum of the limits of liability under all bodily injury or death liability bonds and liability insurance policies applicable at the time of the accident is less than the total damages for bodily injury or death resulting from the accident. To the extent that the total damages exceed the total applicable liability limits, the underinsured motorist coverage provided in subsection B of this section is applicable to the difference.

H. Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages are separate and distinct and apply to different accident situations. Underinsured motorist coverage shall not provide coverage for a claim against an uninsured motorist in addition to any applicable uninsured motorist coverage. If multiple policies or coverages purchased by one insured on different vehicles apply to an accident or claim, the insurer may limit the coverage so that only one policy or coverage, selected by the insured, shall be applicable to any one accident. If the policy does not contain a statement that informs the insured of the insured's right to select one policy or coverage as required by this subsection, within thirty days after the insurer receives notice of an accident, the insurer shall notify the insured in writing of the insured's right to select one policy or coverage. For the purposes of this subsection, "insurer" includes every insurer within a group of insurers under a common management.

I. Insurers that make payments for damages to insureds for uninsured motorist coverage may subrogate and sue for reimbursement of the total amount of the payments in the name of the insured against any uninsured motorist responsible for the damages to the insured.

J. Any automobile liability or motor vehicle liability insurer that makes a payment under the medical payments coverage of a motor vehicle insurance policy to or on behalf of any insured for an injury that arises out of an accident that occurs after December 31, 1998 may have a lien against any amount in excess of $5,000 that is paid to or on behalf of that insured under the medical payments coverage of the policy for that accident. The insurer shall compromise the lien in a fair and equitable manner. In order to perfect a lien granted pursuant to this subsection, within sixty days after issuing a payment that is more than $5,000 to the insured under medical payments coverage, the insurer or the insurer's authorized representative shall record in the office of the recorder of the county in which the accident occurred a written statement that sets forth the name and address of the insured as they appear in the records of the insurer, the name and address of the insurer at the insurer's principal office in this state, the amount claimed pursuant to this subsection and, to the best of the insurer's knowledge, the names and addresses of all persons, firms and corporations and their insurance carriers that the insured or the insured's legal representative alleges are liable for damages arising from the accident. Within five days after recording the lien, the insurer shall also mail a copy of the lien, postage prepaid, to the insured and to each person, firm and corporation and their insurance carriers alleged to be liable for damages at the address given in the statement. The recording of the lien is notice of the lien to all persons, firms and corporations that are liable for damages regardless of whether they are named in the lien. The recorder shall endorse on the lien recorded pursuant to this subsection the date and hour of receipt and all facts that are necessary to indicate that the lien has been recorded. The lien may be amended to reflect payments to the insured made after the lien is recorded. Within thirty days after the lien is satisfied, the lienholder shall issue and record a release of the lien.

K. Any common law prohibition against assignments of causes of action for personal injuries is abrogated to the extent provided in subsection I of this section.

L. An insurer is not required to offer, provide or make available coverage conforming to this section in connection with any general commercial liability policy, excess policy, umbrella policy or other policy that does not provide primary motor vehicle insurance for liabilities arising out of the ownership, maintenance, operation or use of a specifically insured motor vehicle.

M. If an insured makes a bodily injury or death claim under uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage based on an accident that involved an unidentified motor vehicle and no physical contact with the motor vehicle occurred, the insured shall provide corroboration that the unidentified motor vehicle caused the accident. For the purposes of this subsection, "corroboration" means any additional and confirming testimony, fact or evidence that strengthens and adds weight or credibility to the insured's representation of the accident.

#### Section 20-259.02. Coverage to include car pool operators and car pool vehicles; definitions

A. A policy of private passenger vehicle insurance shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless coverage is provided for the protection of any person insured under such policy while such person is acting as a car pool operator, and for the protection of any vehicle insured under such policy while such vehicle is, or while it is being operated as, a car pool vehicle. Such car pool coverage shall not entail a premium higher than the premium would otherwise have been for such private passenger vehicle.

B. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Car pool operator" has the same meaning prescribed in section 28-4032.

2. "Car pool vehicle" means any motor vehicle when operated by a car pool operator.

3. "Private passenger vehicle" includes a vehicle accommodating no more than fifteen passengers and owned by a commercial organization but used exclusively as a car pool vehicle.

#### Section 20-259.03. Uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages; insured; wrongful death recovery

Notwithstanding any other law, in the case of the death of an insured who is covered under the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages of a motor vehicle liability policy, recovery for wrongful death is limited to any party who is qualified to bring a wrongful death action pursuant to section 12-612 and who is also a surviving insured under the same coverages of the policy. If there are no surviving insureds who qualify to bring a wrongful death action pursuant to section 12-612, the estate of the deceased insured maintains the right of recovery against the uninsured and underinsured motorist coverages of the motor vehicle policy.

#### Section 20-260. Limit of risk

A. No insurer shall retain any risk on any one subject of insurance, whether located or to be performed in this state or elsewhere, in an amount exceeding ten per cent of its surplus to policyholders, except that a domestic mutual insurer holding a certificate of authority may retain up to such ten per cent or up to the maximum applicable as set forth in section 20-711, whichever is the larger, and a domestic limited stock insurer may retain up to the maximum applicable as set forth in section 20-708.

B. Reinsurance authorized by section 20-261 shall be deducted in determining risk retained. As to surety risks, deduction shall also be made of the amount assumed by any established incorporated cosurety and the value of any security deposited, pledged or held subject to the surety's consent and for the surety's protection.

C. As to alien insurers, other than life insurers domiciled in Canada, this section shall relate only to risks and surplus to policyholders of the insurer's United States branch.

Every filing shall have a proposed effective date and shall indicate the character and extent of the coverage contemplated.Â  If a filing does not include the information on which the insurer supports the filing, and the director does not have sufficient information to determine whether the filing meets the rate regulatory requirements of this article, the director shall require the insurer to furnish information supporting the filing.Â  The supporting information may include the experience or judgment of the insurer or rating organization making the filing, its interpretation of any statistical data on which it relies, the experience of other insurers or rating organizations or any other relevant factors.Â  A filing and any supporting information shall be open to public inspection after the filing becomes effective.

B. A workers' compensation insurer shall satisfy its obligation to make filings by becoming a member of a licensed rating organization that makes filings and by authorizing the director to accept on its behalf filings made by the rating organization.Â  A rating organization shall annually file with the director rates to be effective on January 1. Nothing in this subsection requires an insurer to be a member of the designated rating organization.

C. Each filing shall be on file for a waiting period of at least thirty days before it becomes effective.Â  On written application by the insurer or rating organization making the filing, the director may authorize a filing to become effective before the waiting period expires.

D. On written application of the insured that states the insured's reasons and that is filed with and approved by the director, an insurer may use a rate in excess of the insurer's filed rate on the insured's risk.

E. An insurer shall not make or issue a contract or policy except in accordance with the filings in effect for that insurer as provided in the rate regulatory provisions of this article.

 

#### Section 20-358. Disapproval of rates

A. If at any time the director finds that a filing does not meet the standards set forth in section 20-356, he shall, after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice, in which he shall specify the matters to be considered at such hearing, to every insurer and rating organization which made the filing, issue an order specifying in what respects he finds that the filing fails to meet the requirements of the rate regulatory provisions of this article, and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, the filing or rating system shall be deemed no longer effective. Copies of the order shall be sent to every such insurer and rating organization. The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth therein.

B. Any person or organization aggrieved with respect to any filing or rating system which is in effect may make written application to the director for a hearing thereon, but the insurer or rating organization which made the filing or uses the rating system shall not be authorized to proceed under this subsection. The application shall specify the grounds to be relied upon by the applicant. If the director finds that the application is made in good faith, that the applicant would be so aggrieved if his grounds are established and that the grounds otherwise justify holding such a hearing, he shall within thirty days after receipt of the application hold a hearing upon not less than ten days' written notice to the applicant and to every insurer and rating organization which made such filing or uses such rating system. If, after the hearing, the director finds that the filing or rating system does not meet the requirements of the rate regulatory provisions of this article, he shall issue an order specifying in what respects he finds that it fails to meet such requirements and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, it shall be deemed no longer effective. Copies of the order shall be sent to the applicant and to every such insurer and rating organization. The order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth therein.

C. No manual of classifications, rules, rating plan or any modification of any of the foregoing which establishes standards for measuring variations in hazards or expense provisions, or both, and which is being used pursuant to the requirements of section 20-356, shall be disapproved if the rates thereby produced meet the requirements of the rate regulatory provisions of this article.

D. The director may utilize independent contractor examiners experienced in the review of applicable rates and reserves pursuant to sections 20-148 and 20-159 to implement the provisions of this article. All examination and examination related expenses shall be borne by the insurer and shall be paid by the insurance examiners' revolving fund pursuant to section 20-159.

#### Section 20-359. Deviations from filed workers' compensation rates

A. Every insurer shall adhere to the filings made by the rating organization of which it is a member, except that any member insurer may file with the director:

1. Up to six uniform percentage deviations that decrease or increase the statewide rate portion of the rating organization's rate filing. If more than one deviation is filed by an insurer, each deviation must be established consistent with the underwriting rules that are based on criteria that would lead to a logical distinction of potential risk.

2. A subclassification rate related rule that deviates from the rules or schedule rating plan filed by the insurer's rating organization.Â  An insurer shall not simultaneously apply a deviation and a schedule rating to the same insured risk.

B. In addition to the six uniform percentage deviations authorized under subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, insurers covering firefighters and fire investigators may file one uniform percentage deviation that increases the statewide rates under the rating organization's rate filing for the class codes associated with firefighters and fire investigators to address the anticipated increase in losses and expenses for claims that are compensable pursuant to section 23-901.09.Â  The deviation filing shall be accompanied by analysis from an actuary that substantively illustrates the basis for the rate increase, including information made available by the industrial commission of Arizona pursuant to section 23-971 and the anticipated and, when available, actual combined loss ratio, claim frequency and claim severity associated with these claims.Â  The supporting documentation submitted with the filing must be sufficient to allow the department to assess the reasonableness of the insurer's assumptions and justification for the deviation and shall include data related to workers' compensation indemnity and medical claims and administrative expenses associated specifically with presumptive coverage related to workers' compensation claims. The insurer may use data or analysis from any of the following sources:

1. The insured or insurer.

2. Self-funded employers providing workers' compensation.

3. The industrial commission of Arizona.

4. A risk retention pool.

5. Studies and information illustrating the state and national frequency of cancer among firefighters and fire investigators.

6. The assigned risk pool or assigned risk.

7. Claims and expense data from other relevant lines of insurance such as long-term disability insurance, group or individual major medical insurance or long-term care insurance.

8. Other available cancer-related statistics.

9. Relevant incurred but not reported workers' compensation claims data.

C. The director may use independent contractor examiners to analyze the supporting justification of a requested deviation under subsection B of this section pursuant to section 20-358, subsection D.

D. Notwithstanding subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section, in addition to the deviation filing authorized under subsection B of this section, insurers may file and apply a schedule rating plan to adjust premiums associated with firefighters and fire investigators class codes, based on loss control programs or activities undertaken by the insurer to reduce losses associated with section 23-901.09.Â  The schedule rating plan must be filed with and approved by the director and shall be in addition to and separate from any other schedule rating plan available to the insurer.

E. Each deviation filed shall be on file with the director for a waiting period of at least thirty days before it becomes effective, except that a deviation filed pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be on file with the director for at least sixty days before it becomes effective. On written application by the insurer making the filing, the director may authorize a filing to become effective before the waiting period expires. A deviation that is filed pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section and that is not disapproved by the director expires the following December 31 at midnight in this state unless the director terminates the deviation sooner. A deviation that is filed pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section continues until the insurer withdraws the deviation or the director determines that the deviation no longer meets the standards prescribed in section 20-356, paragraph 1. At any time the director may require an insurer to actuarially support a deviation. The insurer that files the deviation shall simultaneously send a copy of the filing to the rating organization of which it is a member and to any designated rating organization.

F. A rating organization shall notify the director if the organization disapproves any deviation relating to workers' compensation insurance. The director shall notify the industrial commission of Arizona of the disapproval within ten days after receipt of the disapproval from the rating organization.

#### Section 20-361. Licensing of rating organizations

A. A corporation, an unincorporated association, a partnership or an individual, whether located within or outside this state, may apply to the director for a license as a rating organization for insurance subject to this article and shall file all of the following with the director:

2. A list of its members.

3. The name and address of a resident of this state for service of process, notices and orders.

4. A statement of its qualifications as a rating organization.

5. A financial statement that is certified by an officer of the applicant, that is on a form acceptable to the director and that includes financial information that is current as of not more than ninety days before the date the application is filed with the director.Â  The financial statement shall include an income statement and a balance sheet that is prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles and that is for the two years immediately preceding the date of the financial statement.Â  The applicant shall not submit consolidated income statements or balance sheets.

6. A plan for the orderly and timely transfer to the designated statistical agent or the director of all data collected in accordance with the statistical plan in effect in this state from its member insurers in this state if the rating organization ceases to do business in this state.

B. If the director finds that the applicant is competent and otherwise qualified to act as a rating organization and that its constitution, articles of agreement or association or certificate of incorporation and its bylaws, rules and regulations governing the conduct of its business conform to the requirements of law, the director shall issue a license specifying the kinds of insurance, or subdivisions or classes of risks or parts or combinations thereof, for which the applicant is authorized to act as a rating organization. The director shall either grant or deny an application in whole or in part within sixty days after its filing.

C. Any member or insurer may request that the director review the reasonableness of any rule or regulation in its application to members at a hearing held on at least ten days' written notice to the rating organization and to the member or insurer. If the director finds that the rule or regulation is unreasonable in its application, the director shall order that the rule or regulation does not apply.

D. Every insurer writing workers' compensation insurance in this state shall be a member of one workers' compensation rating organization.

E. A rating organization shall have as members at least five insurers authorized to write and who are writing workers' compensation insurance in this state and whose combined experience is determined by the director to be reasonably adequate for rate making purposes.

Any rating organization may provide for the examination of policies, daily reports, binders, renewal certificates, endorsements or other evidence of insurance, or the cancellation thereof, and may make reasonable rules governing their submission. Such rules shall contain a provision that in the event any insurer does not within sixty days furnish satisfactory evidence to the rating organization of the correction of any error or omission previously called to its attention by the rating organization, it shall be the duty of the rating organization to notify the director thereof. All information so submitted shall be confidential.

B. Any rating organization may subscribe for or purchase actuarial, technical or other services, and such services shall be available to all members and subscribers without discrimination.

#### Section 20-365. Cooperation in rate making

Cooperation among rating organizations and among rating organizations and insurers in rate making and in other matters within the scope of this article is authorized, if the filings resulting from such cooperation are subject to the provisions of this article. The director may review such cooperative activities and practices and if, after a hearing, he finds that any such activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this article, he may issue a written order specifying in what respects such activity or practice is unfair or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent, and requiring the discontinuance of such activity or practice.

#### Section 20-366. Appeal by member or subscriber from action relating to filings

A. Any member of or subscriber to a rating organization may appeal to the director from the action or decision of the rating organization in approving or rejecting any proposed change in or addition to the filings of the rating organization, and the director shall, after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice to the applicant and to the rating organization, issue an order approving the action or decision of the rating organization or directing it to give further consideration to the proposal, or if the appeal is from the action or decision of the rating organization in rejecting a proposed addition to its filings, the director may, in the event that he shall find that such action or decision was unreasonable, issue an order directing the rating organization to make an addition to its filings, on behalf of its members and subscribers, in a manner consistent with the findings of the director, within a reasonable time after the issuance of the order.

B. In the case of insurance to which this article applies, if the appeal is based upon the failure of the rating organization to make a filing on behalf of such member or subscriber which is based on a system of expense provisions which differs from the system of expense provisions included in a filing made by the rating organization, the director shall, if he grants the appeal, order the rating organization to make the requested filing for use by the applicant. In deciding the appeal the director shall apply the standards set forth in section 20-356.

The failure of a title insurance rating organization to take action or make a decision within thirty days after submission to it of a proposal under this article shall constitute a rejection of such proposal within the meaning of this section.Â  If such appeal is based upon the failure of the rating organization to make a filing on behalf of such members or subscriber which is based on a system of expense allocation which differs from the system of expense allocation included in a filing made by the rating organization, the director shall, if he grants the appeal, order the rating organization to make the requested filing for use by the applicant. In deciding such appeal, the director shall apply the standards set forth in section 20-375.

A. The director shall adopt reasonable rules and statistical plans that are reasonably adapted to each of the rating systems on file with the director and that may be modified from time to time.Â  An insurer shall use the rules and statistical plans to record and report its loss and countrywide expense experience in order that the experience of all insurers may be made available, at least annually, in sufficient form and detail to aid the director in determining whether rating systems comply with the standards set forth in this article. The rules and plans may also provide for the recording and reporting of expense experience items that are especially applicable to this state and that are not susceptible to determination by prorating of countrywide expense experience.

B. In adopting the rules and plans, the director shall give due consideration to the rating systems on file with the director, and, in order that the rules and plans may be as uniform as is practicable among the several states, to the rules and to the form of plans used for comparable rating systems in other states.

D. The director may designate an organization the director deems qualified, other than an insurer that has outstanding obligations under a policy of workers' compensation insurance in this state, to act as the director's statistical agent. The statistical agent shall assist the director in gathering and compiling workers' compensation experience and performing other related services as the director may specify. The compilations shall be made available subject to reasonable rules adopted by the director, to insurers and rating organizations, but no insurer shall be required to file its experience with an organization of which it is not a member.

E. Every insurer shall report its loss and expense experience to the rating organization of which it is a member.Â  The rating organization shall report the insurer's experience to the designated statistical agent.Â  If the rating organization is unable to report the experience of its member insurers to the designated statistical agent, every insurer that is a member of the rating organization shall directly report its experience to the designated statistical agent.

F. If there is more than one licensed rating organization that meets the requirements of section 20-363, subsection E, the director shall designate one of the organizations as the designated rating organization for the purpose of annually making and filing with the director statewide workers' compensation insurance rates that become effective on January 1.

G. The designated rating organization shall annually file its rate filing with the director on or before August 1 for rates that become effective on January 1.Â  The director shall disapprove the filing if it does not meet the standards of section 20-356, paragraph 1. An insurer transacting workers' compensation insurance in this state shall adhere to the expected loss ratios, ballast factors and other experience rating factors and to the statewide rates and other rating values made by the designated rating organization for the uniform rate filing, except that an insurer may deviate from the statewide rate portion of the uniform rate filing according to section 20-359, subsections A and B.

H. The director may allow the designated statistical agent and designated rating organization to charge licensed rating organizations that operate in this state a reasonable fee for their services. The licensed rating organizations shall pay the fees on a ratable basis.

I. To further the uniform administration of rate regulatory laws, the director and every insurer and rating organization may exchange information and experience data with insurance supervisory officials, insurers and rating organizations in other states and may consult with them with respect to rate making and the application of rating systems.

J. If more than one rating organization meets the requirements of section 20-363, subsection E, the director shall designate the statistical plan, classification plan or experience rating plan adopted by the designated rating organization or any other rating organization, or the plans of another state, as the uniform statistical plan, the uniform classification plan or the uniform experience rating plan.

K. If the director does not designate a uniform statistical plan, a uniform classification plan or a uniform experience rating plan pursuant to this section, each insurer shall adhere to the statistical plan, classification plan, and experience rating plan adopted by the rating organization of which the insurer is a member in this state.

#### Section 20-372. Disclosure of information relating to rates

No person or organization shall wilfully withhold information from, or knowingly give false or misleading information to, the director, any statistical agency designated by the director, any rating organization or any insurer, which will affect the rates or premiums chargeable under this article.

#### Section 20-373. Commissions and fees

Nothing in this article shall abridge or restrict the freedom of contract of insurers, agents or brokers with reference to the amount of commissions or fees to be paid to agents or brokers by insurers, and such payments are expressly authorized.

#### Section 20-374. Revocation and suspension of licenses

The director may suspend the license of any rating organization or the certificate of authority of any insurer which fails to comply with an order of the director made pursuant to this article within the time limited by the order, or any extension thereof which may be granted by the director. The director shall not suspend the license of any rating organization or the certificate of authority of any insurer for failure to comply with an order until the time prescribed for a review thereof has expired, or if a review has been sought, until the order has been affirmed. The director may determine when a suspension of license or certificate shall become effective, and it shall remain in effect for the period fixed by him, unless he modifies or rescinds the suspension, or until the order upon which suspension is based is modified, rescinded or reversed. No license or certificate shall be suspended or revoked except upon the written order of the director stating his findings, made after a hearing held upon not less than ten days written notice to such person or organization, specifying the alleged violation.

#### Section 20-375. Making of title insurance rates

A. Every title insurer that shall make its own rates, and every title insurance rating organization, shall make rates that are not excessive nor inadequate for the safety and soundness of any title insurer, that do not unfairly discriminate between risks in this state which involve essentially the same exposure to loss and expense elements, and that give due consideration to all of the following matters:

1. The desirability for stability of rate structures.

2. The necessity, by encouraging growth in assets of title insurers in periods of high business activity, of assuring the financial solvency of title insurers in periods of economic depression.

3. The necessity for paying dividends on the capital stock of title insurers sufficient to induce capital to be invested therein.

B. Every title insurer that shall make its own rates, and every title insurance rating organization, shall adopt basic classifications of policies or contracts of title insurance which shall be used as the basis for rates.

C. Rates within each rate classification may, at the discretion of the title insurer which files its own rates, or at the discretion of the title insurance rating organization, be less than the cost of the expense elements in the case of smaller insurance policies or contracts, and the excess may be charged against the larger insurance policies or contracts without rendering the rates unfairly discriminatory.

D. There shall be no combined rate for the issuance of title insurance policies and escrow services rendered in connection with such insurance.

#### Section 20-376. Filing of title insurance rates; approval or disapproval

A. Every title insurer shall file with the director its schedules of fees, every manual of classifications, rules and plans pertaining thereto, and every modification of any of the foregoing that it proposes to use concerning its title insurance forms and products in this state.Â  Every filing shall include a proposed effective date and shall indicate the character and extent of the coverage or service contemplated.

B. A title insurer may satisfy its obligations to make filings by becoming a member of, or a subscriber to, a licensed title insurance rating organization that makes filings, and by authorizing the director to accept the rating organization's filings on its behalf. The filings may, at the option of the insurer, govern all of its or certain designated agents in this state.Â  The insurer may also elect to permit all or certain of its agents to make rate filings directly or to subscribe to a licensed title insurance rating organization that makes filings.

C. The director shall review the filings as necessary to carry out the provisions of this article.

D. Subject to the provisions of subsection F of this section, each filing shall be on file for a period of at least thirty days before it becomes effective.Â  The director may, on written notice given within the thirty day waiting period to the person making the filing, extend the waiting period for up to fifteen additional days, to enable the director to complete the review of the filing.Â  The director may grant further extensions of the waiting period only with the consent of the person making the filing. On written application by the person making the filing, the director may authorize all or part of a filing that has been reviewed to become effective before the expiration of the waiting period or any extension of the waiting period.

E. Except in the case of rates filed under subsection F, a filing that has become effective shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this article.

F. When the director finds that any rate for a particular kind or class of risk cannot practicably be filed before it is used, or that any contract or kind of title insurance, by reason of rarity or peculiar circumstances, does not lend itself to advance determination and filing of rates, the director may permit the rate to be used without a previous filing and waiting period.

G. The director shall not have the power to regulate, or require the filing of, rates or fees for reinsurance policies, contracts or agreements, for policies, contracts or agreements of excess coinsurance or for account servicing and subdivision trust services.

 

 

#### Section 20-377. Justification for title insurance rates

A. A title insurance filing shall be accompanied by a statement of the title insurer, title insurance agent, or title insurance rating organization making the filing, setting forth the basis upon which the rate was fixed, and the manner in which fees are to be computed. Any filing may be justified by:

1. The experience or judgment of the title insurer, title insurance agent, or title insurance rating organization making the filing.

2. Its interpretation of any statistical data relied upon.

3. The experience of other title insurers, title insurance agents, or title insurance rating organizations.

4. Any other factors which the title insurer, title insurance agent, or title insurance rating organization deems relevant.

B. The statement and justification shall be open to public inspection after the rate to which they apply becomes effective.

#### Section 20-378. Disapproval of title insurance filings

A. Before issuing an order of disapproval of a title insurance filing, the director shall hold a hearing upon not less than ten days' written notice, specifying in reasonable detail the matters to be considered at such hearing. Such notice shall be sent to every title insurer, title insurance agent and title insurance rating organization which made such filing. If, after such hearing, the director finds that such filing or a part thereof does not meet the requirements of this article, he shall issue an order specifying in what respects he finds that it so fails, and stating when, within a reasonable period thereafter, such filing or a part thereof shall be deemed no longer effective if the filing or a part thereof has become effective under the provisions of section 20-376. A title insurer, title insurance agent or title insurance rating organization shall have the right at any time to withdraw a filing or a part thereof. Copies of every such order shall be sent to every title insurer, title insurance agent and title insurance rating organization affected. Such an order shall not affect any contract or preliminary report, commitment, binder or title insurance policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth therein.

B. Any person or organization aggrieved with respect to any filing which is in effect may make written application to the director for a hearing thereon, but the title insurer, title insurance agent or title insurance rating organization which made the filing shall not be authorized to proceed under this subsection. Such an application shall specify in reasonable detail the grounds to be relied upon by the applicant. If the director finds that the application is made in good faith, that the applicant would be so aggrieved if his grounds are established, and that such grounds otherwise justify holding such a hearing, he shall, within thirty days after receipt of such application, hold a hearing upon not less than ten days' written notice to the applicant and to every title insurer, title insurance agent and title insurance rating organization which made such a filing. If, after such hearing, the director finds that the filing or a part thereof does not meet the requirements of this article, he shall issue an order specifying in what respects he finds that such filing or a part thereof fails to meet the requirements of this article and stating when within a reasonable period thereafter such filing or a part thereof shall be deemed no longer effective. Copies of such an order shall be sent to the applicant and to every such title insurer, title insurance agent and title insurance rating organization that made the filing. Such an order shall not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the expiration of the period set forth therein.

C. No filing nor any modification thereof shall be disapproved if the rates in connection therewith meet the requirements of this article.

#### Section 20-379. Deviations in title insurance rates

A. No title insurer or title insurance agent may deviate from its rates that are in effect for the title insurer or title insurance agent pursuant to section 20-376.

B. If the director finds that a title insurer or title insurance agent has charged rates that deviate from its rates filed pursuant to section 20-376, the title insurer or title insurance agent who computed and initially collected the deviation is subject to a civil penalty for each deviation that is equal to the difference between the rate charged and the allowable rate pursuant to section 20-376. To the extent that the deviation results in an overcharge, the director in lieu of a civil penalty may require a refund of the overcharge.

C. If after a hearing the director finds that a title insurer or title insurance agent with such frequency as to indicate a general business practice violated the provisions of this section and section 20-376 with respect to a particular provision of the applicable title insurance rate, the director, in addition to the civil penalty imposed under subsection B of this section, may:

1. For each violation, impose an additional civil penalty of not more than two times the civil penalty imposed under subsection B of this section.

2. Order the title insurance agent to cease and desist from the act or practice.

3. Revoke the title insurance agent's license or suspend the title insurer's certificate of authority.

D. The civil penalties that are imposed under subsections B and C of this section may not in the aggregate exceed fifteen thousand dollars during any one year period for an individual title insurer or title insurance agent licensed pursuant to this title.

#### Section 20-382. Scope of application

A. This article applies to all insurance on risks or on operations in this state, except:

1. Reinsurance, other than joint reinsurance to the extent stated in section 20-391.

2. Any policy of insurance against loss or damage to or legal liability in connection with property located outside this state, any motor vehicle or aircraft principally garaged and used outside this state or any activity wholly carried on outside this state.

3. Insurance of vessels or craft, their cargoes, marine builders' risks, marine protection and indemnity or other risks commonly insured under marine, as distinguished from inland marine, insurance policies.

4. Disability or life insurance.

5. Annuities.

6. Workers' compensation and employers' liability insurance written in connection with workers' compensation.

7. Title insurance.

8. Rates developed by an insurer to be applied individually to the insurance policies of risks, other than medical malpractice risks and industrial insured risks pursuant to section 20-400.10, for which no rate service organization has published a rate or loss costs in this or any other state and for which insufficient similar exposure units and loss experience data exist to develop statistically credible rates for the risk and no homogeneous rating class exists in which the risk could reasonably be placed. With respect to each type of risk covered by this subsection, the insurer shall annually certify by January 30 to the director for the preceding calendar year, on a form acceptable to the director, that the insurer did not have when the risks were written credible experience to establish a rating class for the specific types of risks.Â  The insurer or rate service organization on the insurer's behalf shall file a rate for the specific risks with the director pursuant to section 20-385 when either of the following occurs:

(a) The insurer's written premiums for any specific risk covered by this subsection exceed twenty-five per cent of the insurer's total annual written premium in this state and the insurer has issued contracts for five or more homogeneous risks covered by this subsection in this state in any consecutive three year period, unless an insurer demonstrates to the director that its experience under this subsection does not produce sufficient data to satisfy the requirements of subdivision (b) of this paragraph.

(b) The number of specific risks covered by this subsection and written by the insurer in a specific class meet the standards set forth in the actuarial standard of practice 25 applying to credibility for rate making purposes as adopted by the actuarial standards board as of January 1, 1997.

B. This article does not apply to hospital service or medical service corporations, investment companies, mutual benefit associations or fraternal beneficiary associations.

#### Section 20-383. Rate standards

A. An insurer shall not charge rates that are excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. An insurer shall not charge any rate which if continued will have or tend to have the effect of destroying competition or establishing a monopoly.

B. Rates are excessive if they are likely to produce an underwriting profit that is unreasonably high for the class of business or if expenses are unreasonably high in relation to established services rendered. Rates are presumed not to be excessive if a reasonable degree of price competition exists at the consumer level with respect to a particular class of business. A competitive market is presumed to exist unless the director, after a hearing, determines that a reasonable degree of price competition does not exist in the market and issues an order pursuant to section 20-388 to that effect. The order expires no later than one year after its effective date unless the director finds, after a hearing, that there is a continuing lack of reasonable competition in the market. If the director finds, after a hearing, that a reasonable degree of price competition among insurers writing a particular line, subline or class of business does not exist, he may prescribe an allowable percentage of increase in a proposed rate level for such line, subline or class of business. Any insurer making a rate filing exceeding the allowable percentage of increase shall, prior to the effective date of such proposed rate increase, provide the director with sufficient actuarial data to support such increase. The director's order establishing allowable percentages of increase for a particular line, subline or class of business shall expire no later than one year after its effective date. In determining whether a reasonable degree of price competition exists, the director shall consider relevant tests of competition pertaining to market structure, market performance and market conduct, including:

1. The number of insurers actively engaged in the class of business.

2. The market share and changes in market share of insurers.

3. The existence of a degree of rate differentials in a particular class of business.

4. The ease of entry and latent competition of insurers capable of easy entry.

C. Rates are inadequate if they are clearly insufficient to sustain projected losses and expenses in the class of business to which they apply.

D. A rate is not unfairly discriminatory in relation to another in the same class if it reflects equitably the differences in expected losses and expenses. Rates are not unfairly discriminatory because different premiums result for policyholders with like loss exposures but different expense factors, or like expense factors but different loss exposures, if the rates reflect the differences with reasonable accuracy. Rates are not unfairly discriminatory if they are averaged broadly among persons insured under a group, franchise or blanket policy.

#### Section 20-384. Rating criteria

A. In setting rates, an insurer shall apply the criteria prescribed in this section.

B. An insurer shall give due consideration to past and prospective loss and expense experience within and outside this state, to catastrophe hazards, to a reasonable margin for underwriting profit and contingencies, to investment income from unearned premium and loss reserves, to trends within and outside this state, to reasonable dividends or savings to be allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers and to all other factors, including judgment factors.

C. Risks may be classified in any reasonable way for the establishment of rates and minimum premiums. Classifications shall not be based on race, color, creed or national origin. Rates produced may be modified for individual risks in accordance with rating plans or schedules that establish reasonable standards for measuring probable variations in hazards or expenses, or both.

D. The expense provisions included in the rates to be used by an insurer may reflect the operating methods of the insurer and its own expense experience.

E. Rates and supplementary rate information established pursuant to this article shall not be based on or include loss and expense experience attributable to insurance coverage issued to an industrial insured pursuant to section 20-400.10.

 

#### Section 20-385. Filing of rates

A. Except as to marine, inland marine and transportation risks, which by general custom of the business are not written according to manual rates and rating plans, and except as provided in subsection F of this section or section 20-400.10, every authorized insurer and every rate service organization which has been designated by any insurer for the filing of rates pursuant to section 20-387, subsection B shall file with the director all rates and supplementary rate information and all changes and amendments to those rates made by it for use in this state within thirty days after they become effective. If a rate service organization files prospective loss costs on behalf of its member insurers with the director, each member insurer that adopts the rate service organization's prospective loss costs shall file, on a form approved by the director, the loss cost adjustment and loss cost modification factors applicable to the prospective loss costs filed by the rate service organization.Â  Each member insurer that does not adopt or that delays adoption of the loss costs filed by the rate service organization shall notify the director of that decision, in a form acceptable to the director, within thirty days after the effective date of the prospective loss costs.

B. For any filing made pursuant to subsection A of this section, the director may require the filing of supporting data including:

1. The experience and judgment of the filer.

2. The experience and judgment of other insurers or rate service organizations.

3. The filer's interpretation of any statistical data relied upon.

4. A description of the methods used in making the rates.

5. A description of the methods used and statistics relied on by the insurer in developing its loss cost modification factor and providing its loss cost adjustment.

6. A description of the methods used and statistics relied on by the rate service organization in developing its prospective loss costs filing.

C. An insurer is not required to file with the director the insurerâs final rate pages that combine the prospective loss costs separately filed by the rate service organization with the loss cost modification factor filed by the insurer.

D. For the purposes of this section, an insurer does not need to file with the director the insurer's final rate pages that combine the prospective loss costs with the loss cost adjustments.

E. On written consent of the insured stating the insured's reasons, the insurer may use a rate in excess of that provided by an otherwise applicable filing on a specific risk, if that rate is filed with the director pursuant to subsection A of this section.

F. For as long as the director deems proper, the director by order may exempt from the requirements of this section any insurance rate, rating class, rating rule or rating program or type the filing of which in the director's opinion is not desirable or necessary for the protection of the public.

G. If, after a hearing, the director finds that a particular market is noncompetitive, the director shall order that all rates or rate changes and all supplementary rate information in the noncompetitive market be filed with the director at least thirty days before the effective date. The order remains in effect until the director determines that a competitive market has been restored.

#### Section 20-386. Filings open to inspection

The director shall open to public inspection at any reasonable time each filing and supporting information filed pursuant to this article except information in a filing or supporting information that is a trade secret under title 44, chapter 4, article 1. Â The insurer or filer shall have the burden of asserting to the director that the information is a trade secret. A person may obtain copies of materials open to public inspection upon request and payment of a reasonable charge.

 

#### Section 20-387. Delegation of rate making and rate filing obligations

A. An insurer may establish rates and supplementary rate information based on the factors in section 20-384 using, if desired, the recommendations of an advisory organization, or rates and supplementary rate information prepared by a rate service organization, with average expense factors determined by the rate service organization or with such modification for its own expense and loss experience as the credibility of that experience allows.

B. An insurer may discharge its obligations pursuant to section 20-385 by giving notice to the director that it uses rates and supplementary rate information prepared by a designated rate service organization, with such information about modifications of the rates as is necessary to inform the director. The insurer's rates and supplementary rate information are those filed by the rate service organization, including any amendments to the rate as filed, subject to the modifications filed by the insurer.

C. Licensed rate service organizations, advisory organizations and admitted insurers are authorized to exchange information and experience data with rate service organizations, advisory organizations and insurers in this and other states and may consult with them with respect to rate making.

#### Section 20-388. Disapproval of rates

If the director finds that a rate is not in compliance with section 20-383, the director shall issue an order specifying in what respects it so fails and stating that, within thirty days after the order is issued, the rate is no longer effective.Â  The order does not affect any contract or policy made or issued prior to the effective date of the order. The order shall be served immediately pursuant to section 20-151.Â  Any insurer, rate service organization or advisory organization may request a hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10, and the request for a hearing stays the effectiveness of the order as provided in section 20-162.

 

#### Section 20-389. Rate service organizations; license; application

A. A rate service organization shall not provide any service relating to the rates of any insurance subject to this article nor may any insurer utilize the service of such organization for such purposes unless the organization has obtained a license from the director.

B. No rate service organization may refuse to supply any services for which it is licensed in this state to any insurer authorized to do business in this state and offering to pay the fair and usual compensation for the services.

C. A rate service organization applying for a license shall include with its application:

1. A copy of its constitution, charter, articles of organization, agreement, association or incorporation and a copy of its bylaws and any other rules or regulations governing its activities.

2. A list of its members and subscribers.

3. The name and address of one or more residents of this state upon whom notices, process affecting it or orders of the director may be served.

4. A statement showing its technical qualifications for acting in the capacity for which it seeks a license.

5. Any other relevant information or documents the director may require.

D. If the director finds that the applicant and the natural persons through whom it acts are qualified to provide the services proposed and that all requirements of law are met, the director shall issue a license specifying the authorized activity of the applicant. The director shall not issue a license if the proposed activity would tend to establish a monopoly or to lessen or to destroy price competition. Licenses issued pursuant to this section remain in effect until the licensee withdraws from this state or until the license is suspended or revoked.

E. A rate service organization shall promptly file any amendment to a document required to be filed pursuant to this section. Failure to file any such amendment is a ground for suspension of the license during the period of noncompliance. Repeated failures to file such amendments are grounds for revocation of the license.

F. Pending its application to the director for a license to provide services as a rate service organization, every rating organization providing services in this state on the effective date of this section may continue to provide services after that date as a rate service organization subject to the provisions of this article. A rate service organization shall apply for a license within thirty days after the effective date of this article.

#### Section 20-390. Advisory organizations; filing with director

#### Section 20-392. Rate agreements among insurers prohibited

A. Except with respect to apportionment agreements among insurers approved by the director pursuant to section 20-395, an insurer shall not assume any obligation to any person, other than a policyholder or other insurers which, with it, are under common control or management or are members of a joint underwriting or joint reinsurance organization, to use or adhere to certain rates or rules. No person other than the director may impose any penalty or other adverse consequence for failure of an insurer to adhere to certain rates or rules.

B. Members and subscribers of rate service organizations or advisory organizations may use the work products and services of such organizations as their individual judgment may dictate.

#### Section 20-393. Recording and reporting of experience

The director shall promulgate reasonable rules, including rules providing statistical plans, for use by all insurers in the recording and reporting of loss and expense experience, in order that the experience of such insurers may be made available to the director.

Â The organization examined shall pay the reasonable costs of the examination upon presentation to it of a detailed account of the costs.Â  The organization examined shall exhibit all books, records, accounts, documents or agreements governing its method of operation. In lieu of the examination the director may accept the report of an examination made by the insurance supervisory official of another state, pursuant to the laws of such state.

The director may determine when a suspension of a license becomes effective and it shall remain in effect for the period fixed by the director, unless the director modifies or rescinds such suspension, or until the order upon which such suspension is based is modified, rescinded or reversed.

D. The director shall not impose a penalty or suspend or revoke a license except upon a written order stating the director's findings, made after a hearing held upon not less than ten days' written notice to such person or organization specifying the alleged violation.

C. Any property insurance policy containing wildfire protection services, including wildfire mitigation and wildfire suppression services conducted by a private entity, that is issued for delivery to an insured in this state shall contain a conspicuously stamped or written notice in bold-faced type that states that the wildfire protection services are not subject to review by the department.

#### Section 20-399. Payment of dividends

This article does not prohibit or regulate the payment of dividends, savings or unabsorbed premium deposits allowed or returned by insurers to their policyholders, members or subscribers.

Intentionally practicing or planning does not include a policy owner's lawful assignment of the policy owner's life insurance policy.

1. A policy loan by a life insurance company pursuant to the terms of the life insurance policy or accelerated death provisions contained in the life insurance policy, whether issued with the original policy or as a rider.

(b) The loan proceeds are used solely to pay premiums for the policy and to pay any costs or expenses incurred by the lender or the borrower in connection with the financing.

(c) The owner has not agreed on the date of the premium finance loan to sell, directly or indirectly, the policy or any portion of the policy's death benefit on any date following the issuance of the policy.

(d) The owner does not receive on the date of the premium finance loan a guarantee of the future value of the sale of the policy.

3. A collateral assignment of a life insurance policy by an owner.

4. A loan made by a lender that does not violate title 6, chapter 14, article 1, if the loan does not violate this section.

(a) Are closely related to the insured by blood or law.

(b) Have a lawful substantial economic interest in the continued life, health and bodily safety of the person insured, or are trusts established primarily for the benefit of such parties.

6. Any designation, consent or agreement by an insured who is an employee of an employer in connection with the purchase by the employer, or trust established by the employer, of life insurance on the life of the employee.

7. A bona fide business succession planning arrangement that is between one or more of the following:

(a) Shareholders in a corporation or between a corporation and one or more of its shareholders or one or more trusts established by its shareholders.

(b) Partners in a partnership or between a partnership and one or more of its partners or one or more trusts established by its partners.

#### Section 20-444. False or deceptive advertising of insurance or status as insurer

A. No person shall make, publish, disseminate, circulate or place before the public, or cause, directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated or placed before the public, in a newspaper, magazine or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter or poster, or over any radio or television station, or in any other way, any advertisement, announcement, sales material or statement containing any assertion, representation or statement with respect to the business of insurance or with respect to any person in the conduct of his insurance business, which is untrue, deceptive or misleading.

B. No person that is not an insurer shall assume or use any name which deceptively infers or suggests that it is an insurer.

#### Section 20-445. Defamation

No person shall make, publish, disseminate or circulate, directly or indirectly, or aid, abet or encourage the making, publishing, disseminating or circulating of any oral or written statement or any pamphlet, circular, article, sales material or literature which is false or maliciously critical of or derogatory to the financial condition of an insurer, and which is calculated to injure any person engaged in the business of insurance, or any domestic corporation or group being formed pursuant to this code for the purpose of becoming an insurer. This provision shall not be deemed to restrict the right, lawfully exercised, of newspapers, magazines, radio and television stations, and similar public media for news dissemination, objectively to publish and disseminate news.

#### Section 20-446. Acts tending to result in unreasonable restraint or monopoly of insurance business

No person shall enter into any agreement to commit, or by any concerted action commit, any act of boycott, coercion or intimidation resulting in or tending to result in unreasonable restraint of, or monopoly in, the business of insurance.

B. No person shall make any false entry in any book, report or statement of any insurer or other person required to have records under this title, with intent to deceive any agent or examiner lawfully appointed to examine into its condition or into any of its affairs, or any public official to whom the insurer or person is required by law to report, or who has authority by law to examine into its condition or into any of its affairs, or, with like intent, wilfully omit to make a true entry of any material fact pertaining to the business of the insurer or person in any book, report or statement thereof.

#### Section 20-448. Unfair discrimination; definitions

A. A person shall not make or permit any unfair discrimination between individuals of the same class and equal expectation of life in the rates charged for any contract of life insurance or of life annuity or in the dividends or other benefits payable or in any other of the terms and conditions of the contract.

B. A person shall not make or permit any unfair discrimination respecting hemophiliacs or between individuals of the same class and of essentially the same hazard in the amount of premium, policy fees or rates charged for any policy or contract of disability insurance or in the benefits payable or in any of the terms or conditions of the contract, or in any other manner whatever. The provisions of this subsection regarding hemophiliacs do not apply to any policy or subscription contract that provides only benefits for specific diseases or for accidental injuries or that provides only indemnity for blood transfusion services or replacement of whole blood products, fractions or derivatives.

C. As to kinds of insurance other than life and disability, a person shall not make or permit any unfair discrimination in favor of particular persons or between insureds or subjects of insurance having substantially like insuring, risk and exposure factors, or expense elements, in the terms or conditions of any insurance contract, or in the rate or amount of premium charged.

D. An insurer shall not refuse to consider an application for life or disability insurance on the basis of a genetic condition, developmental delay or developmental disability.

E. The rejection of an application or the determining of rates, terms or conditions of a life or disability insurance contract on the basis of a genetic condition, developmental delay or developmental disability constitutes unfair discrimination, unless the applicant's medical condition and history and either claims experience or actuarial projections establish that substantial differences in claims are likely to result from the genetic condition, developmental delay or developmental disability.

F. In addition to the provisions in subsection E of this section, the rejection of an application or the determination of rates, terms or conditions of a disability insurance contract on the basis of a genetic condition constitutes unfair discrimination in the absence of a diagnosis of the condition related to information obtained as a result of a genetic test.

G. An insurer that offers life, disability or long-term care insurance contracts may not unfairly discriminate against a living organ donor in the offering, issuance, price or conditions of an insurance policy based solely, and without additional actuarial risks, on that person's status as a living organ donor.

H. An insurer that offers life, disability, property or liability insurance contracts shall not deny a claim incurred or deny, refuse, refuse to renew, restrict, cancel, exclude or limit coverage or charge a different rate for the same coverage solely on the basis that the insured or proposed insured is or has been a victim of domestic violence or is an entity or individual that provides counseling, shelter, protection or other services to victims of domestic violence. If an insurer that offers life, disability, property or liability insurance contracts denies a claim incurred or denies, refuses, refuses to renew, restricts, cancels, excludes or limits coverage or charges a different rate for the same coverage on the basis of a mental or physical condition and the insured or the proposed insured is or has been a victim of domestic violence, the insurer shall submit a written explanation to the insured or proposed insured of the reasons for the insurer's actions, in accordance with section 20-2110. The fact that an insured or proposed insured is or has been the victim of domestic violence is not a mental or physical condition. This subsection is not intended to provide any private right or cause of action to or on behalf of any applicant or insured. It is the specific intent of this subsection to provide solely an administrative remedy to the director for any violation of this section. This subsection does not prevent an insurer from refusing to issue a life insurance policy insuring a person who has been the victim of domestic violence if either of the following is true:

1. The family or household member who commits the act of domestic violence is the applicant for or prospective owner of the policy or would be the beneficiary of the policy and any of the following is true:

(a) The applicant or prospective beneficiary of the policy is known, on the basis of police or court records, to have committed an act of domestic violence.

(b) The insurer has knowledge of an arrest or conviction for a domestic violence related offense by the family or household member.

(c) The insurance company has other reasonable grounds to believe, and those grounds are corroborated, that the applicant or proposed beneficiary of a policy is a family or household member committing acts of domestic violence.

2. The applicant or prospective owner of the policy lacks an insurable interest in the insured.

I. Subsection H of this section does not prevent an insurer that:

1. Offers life or disability insurance contracts from underwriting coverage on the basis of an insured's or proposed insured's mental or physical condition if the underwriting:

(a) Does not consider whether or not the mental or physical condition was caused by an act of domestic violence.

(b) Is the same for an insured or proposed insured who is not the victim of domestic violence as it is for an insured or proposed insured who is the victim of domestic violence.

(c) Does not violate any other rule or law.

2. Offers property or liability insurance contracts from underwriting coverage on the basis of the insured's claims history or characteristics of the insured's property and using rating criteria consistent with section 20-384.

J. Any determination made pursuant to section 20-2537 by the external independent review organization shall not be considered in connection with the evaluation of whether any person subject to this article has complied with this section.

K. A property or liability insurer may exclude coverage for losses caused by an insured's intentional or fraudulent act.Â  The exclusion shall not deny an insured's otherwise covered property loss if the property loss is caused by an act of domestic violence by another insured under the policy and the insured who claims the property loss cooperates in any investigation relating to the loss and did not cooperate in or contribute to the creation of the property loss.Â  The insurer may apply reasonable standards of proof for claims filed under this subsection.Â  The insurer may limit the payment to the insured's insurable interest in the property minus any payment made to any mortgagee or other party with a secured interest in the property. This subsection does not require an insurer to pay any amount that is more than the amount of the loss or property coverage limits. An insurer who pays a claim under this subsection has the right of subrogation against any person except the victim of the domestic violence.

L. All insurers shall adopt and adhere to written policies that are consistent with chapter 11 of this title and that specify the procedures to be followed by employees, contractors, producers, agents and brokers to ensure the privacy of and to help protect the safety of a victim of domestic violence when taking an application, investigating a claim, pursuing subrogation or taking any other action relating to a policy or claim involving a victim of domestic violence.Â  Insurers shall distribute the written policies to employees, contractors, producers, agents and brokers who have access to personal or privileged information regarding domestic violence.

A. Any domestic insurer, either by itself or in cooperation with one or more persons, may organize or acquire one or more subsidiaries subject to the limitations of this article. Such subsidiaries may conduct any kind of business or businesses and the authority to do so shall not be limited by reason of the fact that such subsidiaries are subsidiaries of a domestic insurer.

B. In addition to investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities permitted under all other sections of this title, a domestic insurer, pursuant to subsection A of this section, may:

1. Invest in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations and other securities of one or more subsidiaries in amounts that do not exceed the lesser of ten per cent of such insurer's assets or fifty per cent of such insurer's surplus as regards policyholders, provided that after such investments the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders will be reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs. In calculating the amount of such investments, investments in domestic or foreign insurance subsidiaries and health care service organizations shall be excluded, and there shall be included total net monies or other consideration expended and obligations assumed in the acquisition or formation of a subsidiary including all organizational expenses and contributions to capital and surplus of such subsidiary whether or not represented by the purchase of capital stock or issuance of other securities, and all amounts expended in acquiring additional common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations, and other securities and all contributions to the capital or surplus, of a subsidiary subsequent to its acquisition or formation.

C. Investments in common stock, preferred stock, debt obligations or other securities of subsidiaries made pursuant to subsection B of this section are not subject to any of the otherwise applicable restrictions or prohibitions contained in this title applicable to such investment of insurers.

D. Whether any investment pursuant to subsection B of this section meets the applicable requirements is to be determined before the investment is made by calculating the applicable investment limitations as if the investment had already been made, taking into account the then outstanding principal balance on all previous investments in debt obligations, and the value of all previous investments in equity securities as of the date they were made, net of any return of capital invested, not including dividends.

E. If an insurer ceases to control a subsidiary, it shall dispose of any investment in the subsidiary made pursuant to this section within three years from the time of the cessation of control or within such further times as the director may prescribe, unless at any time after such investment has been made, such investment has met the requirements for investment under any other section of this title, and the insurer has so notified the director.

F. For the purposes of this section, in determining whether an insurer's surplus as regards policyholders is reasonable in relation to the insurer's outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs, the following factors shall be considered:

#### Section 20-481.25. Acquisitions involving insurers not otherwise covered; anticompetitive considerations; civil penalty; definitions

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, this section applies to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state.

B. This section does not apply to the following, except as provided under subsections C and D of this section:

1. A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes as long as the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to cause or attempt to cause the substantial lessening of competition in any insurance market in this state. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control as defined in section 20-481, the purchase of securities is not solely for investment purposes unless the insurance director of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the disclaimer action or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary insurance director to the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions of this state.

2. The acquisition of a person by another person if both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance and if preacquisition notification is filed with the director pursuant to subsection C of this section thirty days before the proposed effective date of the acquisition. Preacquisition notification is not required if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this section by any other provision of this subsection.

3. The acquisition of already affiliated persons.

4. If, as an immediate result of an acquisition, the combined market share of the involved insurers in any market would not exceed five percent of the total market, there would not be an increase in any market share or the combined market share of the involved insurers in any market would not exceed twelve percent of the total market and the market share increases by more than two percent of the total market. For the purposes of this paragraph, "market" means direct written insurance premiums in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state.

5. An acquisition for which a preacquisition notification is required pursuant to this section because of the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business.

6. An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary insurance director finds that the insurer is failing, that there is no feasible alternative to improve the insurer's condition and that the public benefits that would result from improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would result from not lessening competition and the domiciliary insurance director communicates these findings to the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions of this state.

C. An acquisition under subsection B of this section may be subject to an order pursuant to subsection F of this section unless the acquiring person files a preacquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The acquired person may file a preacquisition notification.Â  Information submitted under this subsection is confidential. The preacquisition notification shall be in a form and contain the information that is prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners relating to those markets that are not exempt from the provisions of this section.Â  The director may require additional material and information that the director deems necessary in order to determine if the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly. The information may include an economist's opinion on the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state and a summary of the economist's education and experience that indicates the economist's ability to render an informed opinion. The waiting period begins on the date the director receives a preacquisition notification and ends thirty days after the date of receipt or on termination of the waiting period by the director, whichever is earlier. Before the waiting period ends, the director on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional information that is relevant to the proposed acquisition. The waiting period shall end thirty days after the director receives the additional information or terminates the waiting period, whichever is earlier.

D. An acquisition subject to the provisions of this section shall not substantially lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or tend to create a monopoly. The director may enter a cease and desist order under subsection F of this section if there is substantial evidence that the effect of the acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition in any line of insurance in this state or may tend to create a monopoly or if the insurer fails to file adequate information pursuant to subsection C of this section. The director has the burden of showing prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection. In determining if a proposed acquisition would lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly, the director shall consider the following:

1. An acquisition covered under subsection B of this section that involves two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection if:

(a) The market is highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following market shares:

Insurer AÂ Â  Insurer B

(i) four percent four percent or more

(ii) ten percent two percent or more

(iii) fifteen percentÂ  one percent or more

(b) The market is not highly concentrated and the involved insurers possess the following market shares:

Insurer AÂ Â  Insurer B

(i) five percent five percent or more

(ii) ten percent four percent or more

(iii) fifteen percentÂ  three percent or more

(iv) nineteen percentÂ  one percent or more

A highly concentrated market is a market in which the share of the four largest insurers is seventy-five percent or more of the market. Percentages not shown in the tables are interpolated proportionately to the percentages that are shown. If more than two insurers are involved, exceeding the total of the two columns in the table is prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection. For the purposes of this paragraph, the insurer with the largest market share is deemed to be insurer A.

2. A significant trend toward increased concentration exists if the aggregate market share of any grouping of the largest insurers in the market, from the two largest to the eight largest, has increased by seven percent or more of the market over a period of time that extends from a base year five to ten years before the acquisition up to the time of the acquisition. Any acquisition or merger under subsection B of this section that involves two or more insurers competing in the same market is prima facie evidence of a violation of this subsection if:

(a) There is a significant trend toward increased concentration in the market.

Based on the submitted plan or other information, the director shall specify the conditions, if any, that would remedy the aspects of the acquisition causing the violation and shall vacate or modify the order. An order does not apply if the acquisition is not consummated.

H. An order shall not be entered under subsection F of this section if:

B. Every director or officer of an insurance holding company system who knowingly violates, participates in, assents to or permits an officer or agent of the insurer to engage in transactions or make investments that have not been properly reported or submitted pursuant to section 20-481.02, 20-481.05 or 20-481.09 or who violates this article in his individual capacity after notice and a hearing shall pay a civil penalty of not more than ten thousand dollars for each violation. In determining the amount of the civil penalty, the director shall consider the appropriateness of the penalty with respect to the gravity of the violation, the history of previous violations and other matters as justice may require.

C. If it appears to the director that an insurer subject to this article or a director, officer, employee or agent of the insurer has engaged in a transaction or entered into a contract that is subject to this article and that would not have been approved had such approval been requested, the director may order the insurer to cease and desist immediately any further activity under that transaction or contract.

No insurance holding company system shall pay a fine on behalf of an officer, director or employee found guilty under this subsection.

F. Whenever it appears to the director that any person has committed a violation of section 20-481.02 and that violation prevents a full understanding by the director of the enterprise risk to the insurer by affiliates or by the insurance holding company system, the violation may serve as an independent basis for disapproving dividends or distributions and for placing the insurer under an order of supervision in accordance section 20-169.

 

#### Section 20-481.27. Recovery; liability

A. If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a domestic insurer has been entered, the receiver appointed under that order has a right to recover on behalf of the insurer from any parent corporation, holding company or person or affiliate that otherwise controlled the insurer the amount of distributions, other than distributions of shares of the same class of stock, paid by the insurer on its capital stock or to recover any payment in the form of a bonus, termination settlement or extraordinary lump sum salary adjustment made by the insurer or its subsidiary to a director, officer or employee if the distribution or payment is made at any time during the year preceding the petition for liquidation, conservation or rehabilitation, subject to the limitations of subsections B, C and D.

B. No distribution is recoverable if the parent or affiliate shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.

C. A person who was a parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled the insurer or affiliate at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of the distributions or payments the person received. A person who otherwise controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared is liable up to the amount of distributions he would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they are jointly and severally liable.

D. The maximum amount recoverable under this section is the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer and to reimburse any guaranty funds.

E. To the extent that a person liable under subsection C is insolvent or otherwise fails to pay claims due from it, its parent corporation or holding company or a person who otherwise controlled it at the time the distribution was paid is jointly and severally liable for a resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the parent corporation or holding company or person who otherwise controlled it.

#### Section 20-481.28. Insurer's license; revocation; suspension; nonrenewal

If it appears to the director that a person has committed a violation of this article which makes the continued operation of an insurer contrary to the interests of policyholders or the public, the director, after giving notice and an opportunity to be heard, may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew the insurer's license or authority to do business in this state for a period he finds is required for the protection of policyholders or the public. The director shall accompany this determination by specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.

A. If it appears to the director that an insurer or a director, officer, employee or agent has committed or is about to commit a violation of this article or of a rule adopted or order issued by the director, the director may apply to the superior court in the county in which the principal office of the insurer is located for an injunction and for other equitable relief as the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public may require. If the insurer has no office in this state, the director may apply to the superior court in Maricopa county.

B. No security that is the subject of any agreement or arrangement regarding acquisition or that is acquired or to be acquired, in contravention of the provisions of this article or of any rule adopted or order issued by the director may be voted at any shareholder's meeting or may be counted for quorum purposes. Any action of shareholders requiring the affirmative vote of a percentage of shares may be taken as though these securities were not issued and outstanding. No action taken at any meeting may be invalidated by the voting of these securities unless the action would materially affect control of the insurer or unless the courts of this state have so ordered. If an insurer or the director has reason to believe that any security of the insurer has been or is about to be acquired in contravention of the provisions of this article or of any rule adopted or order issued by the director, the insurer or the director may apply to the superior court in the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business to enjoin any offer, request, invitation, agreement or acquisition made in violation of this article or any rule adopted or order issued by the director to enjoin the voting of any security so acquired, to void any vote of the security already cast at any meeting of shareholders and for other equitable relief as the nature of the case and the interest of the insurer's policyholders, creditors and shareholders or the public requires.

C. In any case in which a person has acquired or is proposing to acquire any voting securities in violation of this article or any rule adopted or order issued by the director, the superior court in Maricopa county or the superior court in the county in which the insurer has its principal place of business, on notice as the court deems appropriate and on the application of the insurer or the director, may seize or sequester voting securities of the insurer owned directly or indirectly by that person and issue an order as is appropriate to effectuate the provisions of this article.

D. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, for the purposes of this section the situs of the ownership of the securities of domestic insurers is deemed to be in this state.

The court shall conduct its review without a jury and by trial de novo, except that if all parties, including the director, so stipulate, the review shall be confined to the record. Portions of the record may be introduced by stipulation into evidence in a trial de novo as to those parties so stipulating.

B. The filing of an appeal pursuant to this section shall stay the application of any such rule, regulation, order or other action of the director to the appealing party unless the court, after giving such party notice and an opportunity to be heard, determines that such a stay would be detrimental to the interest of policyholders, shareholders, creditors or the public.

C. Any person aggrieved by any failure of the director to act or make a determination required by this article may institute proceedings for a special action in the superior court in Maricopa county directing the director to act or make such determination.

Â Such limitation on the transfer of membership or rights arising from membership does not restrict the assignment of a policy that is otherwise permissible. A member of a mutual holding company is not personally liable for the acts, debts, liabilities or obligations of the mutual holding company merely by reason of being a member. An assessment of any kind may not be imposed on a member of a mutual holding company. Any premium due under an insurance policy or contract issued to a member of a mutual holding company is not considered an assessment.

G. The articles of incorporation of a mutual holding company shall contain all the following provisions:

1. The name of the mutual holding company. The name shall include the words "mutual holding company" or "mutual insurance holding company" or other words connoting the mutual character of the mutual holding company that are approved by the director.

2. A provision specifying that the mutual holding company is not authorized to issue capital stock, whether voting or nonvoting.

3. A provision setting forth any rights of the members of the mutual holding company on dissolution or liquidation.

H. A mutual holding company shall automatically be a party to any rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding involving the converted stock insurer that as a result of a reorganization is a direct or indirect subsidiary of the mutual holding company. In such a proceeding, the assets of the mutual holding company shall be counted as assets of the estate of the converted stock insurer for the purpose of satisfying the claims of the policyholders of the converted stock insurer.

 

#### Section 20-482.06. Concurrent reorganization with a domestic or foreign mutual insurer

The concurrent reorganization of a domestic mutual insurer with one or more mutual insurers, domestic or foreign, into a single mutual insurance holding company, whether domestic or foreign, may be accomplished by a joint application and a joint plan of reorganization and may be approved by the director by complying with the requirements of this article. The director may determine that such other procedures are unnecessary to avoid duplicative costs and efforts in satisfying the requirements of this article and effectuating the reorganization.

 

#### Section 20-482.07. Foreign mutual insurer reorganization; definition

A. A foreign mutual insurer organized under the laws of any other state, that, if a domestic corporation, would be organized under section 20-709, may reorganize by merging its policyholders' membership interests into an existing domestic mutual holding company in accordance with the requirements of any other law or regulation that applies to the foreign mutual insurer. The reorganization shall continue the corporate existence of the converting mutual insurer as a foreign stock insurance company subsidiary of the existing domestic mutual holding company or as a foreign stock insurance company subsidiary of an intermediate stock holding company. The reorganizing foreign mutual insurer may remain a foreign insurer after the restructuring and may be admitted to do business in this state if it meets the applicable requirements of this title. A foreign mutual insurer that is a party to the reorganization may at the same time redomesticate to this state by complying with the applicable requirements of this state and the foreign mutual insurer's state of domicile.

B. For the purposes of this section, "existing domestic mutual holding company" means a mutual holding company formed under this article.

I. After July 1, 1974, any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with subsection H of this section on a specified date before January 1, 1979, which shall be the operative date of subsection H of this section for that insurer if the insurer elects a different operative date for individual annuity and pure endowment contracts from the date that is elected for group annuity and pure endowment contracts. If an insurer does not make an election pursuant to this subsection, the operative date of subsection L of this section shall be January 1, 1979.

J. The minimum standard by calendar year of issue shall be computed as follows:

1. The interest rates that are used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of the following shall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this subsection:

(a) All life insurance policies that are issued in a particular calendar year on or after the operative date of section 20-1231.01.

(c) All annuities and pure endowments that are purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1983 under group annuity and pure endowment contracts.

(d) The net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1983 in the amounts that are held under guaranteed interest contracts.

2. As used in this paragraph:

(a) R1 is the lesser of R and 0.09, R2 is the greater of R and 0.09, R is the reference interest rate defined in this subsection and W is the weighting factor defined in this subsection, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, or I, shall be determined as follows and the results shall be rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one per cent:

(i) For life insurance:

I = .03 + W(R1 - .03) + W/2 (R2 - .09).

(ii) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options:

I = .03 + W(R - .03).

(iii) Except pursuant to item (ii) of this subdivision, for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on an issue year basis, the formula for life insurance under item (i) of this subdivision applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations of more than ten years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities under item (ii) of this subdivision applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations of ten years or less.

(iv) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities under item (ii) of this subdivision applies.

(v) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities under item (ii) of this subdivision applies.

(b) If the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this subdivision differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one per cent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for those life insurance policies shall be equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For the purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980 using the reference interest rate defined in 1979 and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of the operative date of section 20-1231.01.

3. For the purposes of this subsection, the weighting factors referred to in the formulas stated above are given in the following tables:

(a) Weighting factors for life insurance:

Guarantee

DurationÂ Â Â  Weighting

(Years)Â Â Â Â  Factors

Ten years or less .50

More than ten years, but not more than 20 years .45

More than twenty yearsÂ  .35

(b) For life insurance under subdivision (a) of this paragraph, the guarantee duration is the maximum number of years the life insurance can remain in force on a basis guaranteed in the policy or under options to convert to plans of life insurance with premium rates or nonforfeiture values, or both, that are guaranteed in the original policy.

(c) The weighting factor for single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options: .80

(d) Except pursuant to subdivision (c) of this paragraph, weighting factors for other annuities and for guaranteed interest are as specified and in accordance with this subdivision:

(i) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis:

GuaranteeÂ Â  Weighting Factor

DurationÂ Â Â  for plan type

(Years)Â Â Â Â  A B C

Five years or lessÂ Â Â Â Â  .80 .60 .50

Plan type

AÂ Â Â Â Â  BÂ Â Â Â  C

.15 .25 .05

(iii) For annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on an issue year basis other than those with no cash settlement options that do not guarantee interest on considerations received more than one year after issue or purchase and for annuities and guaranteed interest contracts valued on a change in fund basis that do not guarantee interest rates on considerations received more than twelve months after the valuation date, the factors shown in item (i) of this subdivision or derived in item (ii) of this subdivision increased by

Plan type

A Â Â Â Â Â  BÂ Â Â Â  C

.05 .05 .05

(iv) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years for which the contract guarantees interest rates in excess of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies with guarantee duration of more than twenty years. For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the guarantee duration is the number of years from the date of issue or date of purchase to the date annuity benefits are scheduled to begin.

(v) A company may elect to value guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options and annuities with cash settlement options on either an issue year basis or on a change in fund basis. Guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options and other annuities with no cash settlement options shall be valued on an issue year basis. As used in this subsection, "issue year basis" means a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard for the entire duration of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of issue or year of purchase of the annuity or guaranteed interest contract and "change in fund basis" means a valuation basis under which the interest rate used to determine the minimum valuation standard applicable to each change in the fund held under the annuity or guaranteed interest contract is the calendar year valuation interest rate for the year of the change in the fund.

4. "Plan type" as used in paragraph 3, subdivision (d) of this subsection means:

(a) Plan type A: A policyholder may withdraw funds at any time only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the insurance company received the funds, without an adjustment but in installments over a period of five years or more, as an immediate life annuity, or a policyholder may not withdraw funds.

(b) Plan type B: Before the interest rate guarantee expires, a policyholder may withdraw funds only with an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the insurance company received the funds, without an adjustment but in installments over a period of five years or more, or a policyholder may not withdraw funds. At the end of the interest rate guarantee, a policyholder may withdraw funds without an adjustment in a single sum or in installments over a period of less than five years.

(c) Plan type C: A policyholder may withdraw funds before the interest rate guarantee expires in a single sum or in installments over a period of less than five years either without an adjustment to reflect changes in interest rates or asset values since the insurance company received the funds or subject only to a fixed surrender charge that is stipulated in the contract as a percentage of the fund.

5. For the purposes of this subsection, "reference interest rate" means:

(a) For all life insurance, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year next preceding the year of issue, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(b) For single premium immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or year of purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(c) Except pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph, for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on an issue year basis, with guarantee duration of more than ten years, the lesser of the average over a period of thirty-six months and the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(d) Except pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph, for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on a year of issue basis, with guaranteed duration of ten years or less, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(e) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of issue or purchase, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

(f) Except pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph, for other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options that are valued on a change in fund basis, the average over a period of twelve months, ending on June 30 of the calendar year of the change in the fund, of the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds, as published by Moody's investors service, incorporated.

6. If Moody's investors service, incorporated no longer publishes the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds or if the national association of insurance commissioners determines that the monthly average of the composite yield on seasoned corporate bonds as published by Moody's investor service, incorporated is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate that the national association of insurance commissioners adopts and the director approves may be substituted.

K. The reserve valuation method for life insurance and endowment benefits shall be determined as follows:

1. Except as otherwise provided in subsections L, O and Q of this section, reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums, are the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by those policies, over the present value of any future modified net premiums. The modified net premiums for any one policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subdivision (a) over subdivision (b) of this paragraph as follows:

(a) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due, provided however that the net level annual premium shall not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of such policy.

(b) A net one year term premium for the benefits that are provided for in the first policy year.

2. Any life insurance policy that is issued on or after January 1, 1986 for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and that provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined for the purposes of this paragraph as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium, except as otherwise provided in subsection O of this section, shall be the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in paragraph 1 of this subsection and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with:

(a) The value defined in paragraph 1, subdivision (a) of this subsection being reduced by fifteen per cent of the amount of the excess first year premium.

(b) All present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date.

(c) The policy being assumed to mature on the date as an endowment.

(d) The cash surrender value provided on the date being considered as an endowment benefit.

In making the above comparison the mortality and interest bases stated in subsections G and J of this section shall be used.

3. Reserves according to the commissioners reserve valuation method for:

(a) Life insurance policies providing for a varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums.

(b) Group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation that is established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the internal revenue code, as amended.

(c) Disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts.

(d) All other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection.

L. The reserve valuation method for annuity and pure endowment benefits shall be determined as follows:

1. This subsection applies to all annuity and pure endowment contracts other than group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation that is established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the internal revenue code, as amended.

2. Reserves according to the commissioners annuity reserve method for benefits under annuity or pure endowment contracts, excluding any disability and accidental death benefits in those contracts, shall be the greatest of the respective excesses of the present values, at the date of valuation, of the future guaranteed benefits, including guaranteed nonforfeiture benefits that are provided for by the contracts at the end of each respective contract year, over the present value, at the date of valuation, of any future valuation considerations derived from future gross considerations, required by the terms of the contract, that become payable before the end of the respective contract year. The future guaranteed benefits shall be determined by using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate or rates specified in the contracts for determining guaranteed benefits. The valuation considerations are the portions of the respective gross considerations applied under the terms of the contracts to determine nonforfeiture values.

M. A company's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, that are issued on or after the operative date of section 20-1231, shall not be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in subsections K, L, O and P of this section and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for the policies. The aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts and benefits shall not be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the qualified actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection E of this section.

N. Optional reserves may be calculated as follows:

1. At the option of the insurer, reserves for all policies and contracts that are issued before the operative date of section 20-1231 may be calculated according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately before that date.

2. At the option of the insurer, reserves for any category of policies, contracts or benefits that the director establishes and that are issued on or after the operative date of section 20-1231 may be calculated according to any standards that produce greater aggregate reserves for that category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this section, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall not be greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided for in the policy or contract.

3. An insurer that at any time has adopted any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided by this section, with the director's approval, may adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum provided by this section. For the purposes of this section, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by subsection E of this section shall not be deemed to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation.

O. Reserves when the valuation net premium exceeds the gross premium charged shall be calculated as follows:

1. If in any contract year the gross premium charged by a company on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for the policy or contract shall be the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for the policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this subsection are those standards stated in subsections G and J of this section.

2. For any life insurance policy that is issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the gross premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for that excess and that provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination in an amount greater than the excess premium, this subsection applies as if the method actually used in calculating the reserve for the policy was the method described in subsection K, paragraphs 1 and 3 of this section. The minimum reserve at each policy anniversary of such a policy shall be the greater of the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with subsection K of this section, including paragraph 2 of that subsection, and the minimum reserve calculated in accordance with this subsection.

P. If a plan of life insurance provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or if the minimum reserves of a plan of life insurance or annuity cannot be determined by the methods described in subsections K, L and O of this section, the reserves that are held under any plan must:

1. Be appropriate in relation to the benefits and the pattern of premiums for that plan.

#### Section 20-629. Priority of distribution; definition

A. In a delinquency proceeding against an insurer domiciled in this state, the priority of distribution of claims from the general assets of the insurer shall be determined pursuant to this section. Every claim in each class shall be paid in full or adequate funds shall be reserved for the payment before the members of the next class may receive any payment.Â  Subclasses may not be established within any class. The order of distribution is as follows:

1. The costs and expenses of administration incurred in connection with the delinquency proceedings.

2. Claims of the Arizona property and casualty insurance guaranty fund established pursuant to section 20-662 and the life and disability insurance guaranty fund established pursuant to section 20-683 or a similar organization in another state to the extent the organization provides substantially similar protection with respect to the same kinds of insurance, including claims for unallocated loss adjustment expenses and general administrative costs and expenses.

3. Claims under insurance policies and contracts and guaranteed investment contracts except reinsurance, including claims under nonassessable policies for unearned premiums, claims under annuity contracts, third-party claims against insureds who are covered under liability insurance policies and, in a delinquency proceeding of a health care services organization that is domiciled in this state, claims of enrollees and enrollees' beneficiaries and any claim of a provider for services that are provided pursuant to and covered by a health care plan.

4. Claims of the federal government, except those claims under paragraph 3 of this subsection and claims that are treated as secured claims.

5. Claims for compensation actually owing to employees of the insurer, other than its officers, for services rendered to the insurer.Â  This priority is in lieu of any other similar priority authorized by law as to wages or compensation of employees.

6. Claims of any state or local government, except those claims under paragraph 3 of this subsection and claims that are treated as secured claims.

7. Claims of other general creditors that do not fall within any other priority under this section.

8. Claims that are filed after the date specified for filing proofs of claim pursuant to section 20-640.

9. Claims of surplus note or certificate of contribution holders or other similar obligations and for premium refunds on assessable policies.

10. Claims of shareholders, members or other owners in that capacity.

B. In a delinquency proceeding against an insurer domiciled in this state, the priority of claims against the general assets of the insurer shall be determined pursuant to this section regardless of where the claimant resides or where the assets are located.

C. In a delinquency proceeding against an insurer domiciled in a reciprocal state, claims owing to residents of this state shall be preferred if like claims are preferred by the laws of that state.

D. The owners of special deposit claims against an insurer for which a receiver is appointed in this or any other state shall be given priority against their several special deposits, including without limitation assets comprising the applicable separate account, in accordance with the provisions of the statutes governing the creation and maintenance of such deposits. If there is a deficiency in any such deposit so that the claims secured are not fully discharged, the claimants may share in the general assets, but such sharing shall be deferred until general creditors, all other persons who are entitled to priority under subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section, and also claimants against other special deposits who have received smaller percentages from their respective special deposits have been paid percentages of their claims equal to the percentage paid from the special deposit, subject to the applicable terms of any variable life contract, variable annuity contract or guaranteed investment contract that is supported by a separate account to the extent it is guaranteed by the general account. This subsection shall not be applied in a manner that would reduce the value of any general account guaranty.

E. The owner of a secured claim against an insurer for which a receiver has been appointed in this or any other state may surrender the owner's security and file the owner's claim as a general creditor, or the claim may be discharged by resort to the security, in which case the deficiency, if any, shall be treated as a claim against the general assets of the insurer on the same basis as claims of unsecured creditors. If the amount of the deficiency has been adjudicated in ancillary proceedings as provided in this article or if it has been adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction in proceedings in which the domiciliary receiver has had notice and opportunity to be heard, such amounts shall be conclusive. Â Otherwise the amount shall be determined in the delinquency proceeding in the domiciliary state.

F. For the purposes of this section, "health care plan" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-1051.

#### Section 20-630. Attachment and garnishment of assets

A. During the pendency of delinquency proceedings in this or any reciprocal state, an action or proceeding in the nature of an attachment, garnishment or execution may not be commenced or maintained in the courts of this state against the delinquent insurer or its assets. Any lien obtained by any such action or proceeding within four months before the commencement of any such delinquency proceeding or at any time thereafter is void as against any rights arising in the delinquency proceeding.

The receiver may deposit such monies or any part thereof in a national bank or trust company as a trust fund.

#### Section 20-634. Borrowing on pledge of assets

For the purpose of facilitating the rehabilitation, liquidation, conservation or dissolution of an insurer pursuant to this article, the receiver may, subject to the approval of the court, borrow money and execute, acknowledge and deliver notes or other evidences of indebtedness therefor and secure its repayment by the mortgage, pledge, assignment, transfer in trust or hypothecation of any or all of the property, whether real, personal or mixed, of the insurer, and the receiver, subject to the approval of the court, may take any and all other action necessary and proper to consummate the loan and to provide for the repayment thereof. The receiver is under no obligation personally or in the receiver's official capacity to repay any loan made pursuant to this section.

B. Every director, officer, employee, stockholder, member and subscriber and any other person acting on behalf of the insurer who is concerned in any such act or deed and every person receiving thereby any property of the insurer or the benefit thereof shall be personally liable therefor and shall be bound to account to the receiver.

C. The receiver in any proceeding under this article may avoid any transfer of or lien on the property of an insurer that any creditor, stockholder, subscriber or member of the insurer might have avoided and may recover the property so transferred unless the person was a bona fide holder for value before the date of the granting of an order to show cause under this article. Such property or its value may be recovered from anyone who has received it except a bona fide holder for value as specified in this article.

D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a receiver, rehabilitator, liquidator or conservator may not void any transfer of, or any obligation to transfer, money or other property arising under or in connection with any federal home loan bank security agreement with an insurer member, or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee agreement or any other similar arrangement or credit enhancement relating to a federal home loan bank security agreement with an insurer member unless the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either existing or future creditors.

#### Section 20-637. Qualified financial contracts; definition

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a person shall not be enjoined or prohibited from exercising:

1. A contractual right to cause the termination, liquidation, acceleration or close out of obligations under or in connection with any netting agreement or qualified financial contract with an insurer because of either:

(a) The insolvency, financial condition or default of the insurer at any time if the right is enforceable under applicable law other than this article.

(b) The commencement of a formal delinquency proceeding under this article.

2. Any right under a pledge, security, collateral, reimbursement or guarantee agreement or arrangement or any other similar security agreement or arrangement or other credit enhancement relating to one or more netting agreements or qualified financial contracts.

3. Subject to section 20-638, subsection B, any right to offset or net out any termination value, payment amount or other transfer obligation arising under or in connection with one or more qualified financial contracts where the counterparty or its guarantor is organized under the laws of the United States or a state or a foreign jurisdiction approved by the securities valuation office of the national association of insurance commissioners as eligible for netting.

B. If a counterparty to a master netting agreement or a qualified financial contract with an insurer subject to a proceeding under this article terminates, liquidates, closes out or accelerates the agreement or contract, damages shall be measured as of the date or dates of termination, liquidation, close out or acceleration. The amount of a claim for damages shall be actual direct compensatory damages calculated pursuant to subsection H of this section.

C. On termination of a netting agreement or qualified financial contract, the net or settlement amount owed by a nondefaulting party to an insurer against which a proceeding under this article has been commenced shall be transferred to or on the order of the receiver for the insurer, even if the insurer is the defaulting party, notwithstanding any walkaway clause in the netting agreement or qualified financial contract. Any limited two-way payment or first method provision in a netting agreement or qualified financial contract with an insurer that has defaulted shall be deemed to be a full two-way payment or second method provision as against the defaulting insurer. Any such property or amount shall be a general asset of the insurer, except to the extent it is subject to one or more secondary liens or encumbrances or rights of netting or offset. For the purposes of this subsection, "walkaway clause" means a provision in a netting agreement or a qualified financial contract that, after calculation of a value of a party's position or an amount due to or from one of the parties in accordance with its terms on termination, liquidation or acceleration of the netting agreement or qualified financial contract, either does not create a payment obligation of a party or extinguishes a payment obligation of a party in whole or in part solely because of the party's status as a nondefaulting party.

D. In making any transfer of a netting agreement or qualified financial contract of an insurer subject to a proceeding under this article, the receiver shall either:

1. Transfer to one party, other than an insurer subject to a proceeding under this article, all netting agreements and qualified financial contracts between a counterparty or any affiliate of the counterparty and the insurer that is the subject of the proceeding including:

(a) All rights and obligations of each party under each netting agreement and qualified financial contract.

(b) All property, including any guarantees or other credit enhancement, securing any claims of each party under each netting agreement and qualified financial contract.

2. Transfer none of the netting agreements, qualified financial contracts, rights, obligations or property referred to in paragraph 1 of this subsection with respect to the counterparty and any affiliate of the counterparty.

E. If the receiver makes a transfer of one or more netting agreements or qualified financial contracts, the receiver shall use its best efforts to notify any person who is a party to the netting agreements or qualified financial contracts of the transfer by noon in the receiver's local time on the business day following the transfer. For the purposes of this subsection, "business day" means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which either the New York stock exchange or the federal reserve bank of New York is closed.

F. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the receiver may not avoid a transfer of money or other property arising under or in connection with a netting agreement or qualified financial contract or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee agreement or any other similar security arrangement or credit support document relating to a netting agreement or qualified financial contract that is made before the commencement of a delinquency proceeding under this article.Â  However, a transfer may be avoided under section 20-636, subsection C if the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud the insurer, a receiver appointed for the insurer or existing or future creditors.

G. In disaffirming or repudiating any netting agreement or qualified financial contract to which an insurer is a party, the receiver for the insurer shall either:

1. Disaffirm or repudiate all netting agreements and qualified financial contracts between a counterparty or any affiliate of the counterparty and the insurer that is the subject of the proceeding.

2. Disaffirm or repudiate none of the netting agreements and qualified financial contracts referred to in paragraph 1 of this subsection with respect to the person or any affiliate of the person.

H. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, any claim of a counterparty against the estate arising from the receiver's disaffirmance or repudiation of a netting agreement or qualified financial contract that has not been previously affirmed in the proceeding under this article shall be determined and shall be allowed or disallowed as if the claim had arisen before the date of the commencement of a proceeding under this article.Â  The amount of the claim shall be the actual direct compensatory damages determined as of the date of the disaffirmance or repudiation of the netting agreement or qualified financial contract.Â  For the purposes of this subsection, "actual direct compensatory damages":

1. Does not include punitive or exemplary damages, damages for lost profit or lost opportunity or damages for pain and suffering.

2. Includes normal and reasonable costs of cover or other reasonable measures of damages used in the derivatives, securities or other market for the contract and agreement claims.

I. This section does not apply to persons who are affiliates of the insurer that is the subject of the proceeding.

J. All rights of counterparties under this article apply to netting agreements and qualified financial contracts entered into on behalf of the general account or separate accounts if the assets of each separate account are available only to counterparties to netting agreements and qualified financial contracts entered into on behalf of that separate account.

K. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a federal home loan bank may not be stayed, enjoined or prohibited from exercising or enforcing any right or cause of action against collateral pledged by an insurer member under any federal home loan bank security agreement or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee agreement or other similar arrangement or credit enhancement relating to a security agreement to which that federal home loan bank is a party.

L. For the purposes of this section, "contractual right" includes:

1. Any right set forth:

A. In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the insurer and another person in connection with any action or proceeding under this article, such credits and debts shall be set off and the balance only shall be allowed or paid, except as provided in subsection B of this section.

B. No offset shall be allowed in favor of any such person where the obligation of the insurer to such person would not at the date of the entry of any liquidation order or otherwise as provided in section 20-635, entitle him to share as a claimant in the assets of the insurer, or the obligation of the insurer to such person was purchased by or transferred to such person with a view of its being used as an offset, or the obligation of such person is to pay an assessment levied against the members of a mutual insurer or against the subscribers of a reciprocal insurer or is to pay a balance upon the subscription to the capital stock of a stock insurer.

#### Section 20-639. Allowance of certain claims

A. No contingent claim shall share in a distribution of the assets of an insurer which has been adjudicated to be insolvent by an order made pursuant to this article, except that such claim shall be considered, if properly presented, and may be allowed to share where either:

1. Such claim becomes absolute against the insurer on or before the last day for filing proof of claims against the assets of such insurer.

2. There is a surplus and the liquidation is thereafter conducted upon the basis that such insurer is solvent.

B. Where an insurer has been so adjudicated to be insolvent any person who has a cause of action against an insured of such insurer under a liability insurance policy issued by such insurer shall have the right to file a claim in the liquidation proceeding, regardless of the fact that the claim may be contingent, and the claim may be allowed if all of the following requirements are met:

1. If it may be reasonably inferred from the proof presented upon the claim that the person would be able to obtain a judgment upon the cause of action against the insured.

2. If the person furnishes suitable proof, unless the court for good cause shown otherwise directs, that no further valid claim against the insurer arising out of his cause of action other than those already presented can be made.

3. If the total liability of the insurer to all claimants arising out of the same act of its insured shall be no greater than its maximum liability would be were it not in liquidation.

C. No judgment against such an insured taken after the date of entry of the liquidation order shall be considered in the liquidation proceedings as evidence of liability, or of the amount of damages, and no judgment against an insured taken by default or by collusion prior to the entry of the liquidation order shall be considered as conclusive evidence in the liquidation proceedings, either of the liability of the insured to such person upon the cause of action or of the amount of damages to which the person is therein entitled.

D. No claim of any secured claimant shall be allowed at a sum greater than the difference between the value of the claim without security and the value of the security itself as of the date of the entry of the order of liquidation or such other date set by the court for determining rights and liabilities as provided in section 20-635 unless the claimant surrenders the claimant's security to the receiver, in which event the claim shall be allowed in the full amount for which it is valued.

#### Section 20-640. Time to file claims

A. If, upon the granting of an order of liquidation under this article or at any time thereafter during the liquidation proceeding, the insurer is not clearly solvent, the court shall, after such notice and hearing as it deems proper, make an order declaring the insurer to be insolvent. Thereupon regardless of any prior notice which may have been given to creditors, the receiver shall notify all persons who may have claims against the insurer and who have not filed proper proofs thereof to present them to him, at a place specified in the notice, within four months from the date of entry of the order, or if the receiver certifies that it is necessary, within such longer time as the court shall prescribe. The last day for filing of proofs of claims shall be specified in the notice, and notice shall be given in a manner to be determined by the court.

B. Proofs of claim may be filed subsequent to the date specified, but no such claim shall share in the distribution of the assets until all allowed claims, proofs of which have been filed before such date, have been paid in full with interest according to the priorities established in section 20-629.

B. The assessment or assessments shall cover the excess of the probable liabilities over the reasonable value of the assets, together with the estimated cost of collection and percentage of uncollectibility thereof. The total of all assessments against any member or subscriber with respect to any policy, whether levied pursuant to this article or pursuant to any other provision of this title, shall be for no greater amount than that specified in the policy or policies of the member or subscriber and as limited under this title, except that if the court finds that the policy was issued at a rate of premium below the minimum rate lawfully permitted for the risk insured, the court may determine the upper limit of the assessment upon the basis of the minimum rate.

C. No assessment shall be levied against any member or subscriber with respect to any nonassessable policy issued in accordance with this title.

#### Section 20-643. Order to pay assessment

To the extent such company deems it necessary to comply with any applicable federal or state laws, such company, with respect to any separate account, including without limitation any separate account that is a management investment company or a unit investment trust, may provide for persons having an interest in the account appropriate voting and other rights and special procedures for the conduct of the business of such account, including without limitation special rights and procedures relating to investment policy, investment advisory services, selection of independent public accountants, and the selection of a committee, the members of which need not be otherwise affiliated with such company, to manage the business of such account.

H. No company shall deliver or issue for delivery within this state variable contracts unless it is licensed or organized to do a life insurance or annuity business in this state, and the director is satisfied that its condition or methods of operation in connection with the issuance of such variable contracts will not render its operation hazardous to the public or its policyholders in this state.

#### Section 20-666. Assessments; notification; exemptions; setoffs; refunds

A. The board shall assess each member insurer, as a condition of such insurer's authority to transact insurance in this state, in such amounts as are necessary to pay the obligations of the fund pursuant to section 20-667 subsequent to an insolvency, the expenses of handling covered claims subsequent to an insolvency, the cost of examinations and other expenses authorized pursuant to this article.

B. The assessment of each member insurer shall be in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of the member insurer for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account. The board shall notify each member insurer of the assessment not later than thirty days before it is due. No member insurer may be assessed in any year on any account an amount greater than one per cent of such member insurer's net direct written premiums for the preceding calendar year on the kinds of insurance in the account.

C. Except for the workers' compensation insurance account, if the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the fund in any account, does not provide in any one year in any account an amount sufficient to make all necessary payments from such account, the funds available may be prorated and the unpaid portion shall be paid as soon as funds become available. The board shall pay claims in any order which it may deem reasonable, including the payment of claims as such claims are received from the claimants or in groups or categories of claims.

D. The board may exempt or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of any member insurer, if the assessment would cause the member insurer's financial statement to reflect amounts of capital or surplus less than the minimum amounts required for a certificate of authority by any jurisdiction in which the member insurer is authorized to transact insurance.

E. Each member insurer serving as a servicing facility may set off against any assessment, authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of such claims by the member insurer if they are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made.

F. In addition to all other assessments, the board may assess each member insurer in an amount not to exceed two hundred dollars per year for the purpose of paying for operating expenses of the board and employees of the board.

G. If, at the end of any calendar year, the board finds that the assets of the fund in any account exceed the liabilities of such account as estimated by the board for the coming year, the board may refund to the member insurers in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to such account the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the liabilities. All refunds will be contingent upon the return of a member insurer's certificate(s) of contribution and will be in an amount equal to the premium tax offset value of the relinquished certificate.

 

#### Section 20-667. Obligations of the fund

A. The fund is obligated solely to the extent of the covered claims existing during any of the following periods:

1. Before the determination of insolvency and arising within thirty days after the determination of insolvency.

In no event shall the fund be obligated to a policyholder or claimant in any amount in excess of the face amount of the policy from which the claim arises.

C. The fund is deemed the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims and to such extent shall have all rights, duties and obligations of the insolvent insurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent. Notwithstanding any other law, the fund is not obligated to pay any amount that does not constitute a payment of a covered claim, including taxable costs, attorney fees or interest that could be awarded or any additional liabilities or obligations that might otherwise exist or accrue against the insolvent insurer if the insurer had not become insolvent.

D. Any settlement of a covered claim that is entered into with any insured or claimant within four months before the determination of insolvency and that has not been paid is voidable by the fund for six months after the determination of the insolvency or six months after the fund discovers or should have discovered the settlement, whichever is later.

E. Notwithstanding subsection D of this section, a settlement or commutation of a workers' compensation claim approved by an award of the industrial commission that has become final pursuant to section 23-942 or 23-943 is not voidable.

F. The fund is not bound by any settlement that is more than the fund's limits of liability established by this article.

2. Suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation.

#### Section 20-672. Effect of paid claims

A. Any person recovering pursuant to this article shall be deemed to have assigned his or her rights under the policy to the fund to the extent of his or her recovery from the fund. Every insured or claimant seeking the protection of this article shall cooperate with the fund to the same extent as such person would have been required to cooperate with the insolvent insurer. The fund shall have no cause of action against the insured of the insolvent insurer for any sums it has paid.

B. The receiver, conservator, liquidator or statutory successor of an insolvent insurer shall be bound by settlement of covered claims by the fund or similar organization in another state.

C. The board shall periodically file with the receiver, conservator, liquidator or statutory successor of the insolvent insurer statements of the covered claims paid by the fund and estimates of anticipated claims on the fund which shall preserve the rights of the fund against the assets of the insolvent insurer.

#### Section 20-673. Nonduplication of recovery; exhausting all other applicable coverages; rights of fund and member insurer; definition

A. Any person having a claim against an insurer under any provision in an insurance policy that is also a covered claim shall be required to exhaust first all rights under that policy. Any amount payable on a covered claim pursuant to this article shall be reduced by the amount of the recovery under the claimant's insurance policy. Any recovery pursuant to this article shall be reduced by the amount of the recovery under the claimant's insurance policy. A member insurer or other insurer, which pays the insurer's own policy, shall have no right of subrogation or recovery against the insured of an insolvent insurer. A claimant for workers' compensation benefits shall have all rights and obligations conferred under title 23, chapter 6.

B. Any person having a claim that may be recovered under more than one insurance guaranty fund or its equivalent or who is insured under more than one policy shall first exhaust coverage from the fund of the place of residence of the insured or, if it is a first-party claim for damage to property with a permanent location, shall first exhaust coverage from the fund of the location of the property, or shall first exhaust coverage under the other policy, and if it is a workers' compensation claim, recovery shall be sought from the guaranty fund or its equivalent of the place of residence of the claimant. Any recovery pursuant to this article shall be reduced by the amount of the recovery from any other insurance guaranty fund or its equivalent or under another policy. Covered claims by subscribers of an insolvent reciprocal insurer shall not be paid until all subscribers have been assessed pursuant to section 20-791.

C. Where more than one policy may be applicable, a policy issued by the insolvent insurer shall be deemed to be excess coverage. The claimant shall be required to exhaust all rights under other applicable coverage or coverages. Any recovery pursuant to this article shall be reduced by the amount of the recovery under the claimant's insurance policy. Any amount payable on a covered claim shall be reduced by the amount of the recovery under other applicable insurance.

D. Except for workers' compensation claimants, if damages against uninsured motorists are recoverable by the claimant from the claimant's own insurer, the recoverable damages shall reduce the amount of any recovery pursuant to this article if the full amount of the uninsured motorist coverage has been exhausted. The claimant shall have no claim against the insured of the insolvent carrier or the fund if the full amount of uninsured motorist coverage was not recovered by the claimant. A member insurer shall have no right of subrogation against the insured of the insolvent carrier or against the fund for any amount paid by the insurer under uninsured motorist coverage. A member insurer may file a claim for subrogation payments under uninsured motorist coverage against the ancillary or domiciliary receiver of the insolvent insurer.

E. The fund shall receive the proceeds of any amounts recoverable on reinsurance contracts or treaties entered into by the insolvent insurer that cover any of the liabilities incurred by the insolvent insurer in the category or categories involved. The proceeds shall be limited to payments on or loss adjustment expenses or defense costs actually incurred by the fund on account of claims covered in the contracts or treaties. The director, as receiver or ancillary receiver, shall receive the proceeds of any reinsurance recoverable to the extent of payment on claims, loss adjustment expenses or defense costs made before the order of liquidation.

F. If a covered claim arises out of two or more policies to which this article applies, a recovery under one policy reduces the amount that is payable under the other policy. The fund is not liable for the payment of more than one policy on a covered claim.

G. For the purposes of this article, "exhaustion of all rights under any other policy of insurance" means the payment of the applicable policy limits or an adjudication by a court of record that no benefits are owed.

 

#### Section 20-674. Premium tax offset

A. The fund shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment pursuant to this article a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the director for the amount paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue.

B. Except for premium taxes and assessments collected pursuant to title 23, chapter 6, a certificate of contribution issued to a member insurer may be offset against the insurer's premium tax liability to this state in the amount of twenty per cent of the assessment for the year of assessment and twenty per cent of the assessment per year for each of the succeeding four years. A member shall at its option have the right to show a certificate of contribution as an asset in the form approved by the director at percentages of the original face amount approved by the director, for calendar years as follows:

1. One hundred per cent for the calendar year of issuance.

2. Eighty per cent for the first calendar year after the year of issuance.

3. Sixty per cent for the second calendar year after the year of issuance.

4. Forty per cent for the third calendar year after the year of issuance.

5. Twenty per cent for the fourth calendar year after the year of issuance.

C. Any sums available for refund, pursuant to section 20-666, from the fund that have been written off by contributing insurers and offset against premium taxes shall be paid to the director and shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund.

D. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the total amount a member insurer, as defined in section 20-661, may offset against its premium tax liability pursuant to a certificate of contribution that is issued from 1987 through 1994 shall not exceed the following percentage amounts for each certificate of contribution, except that in no event may the total amount of the offset exceed one hundred per cent of each assessment:

1. For 1992, thirteen per cent.

2. For 1993, eleven per cent.

3. For 1994, thirteen per cent.

E. No insurer may offset its premium tax liability by any amount unless the assessment for which the first year credit is claimed was collected by the guaranty fund in the calendar year for which the insurer seeks to offset its taxes.

F. Beginning in 1995, the total amount that a member insurer may offset against its premium tax liability pursuant to a certificate of contribution shall be as provided in subsection B of this section, except that in no event may the total amount of the offset exceed one hundred per cent of the assessment.

 

#### Section 20-675. Immunity and indemnification

A. There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action shall rise against, the fund, any member insurer, the board or its agents or employees, the director or representatives of the director for any action taken in the performance of their powers and duties pursuant to this article.

B. The board and its agents or employees shall be indemnified by the fund against all expenses incurred in the defense of any action, suit or proceeding brought against such person on account of any action taken in the performance of the powers and duties of such person pursuant to this article, unless such person is finally adjudged to have committed a breach of duty involving gross negligence, bad faith, dishonesty, wilful malfeasance or reckless disregard of the responsibilities of his or her office. In the event of settlement before the final adjudication, such indemnity shall be provided only if the board is advised by independent counsel selected by the board that such person did not, in the counsel's opinion, commit such a breach of duty.

C. The fund's reimbursement of such expenses of indemnification shall be prorated and paid for by the member insurers in the proportion that the net direct written premiums of each member insurer for the calendar year preceding the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding bears to the net direct written premiums of all member insurers for the preceding calendar year.

#### Section 20-676. Stay of proceedings

A. All proceedings in which the insolvent insurer or the insolvent insurer's insured is a party in any court of this state shall be stayed for six months from the date the insolvency is determined or an ancillary proceeding is instituted in this state, whichever is later, to permit proper defense by the fund of all pending causes of action as to any covered claim. At the request of any party and on a showing of good cause, the court may shorten or lengthen the stay prescribed in this section. This subsection does not apply to proceedings in which the insolvent insurer is a party to a proceeding before the industrial commission regarding an employee's entitlement to benefits under title 23, chapter 6, except that, on a showing of good cause, the industrial commission shall grant up to a ninety-day continuance of any scheduled hearing to allow the fund to assume the defense and investigate the claim.

B. On application of the fund, either on the fund's own behalf or on the insured's behalf, the court may set aside any judgment, order, decision, verdict, finding or award arising from the default of the insolvent insurer or the insurer's failure to defend the insured and the fund shall be allowed to defend the claim on the merits.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a federal home loan bank may not be stayed, enjoined or prohibited from exercising or enforcing any right or cause of action against collateral pledged by an insurer member under any federal home loan bank security agreement or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee agreement or other similar arrangement or credit enhancement relating to a security agreement to which that federal home loan bank is a party.

#### Section 20-677. Interest

All interest earned on monies held and invested by the fund shall be credited to the account from which the funds were obtained. Investments by the board shall be restricted to those investments which are permitted by insurers for statutory deposits pursuant to section 20-583.

#### Section 20-686. Assessments

A. For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the fund, the fund shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such times and for such amounts as the fund finds necessary. The member insurers shall be required to pay the assessments within the time prescribed in a written notice of the assessment to the member insurers but no less than thirty days after the date of the written notice.

B. There shall be two classes of assessments, as follows:

1. Class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative costs and other general expenses not related to a particular impaired insurer or insolvent insurer.

2. Class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the fund pursuant to section 20-685 with regard to an impaired insurer or insolvent insurer.

C. The amount of assessment for each account shall be determined as follows:

1. The amount of any class A assessment for each account shall be determined by the fund.

2. The amount of any class B assessment, except for assessments related to long-term care insurance, shall be allocated between the accounts in the proportion that the premiums received by the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer on the policies or contracts covered by each account bear to the premiums received by such insurer on all such policies or contracts.Â  The amount of the class B assessment for long-term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer shall be allocated according to a methodology included in the plan of operation and approved by the director.Â  The methodology shall provide for fifty percent of the assessment to be allocated to accident and disability member insurers and fifty percent to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers.

3. Class A and class B assessments against member insurers for each account shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies covered by each account bear to such premiums received on business in this state by all assessed member insurers.

4. Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the fund with respect to an impaired insurer or insolvent insurer shall not be made until necessary to implement the purposes of this article. Classification of assessments as prescribed pursuant to subsection B of this section and computation of assessments pursuant to this subsection shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible.

5. The total of all assessments on a member insurer for each account shall not in any one calendar year exceed two percent of that member insurer's average annual premiums received in this state on the policies and contracts covered by the account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired insurer or insolvent insurer. If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation shall be limited to the greater of the three year average annual premiums for the applicable account as calculated pursuant to this subsection.

D. The fund may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the fund, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.

E. If an assessment against a member insurer is abated or deferred, in whole or in part, because of the limitations set forth in subsection D of this section, the amount by which such assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the fund in either account, does not provide in any one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the fund, the necessary additional monies shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this article.

F. The fund, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, may refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account, the amount the fund finds is not necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the fund with regard to such amount, including assets accruing from net realized gains and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the fund and for future losses.

G. Any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policyowner dividends as to any kind of insurance or health care services organization business within the scope of this article, may consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations.

H. The fund shall issue to each member insurer paying an assessment a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the director, for the amount paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the member insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount and period of time as the director may approve.

#### Section 20-687. Plan of operation

A. The board shall submit to the director a plan of operation and any amendments necessary to assure the fair, reasonable and equitable administration of the fund. The plan of operation and any amendments shall become effective on approval in writing by the director. If the board fails to submit a plan of operation or if at any time the board fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan, the director shall adopt any plan or amendment that is necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this article and the plan or amendment shall continue in force until modified by the director or superseded by a plan submitted by the board and approved by the director.

C. The plan of operation, in addition to all other requirements, shall:

The plan of operation may provide that any or all powers and duties of the board, except those in section 20-685, subsection H, paragraph 3 and section 20-686, are delegated to any corporation, association or other organization that performs or will perform functions similar to those of this fund in two or more states. Such a corporation, association or organization shall be reimbursed for any payments made on behalf of the fund and shall be paid for its performance of any function of the fund. A delegation pursuant to this subsection shall take effect only with the approval of both the board of directors and the director and may be made only to a corporation, association or organization that extends protection not substantially less favorable and effective than that provided by this article.

3. When an impairment is declared and the amount of the impairment is determined, serve a demand on the impaired insurer to make good the impairment within a reasonable time.Â  Notice to the impaired insurer shall constitute notice to its shareholders. The failure of the impaired insurer to promptly comply with such demand shall not excuse the board from the performance of its duties pursuant to this article.

B. The director may suspend or revoke, after notice and a hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10, the certificate of authority to transact business in this state of any member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation.Â  As an alternative the director may levy a forfeiture on any member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due.Â  Such forfeiture shall not exceed five percent of the unpaid assessment per month, but no forfeiture may be less than one hundred dollars per month.

C. Any action of the board of directors may be appealed to the director by any member insurer within thirty days.Â  Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, any final action or order of the director is subject to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

#### Section 20-689. Prevention of impairments

To aid in the detection and prevention of member insurer impairments and insolvencies:

1. The board of directors, on majority vote, shall notify the director of any information indicating that any member insurer may be unable or potentially unable to fulfill its contractual obligations.

2. The board of directors, on majority vote, may request that the director order an examination of any member insurer which the board in good faith believes may be unable or potentially unable to fulfill its contractual obligations. The director may conduct such examination. The examination may be conducted as a national association of insurance commissioners examination or may be conducted by such persons as the director designates. The cost of such examination shall be paid by the fund and the examination report shall be treated as are other examination reports. The examination report shall not be released to the board of directors of the fund before its release to the public, but this shall not excuse the director from the obligation to comply with paragraph 3. The director shall notify the board of directors when the examination is completed. The request for an examination shall be kept on file by the director but it shall not be open to the public and shall be released only if the examination discloses that the examined insurer is unable or potentially unable to meet its contractual obligations.

3. The director shall report to the board of directors when the director has reasonable cause to believe that any member insurer examined at the request of the board of directors may be unable or potentially unable to fulfill its contractual obligations.

4. The board of directors, on majority vote, may make reports and recommendations to the director on any matter germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation of any member insurer. Such reports and recommendations shall not be considered public documents.

B. Records shall be kept of all negotiations and meetings in which the fund or its representatives are involved to discuss the activities of the fund in carrying out its powers and duties. Records of such negotiations or meetings shall be made public only on the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation proceeding involving the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer, on the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer or on the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

C. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations pursuant to this article, the board shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to policies reduced by any amounts to which the board is entitled as subrogee. All assets of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer attributable to policies shall be used to continue all policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer. As used in this subsection, "assets attributable to policies" means that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies or contracts bear to the reserve that should have been established for all policies of insurance or health benefit plans written by the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer.

D. Before the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties including the board, the shareholders, contract owners, certificate holders, enrollees and policyowners of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer and any other party with a bona fide interest in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of such impaired insurer or insolvent insurer. In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policyholders, contract owners, certificate holders and enrollees of the continuing or successor member insurer. No distribution to stockholders of the assets of an impaired insurer or insolvent insurer may be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the fund with interest thereon for monies expended in carrying out its powers and duties under section 20-685 with respect to such insurer is fully recovered by the fund.

E. If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a member insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under such order may recover on behalf of the member insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the member insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the following limitations:

1. No such dividend shall be recoverable if the member insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable and that the member insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations.

2. Any person who as an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were paid shall be liable up to the amount of distributions the person received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were declared shall be liable up to the amount of distributions the person would have received if they had been paid immediately. If two persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they are jointly and severally liable.

3. The maximum amount recoverable pursuant to this subsection shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the impaired insurer or insolvent insurer.

4. If any person liable pursuant to paragraph 2 is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the dividend was paid are jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.

F. The receiver, conservator, liquidator or statutory successor of an impaired insurer or insolvent insurer is bound by a settlement of covered claims by the fund or a similar organization in another state.

C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the total amount a member insurer may offset against its premium tax liability pursuant to a certificate of contribution that is issued from 1987 through 1994 shall not exceed the following percentage amounts for each certificate of contribution, except that in no event may the total amount of the offset exceed one hundred percent of each assessment:

1. For 1991, seven percent.

2. For 1992, nine percent.

3. For 1993, eleven percent.

4. For 1994, thirteen percent.

E. Beginning in 1995, the total amount that a member insurer may offset against its premium tax liability pursuant to a certificate of contribution shall be as provided in subsection B of this section, except that in no event shall the total amount of the offset exceed one hundred percent of the assessment.

As to a judgment under any decision, order, verdict or finding based on default, the board may apply to have such judgment set aside by the same court that made such judgment and shall be permitted to defend against such suit on the merits.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section or any other provision of this chapter, a receiver, rehabilitator, liquidator or conservator may not void any transfer of, or any obligation to transfer, money or other property arising under or in connection with any federal home loan bank security agreement with an insurer member, or any pledge, security, collateral or guarantee agreement or any other similar arrangement or credit enhancement relating to a federal home loan bank security agreement with an insurer member unless the transfer was made with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either existing or future creditors.

#### Section 20-695. Statute of limitations

2. The extent to which the appointed actuary uses assumptions in the asset adequacy analysis that are materially different than the assumptions used in the previous asset adequacy analysis.

3. The amount of reserves and the identity of the product lines that had been subjected to asset adequacy analysis in the prior opinion but that were not subject to analysis for the current opinion.

4. Comments on any interim results that may be of significant concern to the appointed actuary.

5. The methods used by the appointed actuary to recognize the impact of reinsurance on the company's cash flows, including both assets and liabilities, under each of the scenarios tested.

7. The name of the company for which the regulatory asset adequacy issues summary is being supplied.

8. The signature of the appointed actuary and the date of the signature.

I. The memorandum shall include the following statement:

Actuarial methods, considerations and analyses used in the preparation of this memorandum conform to the appropriate actuarial standards of practice as promulgated by the actuarial standards board that form the basis for this memorandum.

J. An appropriate allocation of assets in the amount of the interest maintenance reserve whether positive or negative, shall be used in any asset adequacy analysis.Â  Analysis of risks regarding asset default may include an appropriate allocation of assets supporting the asset valuation reserve. These asset valuation reserve assets may not be applied for any other risks with respect to reserve adequacy. Analysis of these and other risks may include assets supporting other mandatory or voluntary reserves available to the extent not used for risk analysis and reserve support.

K. The amount of the assets used for the asset valuation reserve shall be disclosed in the table of reserves and liabilities of the opinion and in the memorandum.Â  The method used for selecting particular assets or allocated portions of assets shall be disclosed in the memorandum.

L. The appointed actuary shall retain on file, for at least seven years, sufficient documentation to determine the procedures followed, the analyses performed, the bases for assumptions and the results obtained.

D. Unrealized contingent liability of members does not constitute an asset of the insurer in any determination of its financial condition.

#### Section 20-718. Enforcement of contingent liability

A. If at any time the assets of a domestic mutual insurer are less than its liabilities and the minimum amount of surplus required of it by this title for authority to transact the kinds of insurance being transacted, and the deficiency is not cured from other sources, its directors shall levy an assessment only on its members who, at any time within the twelve months immediately preceding the date notice of such assessment was mailed to them, held policies providing for contingent liability, and such members shall be liable to the insurer for the amount so assessed.

B. The assessment shall be for such an amount as is required to cure such deficiency and to provide a reasonable amount of working funds above such minimum amount of surplus, but such working funds so provided shall not exceed five percent of the insurer's liabilities as of the date on which the amount of such deficiency was determined.

C. No one policy or member as to such policy shall be assessed or charged with an aggregate of contingent liability as to obligations incurred by the insurer in any one calendar year, in excess of the number of times the premium as stated in the policy as computed solely on premium earned on such policy during that year.

#### Section 20-719. Issuance of nonassessable policies by mutual insurers

A. While it maintains on deposit with the state treasurer through the director surplus funds in an amount not less than the paid-in capital required of a domestic stock insurer transacting like kinds of insurance, a domestic mutual insurer may extinguish the contingent liability of its members as to all its policies in force, and may omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all its policies currently issued.

B. When such surplus funds have been so deposited and the director has so ascertained, he shall issue to the insurer at its request his certificate authorizing such extinguishment and omission of contingent liability.

Any such classification or determination shall be reasonable, and shall not unfairly discriminate as between policyholders within the same such classification. A life insurer may issue both participating and nonparticipating policies only if the right or absence of right to participate is reasonably related to the premium charged.

B. Except as to a nonassessable policy each subscriber shall have a contingent assessment liability, in the amount provided for in the power of attorney or in the subscribers' agreement, for payment of actual losses and expenses incurred while his policy was in force.

#### Section 20-785. Time limit for assessment

Every subscriber of a domestic reciprocal insurer having contingent liability shall be liable for, and shall pay his share of any assessment, as computed and limited in accordance with this article, if:

1. While his policy is in force or within one year after its termination, he is notified by either the attorney or the director of his intentions to levy such assessment.

2. An order to show cause why a receiver, conservator, rehabilitator or liquidator of the insurer should not be appointed is issued while his policy is in force or within one year after its termination.

 

#### Section 20-786. Limitation on liability

#### Section 20-787. Nonassessable policies

A. If a reciprocal insurer has a surplus of assets over all liabilities at least equal to the minimum capital stock generally required of a domestic stock insurer authorized to transact like kinds of insurance, upon application of the attorney and as approved by the subscribers' advisory committee the director shall issue his certificate authorizing the insurer to extinguish the contingent liability of subscribers under its policies then in force in this state, and to omit provisions imposing contingent liability in all policies delivered or issued for delivery in this state for so long as all such surplus remains unimpaired.

C. The director shall not authorize a domestic reciprocal insurer so to extinguish the contingent liability of any of its subscribers or in any of its policies to be issued, unless it qualifies to and does extinguish such liability of all its subscribers and in all such policies for all kinds of insurance transacted by it, but if required by the laws of another state in which the insurer is transacting insurance as an authorized insurer, the insurer may issue policies providing for the contingent liability of such of its subscribers as may acquire such policies in such state, and need not extinguish the contingent liability applicable to policies theretofore in force in such state.

 

#### Section 20-788. Distribution of savings

A reciprocal insurer may from time to time return to its subscribers any unused premiums, savings or credits accruing to their accounts. Any such distribution shall not unfairly discriminate between classes of risks, or policies, or between subscribers, but this shall not prevent retrospective rating, nor distribution on a retrospective plan.

 

#### Section 20-789. Subscriber's share in assets

Upon the liquidation of a domestic reciprocal insurer, its assets remaining after discharge of its indebtedness and policy obligations, the return of any contributions of the attorney or other persons to its surplus made as provided in section 20-778, and the return of any unused premium, savings or credits then standing on subscribers' accounts, shall be distributed to its subscribers who were such within the twelve months prior to the last termination of its certificate of authority, according to such reasonable formula as the director may approve.

 

#### Section 20-790. Merger or conversion

A. A domestic reciprocal insurer upon affirmative vote of not less than two thirds of its subscribers who vote on such merger pursuant to due notice and the approval of the director of the terms therefor, may merge with another reciprocal insurer or be converted to a stock or mutual insurer.

B. Such a stock or mutual insurer shall be subject to the same capital requirements and shall have the same rights as a like domestic insurer transacting like kinds of insurance.

C. The director shall not approve any plan for merger or conversion which is inequitable to subscribers, or which, if for conversion to a stock insurer, does not give each subscriber preferential right to acquire stock of the proposed insurer proportionate to his interest in the reciprocal insurer as determined in accordance with section 20-789 and a reasonable length of time within which to exercise such right.

#### Section 20-791. Impaired reciprocal insurers

A. If the assets of a reciprocal insurer are at any time insufficient to discharge its liabilities, other than any liability on account of funds contributed by the attorney or others, and to maintain the required surplus, its attorney shall forthwith make up the deficiency or levy an assessment upon the subscribers for the amount needed to make up the deficiency, but subject to the limitation set forth in the power of attorney or policy.

B. If the attorney fails to make up the deficiency or to make the assessment within thirty days after the director orders him to do so, or if the deficiency is not fully made up within sixty days after the date the assessment was made, the insurer shall be deemed insolvent and shall be proceeded against as authorized by this title.

C. If liquidation of such an insurer is ordered, an assessment shall be levied upon the subscribers for such an amount, subject to limits as provided by this article, as the director determines to be necessary to discharge all liabilities of the insurer, exclusive of any funds contributed by the attorney or other persons, but including the reasonable cost of the liquidation.

#### Section 20-792. Ownership of real property

Legal title of real property acquired as an eligible investment in accordance with section 20-556 must be held in the name of the reciprocal insurer.

The supreme governing body or board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of persons who were not parties to the action, suit or proceeding or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine if the person acted in good faith. The termination of an action, suit or proceeding or a plea of no contest does not create a conclusive presumption that the person failed to act in good faith. The right of indemnification and reimbursement does not abrogate any other right to which the person is entitled as a matter of law and inures to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of the person.

C. A society may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of a person who is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the society or who is or was serving at the request of the society as a director, officer, employee or agent of any other firm, corporation or organization against any liability that is asserted against the person and that the person incurred in his capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent.

(c) The names and residences of the incorporators and the names, residences and official titles of all of the officers, trustees, directors or other persons who are to have and exercise the general control and the management of the affairs and funds of the society for the first year or until the ensuing election at which all of the officers shall be elected by the supreme governing body and that shall be held not later than one year from the date of issuance of the permanent certificate of authority.

2. The applicants shall file with the director the articles of incorporation, duly certified copies of the constitution and laws and rules, copies of all proposed forms of certificates, applications and circulars to be issued by the society and a bond conditioned on the return to the applicants of the advance payments if the organization is not completed within one year.

All of the documents that are filed with the director shall be in English. If the purposes of the society conform to the requirements of this article and if all applicable provisions of law have been complied with, the director shall certify, retain and file the articles of incorporation and shall furnish to the incorporators a preliminary certificate of authority authorizing the society to solicit members pursuant to this section.

3. A preliminary certificate of authority is not valid after one year from its date of issuance or after a further period of time of not more than one year that is authorized by the director for good cause unless the five hundred applicants as required by this section have been secured and the organization has been completed pursuant to this article. The articles of incorporation and all proceedings authorized by the articles of incorporation become null and void one year from the date of the preliminary certificate or at the expiration of the extended period, unless the society has completed its organization and received a final certificate of authority to do business pursuant to this section.

4. On receipt of the preliminary certificate of authority from the director, the society may solicit members for the purpose of completing its organization, shall collect from each applicant the amount of not less than one regular monthly premium in accordance with its table of rates and shall issue to each applicant a receipt for the amount collected. A society shall not incur liability other than for the return of the advance payment, issue any certificate or pay, allow or offer or promise to pay or allow any death or disability benefit to any person until:

(a) Actual bona fide applications for benefits have been secured on not less than five hundred applicants and any necessary evidence of insurability has been furnished to and approved by the society.

(b) At least ten subordinate lodges have been established into which the five hundred applicants have been admitted.

(c) The treasurer or other corresponding officer of the society submits to the director a sworn statement showing that at least five hundred applicants have each paid in cash at least one regular monthly payment pursuant to this section and that the payments in the aggregate amount to at least one hundred fifty thousand dollars. The advance premiums shall be held in trust during the period of organization. If the society does not qualify for a certificate of authority within one year, the premiums shall be returned to the applicants.

5. The director may make any examination and require further information as the director deems advisable. After the society presents satisfactory evidence that it has complied with any applicable provisions of law, the director shall issue a certificate of authority to that effect. The certificate of authority is prima facie evidence of the existence of the society at the date of the certificate. The director shall record the certificate of authority. A certified copy of the record may be given in evidence.

6. An incorporated society that is authorized to transact business in this state, on or before January 1, 1995 is not required to reincorporate.

#### Section 20-870. Amendment to society laws

#### Section 20-872. Reinsurance

A. Pursuant to a reinsurance agreement, a domestic fraternal benefit society may cede any part or all of its risks to an insurer other than another fraternal benefit society that has the power to take the reinsurance and that is authorized to transact business in this state, or if the reinsurer is not authorized to transact business in this state, that is approved by the director. A society may not reinsure substantially all of its insurance in force without the written permission of the director. A society may take credit for the reserves on the ceded risks to the extent that the risks are reinsured. Any credit taken by a ceding society is not allowed as an admitted asset or as a deduction from liability for reinsurance that is made, ceded, renewed or otherwise effective after January 1, 1995, unless the reinsurance is payable by the assuming insurer on the basis of the liability of the ceding society under the contract or contracts reinsured without diminution because of the insolvency of the ceding society.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a society may reinsure the risks of another society in a consolidation or merger that is approved by the director pursuant to section 20-873.

 

#### Section 20-873. Consolidation or merger

A. A domestic fraternal benefit society may consolidate or merge with any other society if it complies with this section. The society shall file the following with the director:

1. A certified copy of the written contract that contains in full the terms and conditions of the consolidation or merger.

2. A sworn statement by the president and secretary or other corresponding officers of each society that shows the financial condition of each society on a date designated by the director. The date shall not be earlier than December 31 next preceding the date of the contract.

3. A verified certificate of the president and secretary or other corresponding officers of each society stating that the consolidation or merger has been approved by a two-thirds vote of the supreme governing body of each society and that the vote was conducted at a regular or special meeting of each society, or if allowed by the laws of the society, by mail.

4. Evidence that at least sixty days before the action of the supreme governing body of each society the text of the contract was furnished to all members of each society either by mail or publication in full in the official publication of each society.Â  The affidavit of any officer of the society or of any person who is authorized by the society to mail any notice or document stating that the notice or document was addressed and mailed is prima facie evidence that the notice or document was furnished to the addressees.

B. The director shall approve the consolidation or merger and shall issue a certificate of approval if the director finds that the contract conforms with the requirements of this section, that the financial statements are correct and that the consolidation or merger is just and equitable to the members of each society. On the director's approval, the contract is in full force and effect, except that if one of the parties to the contract is incorporated under the laws of any other state or territory, the consolidation or merger does not become effective until the consolidation or merger is approved pursuant to the laws of that state or territory and a certificate of approval is filed with the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions in this state. If the laws of the other state or territory do not provide for consolidation or merger, the consolidation or merger does not become effective until it has been approved by and a certificate of approval is filed with the insurance director in that state or territory.

C. After the consolidation or merger becomes effective, all of the rights, franchises and interests of the consolidated or merged societies in and to real, personal and mixed property are vested in the society resulting from or remaining after the consolidation or merger. No other instrument is necessary to convey any property interests, except that conveyances of real property shall be evidenced by proper deeds. The title to any real estate or any interest in real estate that is vested under the laws of this state in any of the societies that are consolidated or merged does not revert or is not impaired in any way by reason of the merger or consolidation but vests absolutely in the society that results from or remains after the consolidation or merger.

The affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the supreme governing body at a regular or special meeting is required for approval of the plan. A plan of conversion is not effective unless it is approved by the director. The director may approve the plan of conversion if the director finds that the proposed change conforms to the law and is not prejudicial to the certificate holders of the society.

On the application of an adult member, a society may provide benefits on the lives of children who are under the minimum age for adult membership.

A society may limit the scope of beneficiary designations and shall provide that no revocable beneficiary has or may obtain any vested interest in the proceeds of a certificate until the certificate becomes due and payable in conformity with the provisions of the benefit contract.

B. A society may provide for the payment of funeral benefits to the extent of that portion of any payment under a certificate that reasonably appears to be due to any person who is equitably entitled to the payment and who incurred expenses resulting from the burial of a member. Any amount paid pursuant to this section shall not exceed one thousand dollars.

C. If a lawful beneficiary to whom death benefits are payable does not exist at the death of a person insured under a benefit contract, the benefit shall be paid to the estate of the deceased insured, except to the extent that funeral benefits have been paid pursuant to subsection B. If the owner of the certificate is a person other than the insured, the benefits shall be paid to the certificate owner.

#### Section 20-877. Benefits not attachable

Any money or other benefit, charity, relief or aid that a society pays, provides or renders is not subject to attachment, garnishment or other process and shall not be seized, taken, appropriated or applied to pay any debt or liability of any member, beneficiary or other person who may have a right under a benefit contract, either before or after the society pays the benefit.

#### Section 20-878. Benefit contract

A. A society shall issue to each owner of a benefit contract a certificate that specifies the amount of benefits provided under the certificate. The certificate shall state that it constitutes the benefit contract as of the date of issuance of the certificate, together with any riders or endorsements attached to the certificate, the laws of the society, the application for membership, the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, signed by the applicant and all amendments to any of these. A copy of the application for insurance and declaration of insurability, if any, shall be endorsed on or attached to the certificate. All statements on the application are representations and not warranties. Any waiver of this provision is void.

B. Any amendments to the laws of the society that are made or enacted after the certificate is issued are binding on the owner and beneficiaries and govern and control the benefit contract in all respects as if the amendments were made and in force before the time of the application for insurance. An amendment does not destroy or diminish any benefits that the society contracted to give the owner as of the date of issuance.

C. A person on whose life a benefit contract is issued before the person attains the age of majority is bound by the terms of the application.

D. The laws of the society shall provide that if the society's reserves as to any or all classes of certificates become impaired, the board of directors or other corresponding body may require that the owner pay to the society the amount of the owner's equitable proportion of the deficiency as ascertained by the board or other corresponding body. If the payment is not made the payment stands as an indebtedness against the certificate and draws interest in an amount not exceeding the rate specified for certificate loans under the certificate or the owner may accept a proportionate reduction in benefits under the certificate, or both. The society may specify the manner of the election and which alternative is presumed if no election is made.

E. Copies of any documents under this section that are certified by the secretary or other corresponding officer of the society shall be received in evidence on the terms and conditions of those documents.

F. A certificate shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless a copy of the form is filed with and approved by the director in the manner provided for like policies issued by life and disability insurers in this state. Every life, accident and sickness, health or disability insurance certificate and every annuity certificate that is issued on or after January 1, 1996 shall be filed with and approved by the director and shall meet the standard contract provision requirements that are not inconsistent with this title for like policies issued by life and disability insurers in this state. A society may provide a grace period for the payment of premiums of one full month in its certificates. The certificate shall state the amount of premiums that are payable under the certificate and shall recite or prescribe the substance of any of the society's laws or rules in effect at the time of issuance of the certificate that, if violated, will result in the termination of or reduction of benefits payable under the certificate. If the laws or rules of the society provide for the expulsion or suspension of a member, the certificate shall state that a member who is expelled or suspended may maintain the certificate in force by continuing to pay the required premium, unless the member was expelled or suspended for the nonpayment of premium or during the contestable period for material misrepresentation in the application for membership or insurance.

G. Benefit contracts that are issued on the lives of persons who are under the society's minimum age for adult membership may provide for the transfer of control of ownership to the insured at an age specified in the certificate. The society may require that an application for membership be approved in order to effect this transfer and may provide for the regulation, government and control of the certificates and all rights, obligations and liabilities incident to and connected with the certificate. The certificate shall specify ownership rights before the transfer.

H. A society may specify the terms and conditions on which benefit contracts may be assigned.

#### Section 20-881. Funds

C. In any life or disability insurance policy issued upon the life of a spouse, the designation made by such spouse of a beneficiary in accordance with the terms of the policy shall create a presumption that the beneficiary was so designated with the consent of the other spouse, but only as to any beneficiary who is the child, grandchild, parent, brother or sister of either of the spouses. The insurer may in good faith rely upon the representations made by the insured as to the relationship to him of any such beneficiary.

B. Subject to the statute of limitations, the amount of any premiums for insurance paid in fraud of creditors, with interest, shall inure to their benefit from the proceeds of the policy, but the insurer issuing the policy shall be discharged of all liability on the policy by payment of the proceeds in accordance with its terms, unless before payment the insurer received written notice by or in behalf of some creditor, with specification of the amount claimed, claiming to recover for certain premiums paid in fraud of creditors.

C. For the purposes of subsection A, a policy shall also be deemed to be payable to a person other than the insured if and to the extent that a facility-of-payment clause or similar clause in the policy permits the insurer to discharge its obligation after the death of the individual insured by paying the death benefits to a person as permitted by the clause.

D. If, for a continuous, unexpired period of two years, a policy of life insurance has named as beneficiary the insured's surviving spouse, child, parent, brother, sister or any other dependent family member, then, in event of bankruptcy or in any proceeding before any court in this state, the cash surrender value of the insurance, in the proportion that the policy names any such beneficiary, shall be exempt from claims and demands of all creditors, other than a creditor to whom the policy has been pledged or assigned, and except that, subject to the statute of limitations, the amount of any premiums which are recoverable or avoidable by a creditor pursuant to title 44, chapter 8, article 1, with interest, shall inure to their benefit from the cash surrender value.Â  For the purposes of this subsection, "dependent" means a family member who is dependent on the insured for not less than half support.

A. A policy of group life insurance or the proceeds thereof payable to the individual insured or to the beneficiary thereunder shall not be liable, either before or after payment, to be applied by any legal or equitable process to pay any liability of any person having a right under the policy. The proceeds thereof, when not made payable to a named beneficiary or to a third person pursuant to a facility-of-payment clause, shall not constitute a part of the estate of the individual insured for the payment of his debts.

B. This section shall not apply to group life insurance issued pursuant to article 2 of chapter 6 of this title to a creditor covering his debtors, to the extent that such proceeds are applied to payment of the obligation for the purpose of which the insurance was so issued.

The director shall adopt rules necessary to comply with the requirements of the social security disability amendments of 1980 (P.L. 96-265; 42 United States Code section 1395ss) and any federal laws or regulations pertaining to that section, so that this state may retain its full authority to regulate minimum standards for medicare supplement insurance.

B. For the purposes of this section, an insurer may file for medicare supplement rates that include an early enrollment discount that will not be considered an attained age rating structure.

Insurers shall disclose to all applicants how the early enrollment discount will diminish over time.

C. Subject to the other limitations provided in this subsection, a benefit mandated in this title for health insurance policies does not apply to medicare supplement insurance policies unless the mandated policy benefit is set forth in rules adopted pursuant to this section or unless the statute mandating the policy benefit expressly states that it is made specifically applicable to medicare supplement insurance policies. A medicare supplement insurance policy may not contain any exclusion for services provided by any type of properly licensed health care provider if the provider's services are eligible for medicare reimbursement and if the specific services in question would be covered by medicare. The scope of benefits of a medicare supplement policy may not be less than the minimum level of benefits established by federal law.

The director shall adopt rules relating to coordination of benefits provisions in group disability insurance policies. This section shall apply to hospital and medical service corporations and health care services organizations.

 

#### Section 20-1135. Prohibition against excluding coverage because of previous tests for a condition

An insurance contract offered by an insurer pursuant to this chapter shall not exclude coverage of a condition if the insured person has previously had tests for the condition and the condition was not found to exist. There must be evidence that a condition actually existed before the insurance contract was entered into in order to exclude coverage of the condition.

#### Section 20-1136. Accelerated payments of certain benefits in life insurance policies

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any policy of life insurance may provide, in accordance with the provisions of subsection B, for the acceleration of death benefits in advance of the time such benefits would otherwise be payable upon the occurrence of a terminal illness, a catastrophic illness, or eligibility for long-term care.

B. The director may adopt rules regarding advertising, disclosure, benefit levels, benefit eligibility, nonforfeiture, and reserves for the accelerated payment of death benefits set forth under subsection A.

#### Section 20-1137. Limited benefit coverage; prohibited practice; definition

A. Bundling or combining various limited benefit insurance policies and advertising or indicating in any manner that these policies are major medical expense coverage policies or could be substituted for major medical expense coverage is a prohibited practice pursuant to chapter 2, article 6 of this title.

B. For the purposes of this title, "limited benefit coverage" means an insurance policy that is designed, advertised and marketed to supplement major medical insurance and that includes accident only, dental only, vision only, disability income only, fixed or hospital indemnity, specified disease insurance, credit insurance or Taft-Hartley trusts.

#### Section 20-1202. Standard provisions required in life insurance policies

A. No policy of life insurance other than industrial, group and pure endowments with or without return of premiums or of premiums and interest, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance all of the provisions required by sections 20-1203 to 20-1216, inclusive. This section shall not apply to annuity contracts nor to any provision of a life insurance policy relating to disability benefits or to additional benefits in the event of death by accident or accidental means.

#### Section 20-1203. Grace period

There shall be a provision that a grace period of thirty days, or, at the option of the insurer, of one month of not less than thirty days, shall be allowed within which the payment of any premium after the first may be made, during which period of grace the policy shall continue in full force. If a claim arises under the policy during the period of grace before the overdue premium is paid, the amount of the premium may be deducted from the policy proceeds.

#### Section 20-1204. Incontestability

There shall be a provision that the policy, exclusive of provisions relating to disability benefits or to additional benefits in the event of death by accident or accidental means, shall be incontestable, except for nonpayment of premiums, after it has been in force during the lifetime of the insured for a period of two years from its date of issue.

#### Section 20-1205. Application and policy as entire contract; statements in application as representations; information

A. There shall be a provision that the policy, or the policy and the application therefor if a copy of the application is endorsed upon or attached to the policy when issued, shall constitute the entire contract between the parties, and that all statements contained in the application shall, in the absence of fraud, be deemed representations and not warranties.

B. On written request of an applicant or annuity holder, an insurer shall provide within a reasonable time reasonable factual information regarding the benefits and provisions of his annuity contract.

#### Section 20-1207. Dividends

There shall be a provision in participating policies that, beginning not later than the end of the third policy year, the insurer shall annually ascertain and apportion the divisible surplus, if any, that will accrue on the policy anniversary or other dividend date specified in the policy provided the policy is in force and all premiums to that date are paid. Except as provided in this section, any dividend so apportioned shall, at the option of the party entitled to elect such option, be either payable in cash or applied to any one of such other dividend options as may be provided by the policy.

If the policy specifies a period within which the other dividend option may be elected, such period shall be not less than thirty days following the date on which the dividend is due and payable. The annually apportioned dividend shall be deemed to be payable in cash even though the policy provides that payment of the dividend is to be deferred for a specified period, but such period shall not exceed six years from the date of apportionment and interest shall be added to the dividend at a specified rate. If a participating policy provides that the benefit under any paid-up nonforfeiture provision is to be participating, it may provide that any divisible surplus apportioned while the insurance is in force under the nonforfeiture provision shall be applied in the manner set forth in the policy.

#### Section 20-1208. Policy loan on old policies

An insurer may, in lieu of the provisions permitted by this section for the deduction from a loan on the policy of an amount not more than two and one-half per cent of the amount insured by the policy and of any dividend additions thereto, insert in the policy a provision that one fifth of the entire reserve may be deducted in case of a loan under the policy, or may provide therein that the deduction may be the two and one-half per cent or the one fifth of the entire reserve at the option of the insurer. The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for six months after application therefor is made.

The loan value of the policy shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value at the end of the then current policy year, provided that the insurer may deduct, either from the loan value or from the proceeds of the loan, any existing indebtedness not already deducted in determining the cash surrender value including any interest then accrued but not due, any unpaid balance of the premium for the current policy year and interest on the loan to the end of the current policy year. The policy may also provide that if interest on any indebtedness is not paid when due it shall then be added to the existing indebtedness and shall bear interest at the same rate, and that if and when the total indebtedness on the policy, including interest due or accrued, equals or exceeds the amount of the loan value the policy shall terminate and become void. The policy shall reserve to the insurer the right to defer the granting of a loan, other than for the payment of any premium to the insurer, for six months after application. The policy, at the insurer's option, may provide for an automatic premium loan, subject to an election of the party entitled to elect.

E. The life insurer shall:

1. Notify the policyholder at the time a cash loan is made of the initial rate of interest on the loan.

2. Notify the policyholder with respect to premium loans of the initial rate of interest on the loan as soon as it is reasonably practical to do so after making the initial loan.

A. This section may be cited as the standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance.

B. Nonforfeiture provisions--Life. In the case of policies issued on or after the operative date of this section as defined in subsection J of this section, no policy of life insurance, except as set forth in subsection I of this section, shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless it contains in substance the following provisions, or corresponding provisions which in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the defaulting or surrendering policyholder as are the minimum requirements specified in this section and are essentially in compliance with subsection H of this section:

1. That in the event of default in any premium payment, the insurer will grant, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, a paid-up nonforfeiture benefit on a plan stipulated in the policy, effective as of such due date, of such amount as is specified by this section.Â  Instead of the stipulated paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, the insurer may substitute, upon proper request not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default, an actuarially equivalent alternative paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which provides a greater amount or longer period of death benefits or, if applicable, a greater amount or earlier payment of endowment benefits.

2. That upon surrender of the policy within sixty days after the due date of any premium payment in default after premiums have been paid for at least three full years in the case of ordinary insurance, and five full years in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, in lieu of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, a cash surrender value of such amount as is specified by this section.

3. That a specified paid-up nonforfeiture benefit shall become effective as specified in the policy unless the person entitled to make such election elects another available option not later than sixty days after the due date of the premium in default.

4. That if the policy has become paid up by completion of all premiums payments, or if it is continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit which became effective on or after the third policy anniversary in the case of ordinary insurance, or the fifth policy anniversary in the case of industrial insurance, the insurer will pay, upon surrender of the policy within thirty days after any policy anniversary, a cash surrender value of such amount as is specified by this section.

5. In the case of policies which cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or which provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, a statement of the mortality table, interest rate and method used in calculating cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy. In the case of all other policies, a statement of the mortality table and interest rate used in calculating the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy, together with a table showing the cash surrender value, if any, and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, if any, available under the policy on each policy anniversary, either during the first twenty policy years or during the term of the policy, whichever is shorter, such values and benefits to be calculated upon the assumption that there are no dividends or paid-up additions credited to the policy and that there is no indebtedness to the insurer on the policy.

6. A statement that the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits available under the policy are not less than the minimum values and benefits required by or pursuant to the insurance law of this state, an explanation of the manner in which the cash surrender values and the paid-up nonforfeiture benefits are altered by the existence of any paid-up additions credited to the policy or any indebtedness to the insurer on the policy, if a detailed statement of the method of computation of the values and benefits shown in the policy is not stated therein, a statement that such method of computation has been filed with the insurance supervisory official of the state in which the policy is delivered, and a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender value and paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy on any policy anniversary beyond the last anniversary for which such values and benefits are consecutively shown in the policy.

C. Any of the provisions or portions of the provisions set forth in subsection B, paragraphs 1 through 6 of this section which are not applicable by reason of the plan of insurance may, to the extent inapplicable, be omitted from the policy. The insurer shall reserve the right to defer the payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the policy.

D. Cash surrender value--Life.

1. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in the premium payment due on any policy anniversary, whether or not required by subsection B of this section, shall be an amount not less than the excess, if any, of the present value on such anniversary of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions if there had been no default, over the sum of the then present value of the adjusted premiums as defined in subsection F of this section and in section 20-1231.01, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary, and the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.

2. For any policy issued on or after the operative date as provided in section 20-1231.01 which provides supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits at the option of the insured and for an identifiable additional premium by rider or supplemental policy provision, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph 1 of this subsection is in an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such rider or supplemental policy provision and the cash surrender value as defined in such paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by such rider or supplemental policy provision.

3. For any family policy issued on or after the operative date as provided in section 20-1231.01 which defines a primary insured and provides term insurance on the life of the spouse of the primary insured expiring before the spouse's age seventy-one, the cash surrender value referred to in paragraph 1 of this subsection is in an amount not less than the sum of the cash surrender value as defined in that paragraph for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without term insurance on the life of the spouse and the cash surrender value as defined in that paragraph for a policy which provides only the benefits otherwise provided by term insurance on the life of the spouse.

4. Any cash surrender value available within thirty days after any policy anniversary under any policy paid up by completion of all premium payments, or any policy continued under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, whether or not required by subsection B of this section, shall be an amount not less than the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy, including any existing paid-up additions, decreased by any indebtedness to the insurer on account of or secured by the policy.

E. Paid-up nonforfeiture benefits--Life. Any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in the premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be such that its present value as of such anniversary shall be at least equal to the cash surrender value then provided for by the policy, or, if none is provided for, that cash surrender value which would have been required by this section in the absence of the conditions that premiums shall have been paid for at least a specified period.

F. The adjusted premiums--Life.

1. Paragraphs 1 through 4 and paragraph 5, subdivision (a) of this subsection do not apply to policies issued on or after the operative date as provided in section 20-1231.01. Except as provided in paragraph 3 of this subsection, the adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding extra premiums on a substandard policy, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all such adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:

(a) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.

(b) Two per cent of the amount of the insurance if the insurance is uniform in amount, or of the equivalent uniform amount, as defined by this section, if the amount of insurance varies with the duration of the policy.

(c) Forty per cent of the adjusted premium for the first policy year.

(d) Twenty-five per cent of either the adjusted premium for the first policy year or the adjusted premium for a whole life policy of the same uniform or equivalent uniform amount with uniform premiums for the whole of life issued at the same age for the same amount of insurance, whichever is less.

2. In applying the percentages specified in subdivisions (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 of this subsection, no adjusted premiums shall be deemed to exceed four per cent of the amount of insurance or uniform amount equivalent thereto.Â  When the plan or term of a policy has been changed, either by request of the insured or automatically in accordance with the provisions of the policy, the date of inception of the changed policy for the purposes of determining a nonforfeiture benefit or cash surrender value shall be the date as of which the age of the insured is determined for the purposes of the changed policy.

3. The adjusted premiums for any policy providing term insurance benefits by rider or supplemental policy provisions shall be equal to the sum of:

(a) The adjusted premiums for an otherwise similar policy issued at the same age without such term insurance benefits.

(b) The adjusted premiums for such term insurance benefits during the period for which premiums for such term insurance benefits are payable.Â  Such subdivisions (a) and (b) shall be calculated separately and as specified in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection except that, for the purposes of subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) of paragraph 1 of this subsection, the amount of insurance or equivalent uniform amount of insurance used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums referred to in this subdivision shall be equal to the excess of the corresponding amount determined for the entire policy over the amount used in the calculation of the adjusted premiums in subdivision (a) of this paragraph.

4. In the case of a policy providing an amount of insurance varying with the duration of the policy, the equivalent uniform amount thereof for the purpose of paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this subsection shall be deemed to be the uniform amount of insurance provided by an otherwise similar policy, containing the same endowment benefit or benefits, if any, issued at the same age and for the same term, the amount of which does not vary with duration and the benefits under which have the same present value at the date of issue as the benefits under the policy, but in the case of a policy for a varying amount of insurance issued on the life of a child under age ten, the equivalent uniform amount may be computed as though the amount of insurance provided by the policy prior to the attainment of age ten were the amount provided by the policy at age ten.

5. Tables for calculating adjusted premiums shall be as follows:

(a) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (b) and (d) of this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall for all policies of ordinary insurance be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1941 standard ordinary mortality table provided that, for any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not in excess of three years younger than the actual age of the insured. Such calculations for all policies of industrial insurance shall be made on the basis of the 1941 standard industrial mortality table. All calculations shall be made on the basis of the rate of interest, not exceeding three and one-half per cent per annum, specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, but in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than one hundred thirty per cent of the rates of mortality according to such applicable table. For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.

(b) This subdivision does not apply to ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date as provided in section 20-1231.01. In the case of ordinary policies issued on or after the operative date defined in subdivision (c) of this paragraph, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1958 standard ordinary mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half per cent per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding four per cent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1974 and prior to January 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after January 1, 1979, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent per annum may be used, and provided that:

(i) For any category of ordinary insurance issued on female risks, adjusted premiums and present values may be calculated according to an age not in excess of six years younger than the actual age of the insured.

(ii) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not in excess of those shown in the commissioners 1958 extended term insurance table.

(iii) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.

(c) Any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of subdivision (b) of this paragraph, either as to designated ordinary policies or as to all ordinary policies issued by it, after a specified date before January 1, 1966. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date of such subdivision (b) as to such policies for such insurer, such subdivision (b) shall become operative with respect to such policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, or so elects to have such subdivision (b) apply as to certain of its ordinary policies only, the operative date thereof as to all of the ordinary policies issued by such insurer, other than those policies as to which the insurer has elected an earlier operative date, shall be January 1, 1966.

(d) This subdivision does not apply to industrial policies issued on or after the operative date provided in section 20-1231.01. In the case of industrial policies issued on or after the operative date of this subdivision as defined herein, all adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subdivision shall be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table and the rate of interest specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided that such rate of interest shall not exceed three and one-half per cent per annum except that a rate of interest not exceeding four per cent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after July 1, 1974 and prior to January 1, 1979, and a rate of interest not exceeding five and one-half per cent per annum may be used for policies issued on or after January 1, 1979, except that for any single premium whole life or endowment insurance policy a rate of interest not exceeding six and one-half per cent per annum may be used. But, in calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table and, for insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculations of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on such other table of mortality as may be specified by the insurer and approved by the director.Â  After the effective date of this subdivision, an insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this subdivision, either as to designated industrial policies or as to all industrial policies issued by it, after a specified date before January 1, 1968. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date of this subdivision for such insurer, this subdivision shall become operative with respect to the industrial policies thereafter issued by such insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this subdivision for such insurer shall be January 1, 1968.

(e) For any plan of life insurance which provides for future premium determination, the amounts of which are to be determined by the insurer based on then estimates of future experience, or for any plan of life insurance which is of such a nature that minimum values cannot be determined by the methods described in subsection B, C, D or E of this section, paragraph 1 of this subsection, subdivision (b), (c) or (d) of this paragraph or section 20-1231.01, then:

(i) The director must be satisfied that the benefits provided under the plan are substantially as favorable to policyholders and insureds as the minimum benefits otherwise required by subsection B, C, D or E of this section, paragraph 1 of this subsection, subdivision (b), (c) or (d) of this paragraph or section 20-1231.01.

(ii) The director must be satisfied that the benefits and the pattern of premiums of the plan are not such as to mislead prospective policyholders or insureds.

(iii) The cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits provided by the plan must not be less than the minimum values and benefits required for the plan computed by a method consistent with the principles of this standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance, as determined by rules adopted by the director.

G. Calculation of values--Life.

1. Any cash surrender value and any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due at any time other than on the policy anniversary shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of fractional premiums beyond the last preceding policy anniversary. All values referred to in subsections D, E and F of this section and section 20-1231.01 may be calculated upon the assumption that any death benefit is payable at the end of the policy year of death. The net value of any paid-up additions, other than paid-up term additions, shall be not less than the amounts used to provide such additions.

2. Notwithstanding such provisions of subsection D of this section, additional benefits payable and premiums for all such additional benefits shall be disregarded in ascertaining cash surrender values and nonforfeiture benefits required by this section, and no such additional benefits shall be required to be included in any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits:

(a) In the event of death or dismemberment by accident or accidental means.

(b) In the event of total and permanent disability.

(c) As reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits.

(d) As term insurance benefits provided by a rider or supplemental policy provision to which, if issued as a separate policy, this section would not apply.

(e) As term insurance on the life of a child or on the lives of children provided in a policy on the life of a parent of the child, if such term insurance expires before the child's age is twenty-six, is uniform in amount after the child's age is one, and has not become paid-up by reason of the death of a parent of the child.

(f) As other policy benefits additional to life insurance and endowment benefits.

H. This subsection, in addition to all other applicable subsections of this section, applies to all policies issued on or after January 1, 1986:

1. Any cash surrender value available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment due on any policy anniversary shall be in an amount which does not differ by more than two-tenths of one per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years, from the sum of:

(a) The greater of zero and the basic cash value hereinafter specified.

(b) The present value of any existing paid-up additions less the amount of any indebtedness to the insurer under the policy.

2. The basic cash value shall be equal to the present value, on such anniversary, of the future guaranteed benefits which would have been provided for by the policy, excluding any existing paid-up additions and before deduction of any indebtedness to the insurer, if there had been no default, less the then present value of the nonforfeiture factors, corresponding to premiums which would have fallen due on and after such anniversary, except that the effects on the basic cash value of supplemental life insurance or annuity benefits or of family coverage, as described in subsection D or F of this section, whichever is applicable, shall be the same as are the effects specified in subsection D or F of this section, whichever is applicable, on the cash surrender values defined in that subsection.

3. The nonforfeiture factor for each policy year shall be an amount equal to a percentage of the adjusted premium for the policy year, as defined in subsection F of this section or section 20-1231.01, whichever is applicable.Â  Except as is required by the next succeeding sentence of this paragraph, such percentage:

(a) Must be the same percentage for each policy year between the second policy anniversary and the latter of:

(i) The fifth policy anniversary.

(ii) The first policy anniversary at which there is available under the policy a cash surrender value in an amount, before including any paid-up additions and before deducting any indebtedness, of at least two-tenths of one per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years.

(b) Must be such that no percentage after the later of the two policy anniversaries specified in subdivision (a) may apply to fewer than five consecutive policy years.

4. No basic cash value may be less than the value which would be obtained if the adjusted premiums for the policy, as defined in subsection F of this section or section 20-1231.01, whichever is applicable, were substituted for the nonforfeiture factors in the calculation of the basic cash value.

5. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this subsection shall for a particular policy be calculated on the same mortality and interest bases as are used in demonstrating the policy's compliance with the other subsections of this section. The cash surrender values referred to in this subsection shall include any endowment benefits provided for by the policy.

6. Any cash surrender value available other than in the event of default in a premium payment due on a policy anniversary and the amount of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit available under the policy in the event of default in a premium payment shall be determined in manners consistent with the manners specified for determining the analogous minimum amounts in subsections B, C, D, E and G of this section and section 20-1231.01. The amounts of any cash surrender values and of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefits granted in connection with additional benefits such as those listed in subsection G, paragraph 2 of this section shall conform with the principles of this subsection.

I. Exceptions. This section and section 20-1231.01 do not apply to any of the following:

1. Reinsurance.

2. Group insurance.

3. Pure endowment.

4. Annuity or reversionary annuity contract.

5. A term policy of uniform amount which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, or renewal thereof, of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy.

6. A term policy of decreasing amount, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, on which each adjusted premium, calculated as specified in subsection F of this section and section 20-1231.01, is less than the adjusted premiums so calculated on a term policy of uniform amount, or renewal thereof, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, issued at the same age and for the same initial amount of insurance and for a term of twenty years or less expiring before age seventy-one, for which uniform premiums are payable during the entire term of the policy.

7. Any policy which is delivered outside this state through an insurance producer or other representative of the insurer issuing the policy.

8. A policy, which provides no guaranteed nonforfeiture or endowment benefits, for which no cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, at the beginning of any policy year, calculated as specified in subsections D, E and F of this section and section 20-1231.01, exceeds two and one-half per cent of the amount of insurance at the beginning of the same policy year. For the purposes of determining the applicability of this section, the age at expiry for a joint term life insurance policy is the age at expiry of the oldest life.

J. Operative date. Except as is otherwise provided in subsection F of this section, after January 1, 1955, any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before July 1, 1956. After the filing of such notice, then upon such specified date, which shall be the operative date for such insurer, this section shall become operative with respect to the policies thereafter issued by the insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this section for the insurer shall be July 1, 1956.

 

 

#### Section 20-1231.01. Standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance; table for calculating adjusted premiums; definitions

A. Except as provided in paragraph 7 of this section, on a policy issued on or after the operative date as provided in this section:

1. The adjusted premiums for any policy shall be calculated on an annual basis and shall be such a uniform percentage of the respective premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments or special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all adjusted premiums shall be equal to the sum of:

(a) The then present value of the future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.

(b) One per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years.

(c) One hundred twenty-five per cent of the nonforfeiture net level premium. In applying the percentage specified in subdivision (c) of this paragraph no nonforfeiture net level premium shall be deemed to exceed four per cent of either the amount of insurance, if the insurance is uniform in amount, or the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years. The date of issue of a policy for the purpose of this section is the date as of which the rated age of the insured is determined.

2. The nonforfeiture net level premium is equal to the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of the guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy divided by the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the date of issue of the policy and on each anniversary of the policy on which a premium falls due.

3. In the case of policies that cause on a basis guaranteed in the policy unscheduled changes in benefits or premiums, or that provide an option for changes in benefits or premiums other than a change to a new policy, the adjusted premiums and present values shall initially be calculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated at the date of issue of the policy. At the time of such a change in the benefits or premiums, the future adjusted premiums, nonforfeiture net level premiums and present values shall be recalculated on the assumption that future benefits and premiums do not change from those stipulated by the policy immediately after the change.

4. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 7 of this section, the recalculated future adjusted premiums for any such policy are the uniform percentage of the respective future premiums specified in the policy for each policy year, excluding amounts payable as extra premiums to cover impairments and special hazards and also excluding any uniform annual contract charge or policy fee specified in the policy in a statement of the method to be used in calculating the cash surrender values and paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, that the present value, at the time of change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, of all such future adjusted premiums shall be equal to the excess of the sum of the then present value of the then future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy and the additional expense allowance, if any, over the then cash surrender value, if any, or present value of any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit under the policy.

5. The additional expense allowance, at the time of the change to the newly defined benefits or premiums, is the sum of:

(a) One per cent of the excess, if positive, of the average amount of insurance at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the change over the average amount of insurance prior to the change at the beginning of each of the first ten policy years subsequent to the time of the most recent previous change or, if there has been no previous change, the date of issue of the policy.

(b) One hundred twenty-five per cent of the increase, if positive, in the nonforfeiture net level premium.

6. The recalculated nonforfeiture net level premium is equal to the result obtained by dividing (a) by (b) where:

(a) (a) equals the sum of:

(i) The nonforfeiture net level premium applicable prior to the change times the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of the change on which a premium would have fallen due had the change not occurred.

(ii) The present value of the increase in future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policy.

(b) (b) equals the present value of an annuity of one per annum payable on each anniversary of the policy on or subsequent to the date of change on which a premium falls due.

7. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, in the case of a policy issued on a substandard basis that provides reduced graded amounts of insurance so that, in each policy year, the policy has the same tabular mortality cost as an otherwise similar policy issued on the standard basis that provides higher uniform amounts of insurance, adjusted premiums and present values for the substandard policy may be calculated as if it were issued to provide higher uniform amounts of insurance on the standard basis.

8. All adjusted premiums and present values referred to in this section shall, for all policies of ordinary insurance, be calculated on the basis of either the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table, or at the election of the insurer for any one or more specified plans of life insurance, the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with ten year select mortality factors, for all policies of industrial insurance, be calculated on the basis of the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table, and for all policies issued in a particular calendar year, be calculated on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate for policies issued in that calendar year. However:

(a) At the option of the insurer, calculations for all policies issued in a particular calendar year may be made on the basis of a rate of interest not exceeding the nonforfeiture interest rate, as prescribed in this section, for policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year.

(b) Under any paid-up nonforfeiture benefit, including any paid-up dividend additions, any cash surrender value available, whether or not required by section 20-1231, subsection B, shall be calculated on the basis of the mortality table and rate of interest used in determining the amount of such paid-up nonforfeiture benefit and paid-up dividend additions, if any.

(c) An insurer may calculate the amount of any guaranteed paid-up nonforfeiture benefit including any paid-up additions under the policy on the basis of an interest rate no lower than that specified in the policy for calculating cash surrender values.

(d) In calculating the present value of any paid-up term insurance with accompanying pure endowment, if any, offered as a nonforfeiture benefit, the rates of mortality assumed may be not more than those shown in the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table for policies of ordinary insurance and not more than the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table for policies of industrial insurance.

(e) For insurance issued on a substandard basis, the calculation of any such adjusted premiums and present values may be based on appropriate modifications of the tables prescribed in this section and section 20-1231.

(f) For policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, any commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten year select mortality factors or for the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table.Â  For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners 1980 standard ordinary mortality table with or without ten-year select mortality factors or for the commissioners 1980 extended term insurance table. If the director approves by rule any commissioners standard ordinary mortality table adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.

(g) For policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, any industrial mortality tables, adopted after 1980 by the national association of insurance commissioners, that are approved by the director for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard may be substituted for the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table.Â  For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the valuation manual shall provide the commissioners standard mortality table for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard that may be substituted for the commissioners 1961 standard industrial mortality table or the commissioners 1961 industrial extended term insurance table.Â  If the director approves by rule any commissioners standard industrial mortality table adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual.

9. The nonforfeiture interest rate is as follows:

(a) For policies issued before the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be equal to one hundred twenty-five per cent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for such policy as defined in the standard valuation law, rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one per cent.

(b) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year shall be provided by the valuation manual.

10. Notwithstanding any other provision in this title, any refiling of nonforfeiture values or their methods of computation for any previously approved policy form that involves only a change in the interest rate or mortality table used to compute nonforfeiture values shall not require refiling of any other provisions of that policy form.

11. After July 24, 1982 any insurer may file with the director a written notice of its election to comply with the provisions of this section after a specified date before January 1, 1989, which is the operative date of this section for the insurer. If an insurer makes no such election, the operative date of this section for the insurer is January 1, 1989.

B. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Operative date of the valuation manual" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-510, subsection R, paragraph 2.

2. "Valuation manual" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-510, subsection B.

 

#### Section 20-1232. Standard nonforfeiture law for individual deferred annuities

A. A contract of annuity, except as stated in subsection K of this section, shall not be delivered or issued for delivery in this state unless the contract contains in substance the following provisions or corresponding provisions that in the opinion of the director are at least as favorable to the contract holder on cessation of payment of considerations under the contract:

1. That on cessation of payment of considerations under a contract, or on the written request of the contract owner, the company shall grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan stipulated in the contract of such value as is specified in subsections D, E, F, G and I of this section.

2. If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity, or at any other time, that on surrender of the contract at or before the commencement of any annuity payments, the company shall pay in lieu of a paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit of such an amount as is specified in subsections D, E, G and I of this section.Â  The company, within thirty days of the date of maturity as prescribed in the contract, shall notify the annuity owner of the ownerâs rights under the contract at the time of maturity of the contract, including the right to receive the cash value benefit in a lump sum, if applicable.Â  The company shall pay any amounts due under the contract within thirty days after the date the amount becomes payable.Â  The company may reserve the right to defer the payment of the cash surrender benefit for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty days after demand for such a cash surrender benefit with surrender of the contract after making written request and receiving written approval from the director.Â  The annuity owner shall be notified within fifteen days after the date that any request for withdrawal is received that the company has requested a deferral pursuant to this paragraph. In making its request to the director, the company shall address the necessity and equitability to all policyholders of the deferral and the reason why payment cannot take place within the time period required under this paragraph after the date the annuity benefit becomes due. Any transfer of monies to another annuity company designated by the contract owner pursuant to section 1035 of the internal revenue code shall take place within thirty days after all required forms relating to the transfer are filed with the original annuity company.

3. A statement of the mortality table, if any, and interest rates used in calculating any minimum paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that are guaranteed under the contract, together with sufficient information to determine the amounts of the benefits.

4. A statement that any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits that may be available under the contract are not less than the minimum benefits required by any statute of the state in which the contract is delivered and an explanation of the manner in which the benefits are altered by the existence of any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract, any indebtedness to the company on the contract or any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.

B. Notwithstanding the requirements of subsection A of this section, a deferred annuity contract may provide that if no considerations have been received under a contract for a period of two full years and the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit at maturity on the plan stipulated in the contract arising from prior considerations paid would be less than $20 monthly, the company, at its option, may terminate the contract by payment in cash of the then present value of the portion of the paid-up annuity benefit, calculated on the basis on the mortality table, if any, and interest rate specified in the contract for determining the paid-up annuity benefit, and by this payment shall be relieved of any further obligation under the contract.

C. The minimum values as specified in subsections D, E, F, G and I of this section of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based on minimum nonforfeiture amounts prescribed as follows:

1. The minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or before the commencement of any annuity payments is equal to an accumulation up to that time at rates of interest, as prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection, of the net considerations paid before that time, decreased by the sum of all of the following:

(a) Any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at rates of interest as prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

(b) An annual contract charge of $50, accumulated at rates of interest as prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

(c) Any premium tax paid by the company for the contract, accumulated at rates of interest as prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

(d) The amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount is an amount equal to eighty-seven and one-half percent of the gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year.

2. The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts is an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent per annum and the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset:

(a) The five-year constant maturity treasury rate reported by the federal reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest one-twentieth of one percent, specified in the contract not longer than fifteen months before the contract issue date or redetermination date under subdivision (d) of this paragraph.

(b) Reduced by one hundred twenty-five basis points.

(c) Where the resulting interest rate is not less than fifteen-hundredths of one percent.

(d) The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods.Â  The redetermination date, basis and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract.Â  The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five-year constant maturity treasury rate to be used at each redetermination date.

3. During the period or term that a contract provides substantive participation in an equity indexed benefit, it may increase the reduction described in paragraph 2, subdivision (b) of this subsection by up to an additional one hundred basis points to reflect the value of the equity index benefit.Â  The present value at the contract issue date, and at each redetermination date thereafter, of the additional reduction shall not exceed the market value of the benefit. The director may require a demonstration that the present value of the additional reduction does not exceed the market value of the benefit.Â  Lacking such a demonstration that is acceptable to the director, the director may disallow or limit the additional reduction.

4. The director may adopt rules to implement paragraph 3 of this subsection and to provide for further adjustments to the calculation of minimum nonforfeiture amounts for contracts that provide substantive participation in an equity index benefit and for other contracts where the director determines that adjustments are justified.

D. Any paid-up annuity benefit available under a contract shall be such that its present value on the date annuity payments are to commence is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on that date. The present value shall be computed using the mortality table, if any, and the interest rate specified in the contract for determining the minimum paid-up annuity benefits guaranteed in the contract.

E. For contracts that provide cash surrender benefits, the cash surrender benefits available before maturity shall not be less than the present value as of the date of surrender of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit that would be provided under the contract at maturity arising from considerations paid prior to the time of cash surrender reduced by the amount appropriate to reflect any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract, the present value being calculated on the basis of an interest rate not more than one percent higher than the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine maturity value, decreased by the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract. Any cash surrender benefit shall not be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time. The death benefit under such contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.

F. For contracts that do not provide cash surrender benefits, the present value of any paid-up annuity benefit available as a nonforfeiture option at any time before maturity shall not be less than the present value of that portion of the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit provided under the contract arising from considerations paid before the time the contract is surrendered in exchange for, or changed to, a deferred paid-up annuity, the present value being calculated for the period before the maturity date on the basis of the interest rate specified in the contract for accumulating the net considerations to determine maturity value and increased by any additional amounts credited by the company to the contract.Â  For contracts that do not provide any death benefits before the commencement of any annuity payments, the present values shall be calculated on the basis of such interest rate and the mortality table specified in the contract for determining the maturity value of the paid-up annuity benefit. However, the present value of a paid-up annuity benefit shall not be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount at that time.

G. For the purpose of determining the benefits calculated under subsections E and F of this section, in the case of annuity contracts under which an election may be made to have annuity payments commence at optional maturity dates, the maturity date shall be deemed to be the latest date for which election shall be allowed by the contract, but shall not be deemed to be later than the anniversary of the contract next following the annuitant's seventieth birthday or the tenth anniversary of the contract, whichever is later.

H. Any contract that does not provide cash surrender benefits or does not provide death benefits at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount before the commencement of any annuity payments shall include a statement in a prominent place in the contract that such benefits are not provided.

I. Any paid-up annuity, cash surrender or death benefits available at any time, other than on the contract anniversary under any contract with fixed scheduled considerations, shall be calculated with allowance for the lapse of time and the payment of any scheduled considerations beyond the beginning of the contract year in which cessation of payment of considerations under the contract occurs.

J. For a contract that provides, within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision, both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections D, E, F, G and I of this section, additional benefits payable in the event of total and permanent disability, as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits or as other policy benefits additional to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and considerations for all such additional benefits, shall be disregarded in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section. The inclusion of such additional benefits shall not be required in any paid-up benefits, unless the additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts, paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.

K. This section shall not apply to any reinsurance, group annuity purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the internal revenue code, as now or hereafter amended, premium deposit fund, variable annuity, investment annuity, immediate annuity, any deferred annuity contract after annuity payments have commenced, or reversionary annuity, nor to any contract that shall be delivered outside this state through an insurance producer or other representative of the company issuing the contract.

L. The director may adopt rules to implement this section.

#### Section 20-1233. Free look; annuity contracts

A. Each annuity contract delivered or issued for delivery in this state and each annuity application shall contain a notice prominently printed on or attached to the first page stating that, on written request, an insurer is required to provide within a reasonable time reasonable factual information regarding the benefits and provisions of the annuity contract to the contract holder and that if for any reason the contract holder is not satisfied with the annuity contract the contract holder may return the annuity contract within ten days, or within thirty days if the contract holder is sixty-five years of age or older on the date of the application for the annuity contract, after the contract is delivered and receive a refund of all monies paid.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A, for variable annuity contracts, the refund under subsection A shall equal the sum of the difference between the premiums paid, including any policy or contract fees or other charges, and the amounts allocated to any separate accounts under the policy or contract, and the value of the amounts allocated to any separate accounts under the policy or contract on the date the returned policy is received by the insurer or its insurance producer.

C. The ten or thirty day return and refund provision provided in subsection A does not apply to an annuity contract supplemental to a settled annuity contract that provides for payments in consideration of accumulations from the original annuity contract and that is issued only to holders of the original contract.

B. A policy or contract owner may replace existing life insurance or annuities after indicating in or as part of an application for new coverage that replacement is not intended.Â  A pattern of such action by a policy or contract owner who buys new coverage from the same producer is deemed prima facie evidence of the insurance producer's knowledge that replacement was intended in connection with the transaction and of the insurance producer's intent to violate this article.

C. If the requirements of this article have not been met, the replacing insurer shall provide the policy owner an in-force illustration, if available, a policy summary for the replacement policy or the available disclosure document for the replacement contract and the appropriate notice regarding replacements prescribed in section 20-1241.03.

#### Section 20-1243.03. Duties of insurers and producers; definitions

A.

B. To satisfy the care obligation, in making a recommendation, the producer shall exercise reasonable diligence, care and skill to do all of the following:

1. Know the consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives.

2. Understand the available recommendation options after making a reasonable inquiry into options available to the producer.

3. Have a reasonable basis to believe both of the following:

(a) The recommended option effectively addresses the consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives over the life of the product, as evaluated in light of the consumer profile information.

(b) The consumer would benefit from certain features of the annuity, such as annuitization, death or living benefits or other insurance-related features.

4. Communicate the basis or bases of the recommendation.

5. Make reasonable efforts to obtain consumer profile information from the consumer before the recommendation of an annuity.

6. Consider the types of products the producer is authorized and licensed to recommend or sell that address the consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives.Â  The producer:

(a) Is not required to analyze or consider any product outside the producer's authority and license or other possible alternative products or strategies that are available in the market at the time of recommendation.

(b) Shall be held to standards that apply to producers with similar authority and licensure.

7. In the case of an exchange or replacement of an annuity, consider the whole transaction, including taking into consideration whether:

(a) The consumer will incur a surrender charge, be subject to the commencement of a new surrender period, lose existing benefits, such as death, living or other contractual benefits, or be subject to increased fees, investment advisory fees or charges for riders and similar product enhancements.

(b) The replacing product would substantially benefit the consumer in comparison to the replaced product over the life of the product.

(c) The consumer has had another annuity exchange or replacement and, in particular, an exchange or replacement within the preceding sixty months.

C. The requirements under the best interest and care obligations under subsections A and B of this section do not create a fiduciary obligation or relationship and only create a regulatory obligation as established in this article.

D. The requirements under the care obligation under subsection B of this section:

1. Apply to the particular annuity as a whole and the underlying subaccounts to which funds are allocated at the time of purchase or exchange of an annuity, and riders and similar product enhancements, if any.

2. Do not mean the annuity with the lowest onetime or multiple occurrence compensation structure shall necessarily be recommended.

3. Do not mean the producer has ongoing monitoring obligations under the care obligation under subsection B of this section, although such an obligation may be separately owed under the terms of a fiduciary, consulting, investment advising or financial planning agreement between the consumer and the producer.

4. Do not require a producer to obtain any license other than a producer license with the appropriate line of authority to sell, solicit or negotiate insurance in this state, including any securities license, in order to fulfill the duties and obligations contained in this article if the producer does not give advice or provide services that are otherwise subject to securities laws or engage in any other activity requiring other professional licenses.

E. Under the care obligation under subsection B of this section, the consumer profile information, characteristics of the insurer and product costs, rates, benefits and features are those factors generally relevant in making a determination whether an annuity effectively addresses the consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives, but the level of importance of each factor under the care obligation under subsection B of this section may vary depending on the facts and circumstances of a particular case, and each factor may not be considered in isolation.

F. To satisfy the disclosure obligation, before the recommendation or sale of an annuity, the producer shall prominently disclose the following information to the consumer on a form substantially similar to the "insurance agent (producer) disclosure for annuities" form in appendix A of the 2020 national association of insurance commissioners suitability in annuity transactions model regulation:

1. A description of the scope and terms of the relationship with the consumer and the role of the producer in the transaction.

2. An affirmative statement on whether the producer is licensed and authorized to sell the following products:

4. A description of the sources and types of cash compensation and noncash compensation to be received by the producer, including whether the producer is to be compensated for the sale of a recommended annuity by commission as part of a premium or other remuneration received from the insurer, intermediary or other producer or by fee as a result of a contract for advice or consulting services.

5. A notice of the consumer's right to request additional information regarding cash compensation.Â  On request of the consumer or the consumer's designated representative, the producer shall disclose both of the following:

(a) A reasonable estimate of the amount of cash compensation to be received by the producer, which may be stated as a range of amounts or percentages.

(b) Whether the cash compensation is a onetime or multiple occurrence amount and, if a multiple occurrence amount, the frequency and amount of the occurrence, which may be stated as a range of amounts or percentages.

G. The disclosure obligation under subsection F of this section requires that before or at the time of the recommendation or sale of an annuity, the producer shall have a reasonable basis to believe the consumer has been informed of various features of the annuity, such as the potential surrender period and surrender charge, potential tax penalty if the consumer sells, exchanges, surrenders or annuitizes the annuity, mortality and expense fees, investment advisory fees, any annual fees, potential charges for and features of riders or other options of the annuity, limits on interest returns, potential changes in nonguaranteed elements of the annuity, insurance and investment components and market risk.

H. To satisfy the conflict of interest obligation, the producer shall identify and avoid or reasonably manage and disclose material conflicts of interest, including material conflicts of interest related to an ownership interest.

I. To satisfy the documentation obligation, the producer at the time of recommendation or sale shall:

1. Make a written record of any recommendation and the basis for the recommendation subject to this article.

(a) A customer's refusal to provide the consumer profile information, if any.

(b) A customer's understanding of the ramifications of not providing the consumer profile information or providing insufficient consumer profile information.

3. Obtain a consumer-signed statement on a form substantially similar to the "consumer decision to purchase an annuity not based on a recommendation" form in appendix C of the 2020 national association of insurance commissioners suitability in annuity transactions model regulation acknowledging the annuity transaction is not recommended if a customer decides to enter into an annuity transaction that is not based on the producer's recommendation.

J. Any requirement applicable to a producer under subsections A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H and I of this section applies to every producer who has exercised material control or influence in the making of a recommendation and has received direct compensation as a result of the recommendation or sale, regardless of whether the producer has had any direct contact with the consumer. Activities such as the following do not in and of themselves constitute material control or influence:

1. Providing or delivering marketing or educational material.

2. Product wholesaling or other back-office product support.

3. General supervision of a producer.

K. An insurer's issuance of an annuity subject to this subsection shall be reasonable under all the circumstances actually known to the insurer at the time the annuity is issued.Â  A producer has no other obligation under subsections A, B, C, D and E of this section to a consumer related to an annuity transaction if:

1. No recommendation is made.

2. A recommendation was made that was later found to have been prepared based on materially inaccurate information provided by the consumer.

3. The consumer refuses to provide relevant consumer profile information and the annuity transaction is not recommended.

4. The consumer decides to enter into an annuity transaction that is not based on a recommendation by the producer.

L. Except as allowed under this subsection, an insurer may not issue an annuity recommended to a consumer unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the annuity would effectively address the particular consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives based on the consumer's consumer profile information.Â  Each insurer shall establish and maintain a supervision system that is reasonably designed to achieve the insurer's and its producers' compliance with this article and that includes the following:

1. Reasonable procedures to inform its producers of the requirements of this article, including incorporating the requirements of this article in relevant producer training manuals.

2. Standards for producer product training, including establishing and maintaining reasonable procedures to ensure compliance with section 20-1243.07.

3. Product-specific training and training materials that explain all material features of its annuity products to its producers.

4. Procedures for reviewing each recommendation before issuing an annuity that are designed to ensure there is a reasonable basis to determine that the recommended annuity would effectively address the particular consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives.Â  The review procedures may apply a screening system for the purpose of identifying selected transactions for additional review and may be accomplished electronically or through other means, including physical review. The electronic system or other system may be designed to require additional review of only those transactions that are identified for additional review by the selection criteria.

5. Reasonable procedures to detect recommendations that do not comply with subsections A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, O and P of this section, including confirmation of the consumer's consumer profile information, systematic customer surveys, producer and consumer interviews, confirmation letters, producer statements or attestations and programs of internal monitoring. This paragraph does not prevent an insurer from complying with this paragraph by applying sampling procedures or by confirming the consumer profile information or other required information under this section after issuing or delivering the annuity.

6. Reasonable procedures to assess, before or on issuance or delivery of an annuity, whether a producer has provided to the consumer the information required to be provided under this section.

7. Reasonable procedures to identify and address suspicious consumer refusals to provide consumer profile information.

9. A written annual report to senior management, including to the senior manager responsible for audit functions, that details a review with appropriate testing and that is reasonably designed to determine the effectiveness of the supervision system, the exceptions found and corrective action taken or recommended, if any.

M. An insurer may contract for performance of a function, including maintenance of procedures, required under subsection L of this section but is responsible for taking appropriate corrective action and may be subject to sanctions and penalties pursuant to section 20-1243.05 regardless of whether the insurer contracts for performance of a function and regardless of the insurer's compliance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection.Â  An insurer's supervision system under this subsection shall include supervision of contractual performance under this subsection by incorporating at least both of the following:

1. Monitoring and, as appropriate, conducting audits to ensure that the contracted function is properly performed.

2. Annually obtaining a certification from a senior manager who has responsibility for the contracted function that the manager has a reasonable basis to represent, and does represent, that the function is properly performed.

N. An insurer is not required to include in its system of supervision:

1. A producer's recommendations to consumers of products other than the annuities offered by the insurer.

1. Truthfully responding to an insurer's request for confirmation of the consumer profile information.

2. Filing a complaint.

3. Cooperating with the investigation of a complaint.

P. Recommendations and sales of annuities that comply with comparable standards satisfy the requirements under this article. This subsection applies to all recommendations and sales of annuities made by financial professionals in compliance with business rules, controls and procedures that satisfy a comparable standard even if such a standard would not otherwise apply to the product or recommendation at issue.Â  This subsection does not limit the director's ability to investigate and enforce this article or limit the insurer's obligation to comply with its obligation under subsection L of this section not to issue an annuity recommended to a consumer unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the annuity would effectively address the particular consumer's financial situation, insurance needs and financial objectives based on the consumer's consumer profile information, although the insurer may base its analysis on information received from either the financial professional or the entity supervising the financial professional.Â  An insurer complies with this subsection if the insurer does all of the following:

1. Monitors the relevant conduct of the financial professional seeking to rely on this subsection or the entity responsible for supervising the financial professional, such as the financial professional's broker-dealer or an investment adviser registered under federal or state securities laws using information collected in the normal course of an insurer's business.

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, a disability insurer may not limit or deny the coverage of health care services provided through telehealth, including ancillary services, and may apply only the same limits or exclusions on a health care service provided through telehealth that are applicable to an in-person encounter for the same health care service, except for procedures or services for which the weight of evidence, based on practice guidelines, peer-reviewed clinical publications or research or recommendations by the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607, determines not to be appropriate to be provided through telehealth.

2. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a disability insurer shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system, whether provided through telehealth using an audio-visual format or in-person care.Â  A disability insurer shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent in-person behavioral health and substance use disorder services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system if provided through telehealth using an audio-only format. This paragraph does not apply to a telehealth encounter provided through a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the disability insurer.Â  A disability insurer may not require a health care provider to use a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the disability insurer as a condition of network participation.

3. Before January 1, 2022, a disability insurer shall cover services provided through an audio-only telehealth encounter if that service is reimbursed by medicare or the Arizona health care cost containment system when provided through an audio-only telehealth encounter.Â  Beginning January 1, 2022, a disability insurer shall cover services provided through an audio-only telehealth encounter if the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607 recommends that the services may appropriately be provided through an audio-only telehealth encounter.

4. A health care provider shall bill for a telehealth encounter using the healthcare common procedure coding system and shall identify whether the telehealth encounter was provided in an audio-only or audio-video format.Â  To submit a claim for an audio-only service, the health care provider must make telehealth services generally available to patients through the interactive use of audio, video or other electronic media.

5. At the time of the telehealth encounter, the health care provider shall access clinical information and records, if available, that are appropriate to evaluate the patient's condition.Â  The health care provider shall inform the insured before the telehealth encounter if there is a charge for the encounter.

6. A disability insurer may establish reasonable requirements and parameters for telehealth services, including documentation, fraud prevention, identity verification and recordkeeping, but such requirements and parameters may not be more restrictive or less favorable to health care providers or insureds than are required for health care services delivered in person.

7. Covered telehealth services may be provided regardless of where the insured is located or the type of site.

8. Except in an emergency as prescribed in section 20-2803, the policy may limit the coverage to those health care providers who are members of the disability insurer's provider network.

B. Subsection A of this section does not:

1. Limit the ability of disability insurers to provide incentives to insureds that are designed to improve health outcomes, increase adherence to a course of treatment or reduce risk.

2. Prevent disability insurers from offering network contracts to health care providers that employ value-based purchasing or bundled payment methodologies if otherwise allowed by law or prevent health care providers from voluntarily agreeing to enter into such contracts with a disability insurer.

C. This section does not relieve a disability insurer from an obligation to provide adequate access to in-person health care services.Â  Network adequacy standards required by federal or state law may not be met by a disability insurer through the use of contracted health care providers who provide only telehealth services and do not provide in-person health care services in this state or within fifty miles of the border of this state.

D. This section does not prevent a disability insurer from imposing deductibles or copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or coinsurance applicable to an in-person encounter for the same health care service. If the disability insurer waives a deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement that impacts a health care provider's contracted reimbursement rate, the disability insurer shall reimburse the health care provider for the cost of the deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement to ensure that the health care provider receives the contracted reimbursement rate if the service is covered and the claim meets other requirements of the network participation agreement.

E. Services provided through telehealth or resulting from a telehealth encounter are subject to all of this state's laws and rules that govern prescribing, dispensing and administering prescription pharmaceuticals and devices and shall comply with Arizona licensure requirements and any practice guidelines of the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607 or, if not addressed, the practice guidelines of a national association of medical professionals promoting access to medical care for consumers via telecommunications technology or other qualified medical professional societies to ensure quality of care.

F. This section does not apply to limited benefit coverage as defined in section 20-1137.

G. For the purposes of this section, "telehealth":

1. Means the interactive use of audio, video or other electronic media, including asynchronous store-and-forward technologies and remote patient monitoring technologies, for the purpose of diagnosis, consultation or treatment.

2. Includes:

(a) The use of an audio-only telephone encounter between an insured who has an existing relationship with a health care provider or provider group if both of the following apply:

(i) An audio-visual telehealth encounter is not reasonably available due to the insured's functional status, the insured's lack of technology or telecommunications infrastructure limits, as determined by the health care provider.

(ii) The telehealth encounter is initiated at the request of the insured or authorized by the insured before the telehealth encounter.

(b) The use of an audio-only encounter between the insured and a health care provider, regardless of whether there is an existing relationship with the health care provider or provider group, if the telehealth encounter is for a behavioral health or substance use disorder service and both items of subdivision (a) of this paragraph apply.

3. Does not include the sole use of a fax machine, instant messages, voice mail or email.

B. At the option of the insurer, coverage shall either continue under the existing policy or by the issuance of a converted policy with the person exercising the right to convert designated as the named insured.

I. Except as provided in subsection J of this section, any policy, including a conversion or continuation policy, that is issued under this section shall not be cancelled or nonrenewed except for the following reasons:

1. The individual has failed to pay premiums or contributions in accordance with the terms of the coverage or the insurer has not received premium payments in a timely manner.

2. The individual has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or the individual made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of the coverage.

3. The insurer has ceased to offer coverage to individuals that is consistent with the requirements of sections 20-1379 and 20-1380.

4. If the insurer offers health care coverage in this state through a network plan, the individual no longer resides, lives or works in the service area served by the network plan or in an area for which the insurer is authorized to transact business but only if the coverage is terminated uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of any covered individual.

5. If the insurer offers health care coverage in this state in the individual market only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of the individual in the association has ceased but only if that coverage is terminated uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of any covered individual.

B. To the extent that payment for covered expenses has been made under the state program pursuant to title XIX of the social security act for health care items or services furnished to an individual, the state is considered to have acquired the rights of the individual to payment by any other party for those health care items or services. On presentation of proof that the state program pursuant to title XIX of the social security act has paid for covered items or services, the insurer shall make payments to the state program pursuant to title XIX of the social security act according to the coverage provided in the disability insurance policy.

C. An insurer issuing disability insurance contracts may not impose on a state agency that has been assigned the rights of an individual who is eligible for medical assistance and who is covered for health benefits from the insurer any requirements that are different from the requirements applicable to an agent or assignee of any other covered individual.

D. An insurer issuing disability insurance contracts shall not cancel or fail to renew the contract of any person based on that person's eligibility for or enrollment in a program funded under title XIX of the social security act or title 36, chapter 29 or 34. Nothing in this section prohibits cancellation or failure to renew for nonpayment of monies due under the contract.

#### Section 20-1379. Guaranteed availability of individual health insurance coverage; prior group coverage; definitions

A. Every health care insurer that offers individual health insurance coverage in the individual market in this state shall provide guaranteed availability of coverage to an eligible individual who desires to enroll in individual health insurance coverage and shall not:

1. Decline to offer that coverage to, or deny enrollment of, that individual.

2. Impose any preexisting condition exclusion for that coverage.

B. Every health care insurer that offers individual health insurance coverage in the individual market in this state shall offer all policy forms of health insurance coverage that are designed for, that are made generally available and actively marketed to and that enroll both eligible or other individuals.Â  A health care insurer that offers only one policy form in the individual market complies with this section by offering that form to eligible individuals. A health care insurer also may comply with the requirements of this section by electing to offer at least two different policy forms to eligible individuals as provided by subsection C of this section.

C. A health care insurer shall meet the requirements prescribed in subsection B of this section if:

1. The health care insurer offers at least two different policy forms, both of which are designed for, are made generally available and actively marketed to and enroll both eligible and other individuals.

2. The offer includes at least either:

(a) The policy forms with the largest and next to the largest earned premium volume of all policy forms offered by the health care insurer in this state in the individual market during a period not to exceed the preceding two calendar years.

(b) A choice of two policy forms with representative coverage, consisting of a lower level of coverage policy form and a higher level of coverage policy form, each of which includes benefits that are substantially similar to other individual health insurance coverage offered by the health care insurer in this state and each of which is covered by a method that provides for risk adjustment, risk spreading or a risk spreading mechanism among the health care insurer's policies.

D. The health care insurer's election pursuant to subsection C of this section is effective for policies offered during a period of at least two years.

E. If a health care insurer offers individual health insurance coverage in the individual market through a network plan, the health care insurer may do both of the following:

1. Limit the individuals who may be enrolled under health insurance coverage to those who live, reside or work within the service area for a network plan.

2. Within the service area of a network plan, deny health insurance coverage to individuals if the health care insurer has demonstrated, if required, to the director that both:

(a) The health care insurer will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to additional individual enrollees because of the health care insurer's obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees and individual enrollees.

(b) The health care insurer is applying this paragraph uniformly to individuals without regard to any health status-related factor of the individuals and without regard to whether the individuals are eligible individuals.

F. A health care insurer may deny individual health insurance coverage in the individual market to an eligible individual if the health care insurer demonstrates to the director that the health care insurer:

1. Does not have the financial reserves necessary to underwrite additional coverage.

2. Is denying coverage uniformly to all individuals in the individual market in this state pursuant to state law and without regard to any health status-related factor of the individuals and without regard to whether the individuals are eligible individuals.

G. If a health care insurer denies health insurance coverage in this state pursuant to subsection F of this section, the health care insurer shall not offer that coverage in the individual market in this state for one hundred eighty days after the date the coverage is denied or until the health care insurer demonstrates to the director that the health care insurer has sufficient financial reserves to underwrite additional coverage, whichever is later.

H. An accountable health plan as defined in section 20-2301 that offers conversion policies on an individual or group basis in connection with a health benefits plan pursuant to this title is not a health care insurer that offers individual health insurance coverage solely because of the offer of a conversion policy.

I. This section does not:

1. Create additional restrictions on the amount of the premium rates that a health care insurer may charge an individual for health insurance coverage provided in the individual market.

2. Prevent a health care insurer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual market from establishing premium rates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health promotion and disease prevention.

4. Require a health care insurer offering health care coverage only on a group basis or through one or more bona fide associations, or both, to offer health insurance coverage in the individual market.

J. A health care insurer shall provide, without charge, a written certificate of creditable coverage as described in this section for creditable coverage occurring after June 30, 1996 if the individual:

1. Ceases to be covered under a policy offered by a health care insurer.Â  An individual who is covered by a policy that is issued on a group basis by a health care insurer, that is terminated or not renewed at the choice of the sponsor of the group and where the replacement of the coverage is without a break in coverage is not entitled to receive the certification prescribed in this paragraph but is instead entitled to receive the certification prescribed in paragraph 2 of this subsection.

2. Requests certification from the health care insurer within twenty-four months after the coverage under a health insurance coverage policy offered by a health care insurer ceases.

K. The certificate of creditable coverage provided by a health care insurer is a written certification of the period of creditable coverage of the individual under the health insurance coverage offered by the health care insurer. The department may enforce and monitor the issuance and delivery of the notices and certificates by health care insurers as required by this section, section 20-1380, the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 (P.L. 104-191; 110 Stat. 1936) and any federal regulations adopted to implement the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996. Notwithstanding any other law, an insurer is not required to provide a certificate of creditable coverage if the federal laws that require providing a certificate of creditable coverage are superseded by the prohibition on preexisting condition exclusions.

L. Any health care insurer, accountable health plan or other entity that issues health care coverage in this state, as applicable, shall issue and accept a certificate of creditable coverage of the individual that contains at least the following information:

1. The date that the certificate is issued.

2. The name of the individual or dependent for whom the certificate applies and any other information that is necessary to allow the issuer providing the coverage specified in the certificate to identify the individual, including the individual's identification number under the policy and the name of the policyholder if the certificate is for or includes a dependent.

3. The name, address and telephone number of the issuer providing the certificate.

4. The telephone number to call for further information regarding the certificate.

5. One of the following:

(a) A statement that the individual has at least eighteen months of creditable coverage. For the purposes of this subdivision, "eighteen months" means five hundred forty-six days.

(b) Both the date that the individual first sought coverage, as evidenced by a substantially complete application, and the date that creditable coverage began.

6. The date creditable coverage ended, unless the certificate indicates that creditable coverage is continuing from the date of the certificate.

7. The consumer assistance telephone number for the department.

8. The following statement in at least fourteen-point type:

Important Notice!

Keep this certificate with your important personal records to protect your rights under the health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 ("HIPAA"). This certificate is proof of your prior health insurance coverage. You may need to show this certificate to have a guaranteed right to buy new health insurance ("Guaranteed issue"). This certificate may also help you avoid waiting periods or exclusions for preexisting conditions. Under HIPAA, these rights are guaranteed only for a very short time period. After your group coverage ends, you must apply for new coverage within 63 days to be protected by HIPAA. If you have questions, call the Arizona department of insurance and financial institutions.

M. A health care insurer has satisfied the certification requirement under this section if the insurer offering the health benefits plan provides the certificate of creditable coverage in accordance with this section within thirty days after the event that triggered the issuance of the certificate.

N. Periods of creditable coverage for an individual are established by the presentation of the certificate described in this section and section 20-2310. In addition to the written certificate of creditable coverage as described in this section, individuals may establish creditable coverage through the presentation of documents or other means.Â  In order to make a determination that is based on the relevant facts and circumstances of the amount of creditable coverage that an individual has, a health care insurer shall take into account all information that the insurer obtains or that is presented to the insurer on behalf of the individual.

O. A health care insurer shall calculate creditable coverage according to the following rules:

1. The health care insurer shall allow an individual credit for each day the individual was covered by creditable coverage.

2. The health care insurer shall not count a period of creditable coverage for an individual enrolled under any form of health insurance coverage if after the period of coverage and before the enrollment date there were sixty-three consecutive days during which the individual was not covered by any creditable coverage.

3. The health care insurer shall not include any period that an individual is in a waiting period or an affiliation period for any health coverage or is awaiting action by a health care insurer on an application for the issuance of health insurance coverage when the health care insurer determines the continuous period pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection.

4. The health care insurer shall not include any period that an individual is waiting for approval of an application for health care coverage, provided the individual submitted an application to the health care insurer for health care coverage within sixty-three consecutive days after the individual's most recent creditable coverage.

5. The health care insurer shall not count a period of creditable coverage with respect to enrollment of an individual if, after the most recent period of creditable coverage and before the enrollment date, sixty-three consecutive days lapse during all of which the individual was not covered under any creditable coverage. The health care insurer shall not include in the determination of the period of continuous coverage described in this section any period that an individual is in a waiting period for health insurance coverage offered by a health care insurer, is in a waiting period for benefits under a health benefits plan offered by an accountable health plan or is in an affiliation period.

6. In determining the extent to which an individual has satisfied any portion of any applicable preexisting condition period the health care insurer shall count a period of creditable coverage without regard to the specific benefits covered during that period.

P. An individual is an eligible individual if, on the date the individual seeks coverage pursuant to this section, the individual has an aggregate period of creditable coverage as defined and calculated pursuant to this section of at least eighteen months and all of the following apply:

2. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, a group or blanket disability insurer shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system, whether provided through telehealth using an audio-visual format or in-person care. A group or blanket disability insurer shall reimburse health care providers at the same level of payment for equivalent in-person behavioral health and substance use disorder services as identified by the healthcare common procedure coding system if provided through telehealth using an audio-only format. This paragraph does not apply to a telehealth encounter provided through a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the group or blanket disability insurer.Â  A group or blanket disability insurer may not require a health care provider to use a telehealth platform that is sponsored or provided by the group or blanket disability insurer as a condition of network participation.

2. Prevent group or blanket disability insurers from offering network contracts to health care providers who employ value-based purchasing or bundled payment methodologies if otherwise allowed by law or prevent health care providers from voluntarily agreeing to enter into such contracts with a group or blanket disability insurer.

This section does not prevent a group or blanket disability insurer from imposing deductibles or copayment or coinsurance requirements for a health care service provided through telehealth if the deductible, copayment or coinsurance does not exceed the deductible, copayment or coinsurance applicable to an in-person encounter for the same health care service.Â  If the group or blanket disability insurer waives a deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement that impacts a health care provider's contracted reimbursement rate, the group or blanket disability insurer shall reimburse the health care provider for the cost of the deductible or copayment or coinsurance requirement to ensure that the health care provider receives the contracted reimbursement rate if the service is covered and the claim meets other requirements of the network participation agreement.

E. Services provided through telehealth or resulting from a telehealth encounter are subject to all of this state's laws and rules that govern prescribing, dispensing and administering prescription pharmaceuticals and devices and shall comply with Arizona licensure requirements and any practice guidelines of the telehealth advisory committee on telehealth best practices established by section 36-3607 or, if not addressed, the practice guidelines of a national association of medical professionals promoting access to medical care for consumers via telecommunications technology or other qualified medical professional societies to ensure quality of care.

(a) Divide the insured portion of the second loan by the entire loan indebtedness on the collateral property to determine the per cent coverage.

(b) Divide the entire loan indebtedness on the property by the value of the collateral property at the date of insurance to determine loan-to-value per cent.

(a) Insured by, or for which a commitment to insure has been made by, the federal housing administrator or commissioner pursuant to the federal national housing act, as amended;

(b) Guaranteed by the administrator of veterans' affairs pursuant to the federal servicemen's readjustment act of 1944, as amended, except that if only a portion of a loan is so guaranteed, the limitation shall apply to the portion that is not guaranteed;

2. Acquired in connection with a claim under a policy of title insurance.

3. Acquired in satisfaction or on account of loans, mortgages, liens, judgments or decrees, previously owing to it in the course of its business.

4. Acquired in part payment of the consideration of the sale of real property owned by it if the transaction shall result in a net reduction in the company's investment in real estate.

A title insurer may invest in a title insurance plant, and that plant shall be considered an asset at the actual cost of the plant.Â  The aggregate admitted value of the investment shall not exceed the amount allowed pursuant to the accounting practices and procedures manual adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners.Â  In determining the admitted value of a title insurance plant, no value shall be attributed to furniture and fixtures, and the real estate in which the title plant is housed shall be carried as real estate.Â  The value of title abstracts, title briefs, copies of conveyances or other documents, indices and other records comprising the title insurance plant shall be determined by considering the expenses incurred in obtaining them.Â  Once the title insurance plant is operational its value may be increased only by the acquisition of another title insurance plant by purchase, consolidation or merger.Â  In no event shall the value of the title insurance plant be increased by additions made as part of the normal course of abstracting and insuring titles to real estate.Â  Subject to the limitations prescribed in this subsection, a title insurer may enter into agreements with one or more other title insurers authorized to do business in this state, or with one or more title insurance agents, to participate in the ownership, management and control of a title insurance plant to service the needs of all parties, or in lieu of that common ownership the parties may invest in the stock of a corporation owning and operating a title plant for the same purposes.Â  Subject to the limitations with respect to value set forth in this subsection, any joint investment in existence on the effective date of this section may be continued indefinitely.

H. Nothing in this section applies to any investments made by a title insurer when acting as a trustee.

 

#### Section 20-1565. Additional powers

A. A title insurer may provide any other services reasonably related to the land title business and may engage in any other business which is not inconsistent with the business of issuing title insurance policies and which may be authorized by its corporate charter, but only if such services and businesses are not prohibited to it by this title and if the title insurer qualifies for and obtains any other applicable license or certificate that is required by any other law regulating the services or business.

B. Neither a title insurer nor a title insurance agent shall engage in the business of guaranteeing the payment of the principal or the interest of bonds or other obligations.

#### Section 20-1566. Taxation of title insurers

If the provisions of section 20-230 shall operate to require any foreign title insurer to pay premium tax in this state, such tax shall be computed on total risk premiums received by the insurer during the preceding calendar year on account of title insurance on real property in this state. The provisions of section 20-230 shall operate to require such foreign title insurer to pay only the amount of such net premium tax which is in excess of the net income tax actually paid to this state for the same calendar year by such foreign title insurer. For the purposes of this section only, every foreign title insurer which may be required to pay premium tax in this state may file with the director as a part of or as an amendment to its schedule of fees under subsection A of section 20-376 a statement of the risk premium included in its schedule of fees.

#### Section 20-1567. Determination of insurability required

A. No policy or contract of title insurance shall be written on any risk located in this state except by a title insurer authorized to do business in this state, nor unless and until the title insurer has caused to be conducted a reasonable examination of the title and has caused to be made a determination of insurability of title in accordance with sound underwriting practices for title insurers.

B. No title insurer shall write title insurance in, nor issue any title insurance policy with respect to risks located in, any county of this state with a population, as shown by the latest decennial census, in excess of one hundred thousand persons, unless the title insurer or its agent in that county maintains a title insurance plant covering title records of such county, or unless the insurer issues its policy based on a policy issued to it by another title insurance company, or its agent, who meets the requirements of this section provided, however, that for the purposes of this subsection a title insurer or title insurance agent shall be deemed to maintain a title insurance plant if it is a lessee thereof or joint owner or has a beneficial interest in such a plant.

C. This section shall not apply to a reinsurer or an excess coinsurer, provided the originating insurer complies with subsections A and B.

#### Section 20-1568. Unearned premium reserve

A. Every title insurer shall, in addition to other reserves, establish and maintain a reserve to be known as the "unearned premium reserve" for title insurance on real estate, which shall, at all times and for all purposes, be deemed and shall constitute the unearned portions of premiums due or received on account of such insurance and shall be charged as a reserve liability of such title insurer in determining its financial condition. A foreign title insurer doing business in this state may establish an unearned premium reserve for title insurance on real estate in accordance with the laws of its domiciliary state, provided an unearned premium reserve is mandatory under the law of its domiciliary state and such law is substantially equivalent to the requirements of this title.

B. The unearned premium reserve for title insurance on real estate shall be retained and held by such title insurer for the protection of the policyholders' interest in policies on real estate which have not expired. Except as provided in section 20-1571, assets equal to the amount of such reserve shall not be subject to distribution among other creditors or stockholders of such title insurer until all claims of policyholders or holders of title insurance contracts or agreements of such title insurer have been paid in full and all liability on the policies or title insurance contracts or agreements, whether contingent or actual, has been discharged or lawfully reinsured. Income from the investment of the amount of such reserve shall be the unrestricted property of the title insurer.

#### Section 20-1569. Amount of unearned premium reserve; release

A. The unearned premium reserve of every title insurer shall consist of:

1. The amount of the unearned premium reserve held as of January 1, 1968.

2. The amount of all additions required to be made to the reserve by this section, less withdrawals permitted by this section.

B. Every title insurer shall add to its unearned premium reserve in respect to each title insurance policy, whether primary insurance, reinsurance or coinsurance, issued by it on real estate a sum of money out of the fees due or received for the title insurance and deemed to be unearned portions of fees and a sum equal to ten cents for each one thousand dollars of the face amount of net retained liability, as defined in section 20-1562, and shall separately record the aggregate amounts set aside and reserved with respect to policies, contracts or agreements written in each calendar year.

C. The amounts set aside as additions to the unearned premium reserve shall be deducted in determining net profits of any title insurer.

D. For the purpose of determining the amounts of the unearned premium reserve that may be withdrawn pursuant to subsection E of this section, and the interest of the policyholders under section 20-1571, all policies of title insurance shall be considered as dated on July 1 in the year of issue.

E. The aggregate of the amounts set aside in unearned premium reserve in any calendar year pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be released from the reserve and restored to income in the year of release pursuant to the formula prescribed in the accounting practices and procedures manual adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners.

 

#### Section 20-1570. Maintenance of the unearned premium reserve

If by reason of any cause, other than depreciation in the market value of investments, the amount of the assets of a title insurer held as investments of its unearned premium reserve should on any date be less than the amount required to be maintained by law in such reserve, and the deficiency shall not be promptly cured, such title insurer shall forthwith give written notice thereof to the director and shall issue no further title insurance policies, whether of policy insurance, reinsurance or coinsurance, until the deficiency shall have been eliminated and until it shall have received written approval from the director authorizing it again to issue such policies.

#### Section 20-1571. Use of the unearned premium reserve on liquidation, dissolution or insolvency

A. If an order of rehabilitation or of liquidation shall have been entered with respect to a title insurer in accordance with the provisions of article 4 of chapter 3 of this title, then, and notwithstanding the provisions of such article:

1. Such amount of the assets of such title insurer equal to the unearned premium reserve then remaining as is necessary may be used to pay for reinsurance of the liability of such title insurer upon all outstanding policies of title insurance, as to which claims for losses by the holders are not then pending, the balance, if any, of assets equal to the unearned premium reserve fund then remaining, then to be transferred to the general assets of the title insurer.

2. The assets other than the unearned premium reserve shall be available to pay claims for losses sustained by holders of policies then pending or arising up to the time reinsurance is effected. In the event that claims for losses are in excess of such other assets of the title insurer, such claims, when established, shall be paid pro rata out of the surplus assets attributable to the unearned premium reserve, to the extent of such surplus, if any.

B. In the event that reinsurance is not obtained, the unearned premium reserve and assets constituting minimum capital, or so much as remains thereof after outstanding claims have been paid, shall constitute a trust fund to be held by the director for twenty years, out of which claims of policyholders shall be paid as they arise. The balance, if any, of such fund shall, at the expiration of twenty years, revert to the general assets of the title insurer.

#### Section 20-1572. Reserve for unpaid losses and loss expense

A. Each title insurer shall at all times establish and maintain, in addition to other reserves, a reserve against unpaid losses, and against loss expense, and shall calculate the reserves by making a careful estimate in each case of the loss and loss expense likely to be incurred, by reason of every claim presented, pursuant to notice from or on behalf of the insured, of a title defect in or lien or adverse claim against the title insured, that may result in a loss or cause expense to be incurred for the proper disposition of the claim.Â  The sums of the items estimated pursuant to this section shall be the total amounts of the reserves against unpaid losses and loss expenses of the title insurer.

B. In combination with the reserves prescribed in section 20-1569 and subsection A of this section, each title insurer shall establish a supplemental reserve that consists of all other reserves that are necessary to cover the insurer's liabilities for all losses, claims and loss adjustment expenses.

C. The amounts estimated pursuant to this section may be revised from time to time as circumstances warrant, but shall be redetermined at least once each year.

D. The amounts set aside in the reserves in any year shall be deducted in determining the net profits of any title insurer for that year.

 

#### Section 20-1573. Net retained liability

A. The net retained liability of any title insurer under any single insurance risk as defined in section 20-1562, paragraphs 4 and 7 shall not exceed fifty per cent of the net amount remaining after deducting from the sum of its capital, surplus, unearned premium reserve and voluntary reserves the value, if any, assigned in such summation to its title insurance plants, all as shown in its most recent report on file with the director. The same limitation shall apply to any secondary risk assumed by means of reinsurance or coinsurance except, whenever the primary retained liability of a ceding company shall equal or exceed ten per cent of the single insurance risk liability, the net retained or assumed liability limit of this section may be increased by an additional two hundred fifty thousand dollars, but in no event above one hundred per cent of the net amount remaining after deducting from the sum of its capital and surplus the value, if any, assigned in such summation to its title insurance plants, all as shown by its most recent report on file with the director.

B. Nothing in this section is intended to limit the amount of a single insurance risk, as defined in section 20-1562, paragraph 7, that may be written or assumed by a title insurer, provided, however, that every title insurer shall cede, to one or more other title insurers, on or before the effective date of such writing or assumption, such portion, or portions, of any risk as shall be sufficient to bring its net retained liability thereunder within the limits set forth in this section; and provided further that each such cession of risk shall also be within the limits of this section as applied to the sum of the capital, surplus, unearned premium reserve and voluntary reserves, less the value, if any, assigned in such summation to the title insurance plants of the assuming and reinsuring title insurer, as shown by its most recent report on file with the supervisory agency in the state of its domicile.

#### Section 20-1574. Power to reinsure

A. Any title insurer authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state may cede reinsurance of all or any part of its liability under one or more of its title insurance policies to any title insurer authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this or any other state, provided, however, that no larger amount of reinsurance shall be ceded to any title insurer on a single policy of title insurance, or on any single title insurance risk, than such title insurer would be permitted to retain if authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state.

B. Any title insurer authorized to do business in this state may also reinsure policies of title insurance issued by other companies on risks whether located in this state or elsewhere.

C. Issuance of contracts of reinsurance by a title insurer not authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state, but authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in any of the United States, reinsuring a title insurer authorized to engage in the business of title insurance in this state on real property located in this state, shall not of itself constitute the doing of business in this state by such reinsurer.

D. No agreement by any domestic title insurer for the reinsurance of all or substantially all its business in force shall be effective unless it shall comply with the provisions of section 20-732.

#### Section 20-1575. Foreign title insurers; resident agent required

A. A title insurer that is not incorporated under the laws of this state, but is authorized to transact business herein, shall not make, write, place or cause to be made, written or placed any policy or contract of insurance covering real property in this state except:

1. No such merger or consolidation shall be effectuated unless in advance thereof, the plan and agreement therefor have been filed with the director. The director shall examine the terms and conditions of such merger or consolidation, and of any exchange of shares or securities pursuant thereto, after holding a hearing at which all persons or parties to whom it is proposed to issue shares or securities in such exchange shall have the right to appear. After such hearing, the director shall either approve or disapprove the fairness of such terms and conditions of exchange.

After such hearing, the director shall either approve or disapprove the fairness of such terms and conditions of such acquisition and exchange. The director shall give such approval within a reasonable time after filing of a plan or agreement unless he finds such plan or agreement either:

1. Is contrary to law.

2. Is inequitable to the stockholders of any title insurer or abstract company involved.

3. Would substantially reduce the security of and services to be rendered to policyholders of the domestic title insurer in this state or elsewhere.

B. No such purchase or acquisition of a domestic title insurer shall be effectuated unless approved as provided in subsection A of this section.

C. If at any time the director determines that a title insurance agent has failed to comply with any applicable provision of law other than any provision of title 6, chapter 7, has been guilty of fraudulent conduct toward the public or any title insurer, or has violated any applicable insurance law, he may, after notice and hearing, revoke the license of such agent.

#### Section 20-1582. Title insurance agents; replies to inquiries by director

Every title insurance agent shall promptly reply, in writing, with a copy thereof to each title insurer for which the agent is acting, to any inquiry of the director relative to the business of title insurance, and failure to reply shall be a ground for revocation of the agent's license.

A. As used in this article "personal or controlled insurance" means a policy of title insurance where the insured or one of the insureds under such policy is, or the loss thereunder is payable to:

2. For credit property insurance offered after the extension of credit by other than direct mail advertisements, the disclosures required by subsection A, paragraphs 1, 5 and 6 may be provided orally or electronically if both of the following occur:

(a) The following oral disclosure is also made to a debtor who elects to purchase any consumer credit insurance:

You will be receiving important written information about the insurance you have chosen to purchase and your rights.Â  We recommend that you read and carefully review this information as soon as you receive it.

This coverage may duplicate existing coverage if you have a residential property insurance policy.Â  It applies to any item of covered property on which you owe a debt.Â  This coverage is primary, so it is the first source to be used in the event of a loss on property it covers.Â  You may cancel this coverage at any time by calling the insurer at the telephone number provided to you or by writing to the insurer.Â  We are charging you a premium that may be based on things for which a claim cannot be made, such as services, meals or other consumables, entertainment, finance or service fees, loan interest, delivery charges or other insurance premiums.

E. All credit property insurance shall be evidenced by an individual policy or a certificate of insurance that shall be delivered to the debtor.

F. In addition to other requirements of law, the individual policy or certificate of insurance shall contain all of the following information:

1. The name and home office address of the insurer.

2. The name of each debtor, or, in the case of a certificate of insurance, the identity by name or otherwise of each debtor.

3. The premium or amount of payment by the debtor, except that, for open-end loans, the premium rate and balance to which the rate applies shall be specified.

4. A full description of the coverage or coverages, including the amount and term and any exceptions, limitations and exclusions.

A statement that the benefits shall be paid to the creditor to reduce or extinguish the unpaid debt or, for credit personal property insurance coverage, to repair or replace the property and, whenever the amount of loss payment exceeds the unpaid debt, that any excess payment is payable to the debtor.

6. If the scheduled term of the insurance is less than the scheduled term of the credit transaction, a statement to that effect on the face of the individual policy or certificate of insurance in not less than twelve point bold face type.

G. Policies issued to cover open-end consumer transactions shall provide that the policyholder or certificate holder will be furnished the following disclosure notice with the account statement at least annually in no smaller than ten point type:

You are paying credit property insurance premiums based on the outstanding balance of this account.Â  You may cancel this coverage at any time by calling the insurer at the telephone number the insurer has provided to you or by writing to the insurer.Â  Your premium may be based on things for which a claim cannot be made, such as services, meals or other consumables, entertainment, finance or service fees, loan interest, delivery charges or other insurance premiums.

H. The policy shall be delivered to the debtor when the insurer accepts the insurance, except that a policy issued in conjunction with an open-end credit agreement or requested after the date the indebtedness is incurred may be delivered within thirty days of the date the debtor requests insurance.

#### Section 20-1621.04. Rates and forms; filing; approval; withdrawal of approval

A. A person shall not deliver, or issue for delivery in this state, any credit property insurance policy or rate unless the person has first filed the form or rate with the director and the director has approved the form or rate.Â  Unless the director issues an order affirmatively approving or disapproving the form or rate within thirty days after filing, the form or rate is deemed approved.Â  On written notice given to the insurer within the thirty day period, the director may extend the thirty day review period for up to fifteen additional days.

B. The director shall disapprove a rate or form if either:

1. The rate is inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or excessive or not reasonable in relation to the coverage provided.

2. The form contains provisions that are unjust, unfair, inequitable, ambiguous, misleading or deceptive, that encourage misrepresentation of the coverage or that are contrary to this title or of any rule adopted pursuant to this title.

C. If the director disapproves a rate or form, the director shall send the insurer a written notice specifying the reason for disapproval.Â  The insurer may request a hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10 to contest the disapproval.Â  It is unlawful for the insurer to issue or use a rate or form that has been disapproved.

D. At any time after notice and for cause shown, the director may issue an order withdrawing approval of any form or rate for any reason listed in subsection B.Â  The insurer may request a hearing pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10 to contest the director's order.

E. An insurer shall not issue or use a rate or form after the effective date of an order withdrawing approval.

F. An insurer shall not issue any credit property insurance policy for which the rates have not been filed with the director.

 

 

#### Section 20-1621.05. Reasonableness of benefits in relation to premium charged

A. An insurer's premium rates shall be reasonable in relation to the benefits provided and shall not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.

B. At least once every three years, the director shall establish by order a loss ratio standard.Â  In establishing the loss ratio standard, the director shall consider the standard prescribed in subsection A of this section and the actual and expected loss experience of insurers, including a reasonable catastrophe provision.Â  The director shall also consider other rate components, including reasonable general and administrative expenses, reasonable acquisition expenses, reasonable creditor compensation, investment income, premium taxes, licenses, fees, assessments and reasonable underwriting profit and contingencies.

C. Concurrently with the establishment of a loss ratio standard pursuant to subsection B of this section, the director, by order, shall establish prima facie rates.Â  If an insurer's actual rates do not exceed the prima facie rates, the insurer's rates are presumed not to be excessive and the insurer is not required to file its rates with the director, subject to the following:

1. On or before April 1 of each year, on a form prescribed by the director, the insurer shall certify to the director that the rates currently applied by the insurer do not exceed the prima facie rates and that the rates are not inadequate or unfairly discriminatory.Â  The insurer shall also state the actual rates then in effect.Â  If the insurer changes the rates before the next April 1, the insurer shall file an amended certification with the director.

2. At any time the director may require the insurer to make rate filings according to section 20-1621.04.

D. The reasonable cost of actuarial or other professional services necessary to perform the duties required by this section are chargeable as examination expenses pursuant to section 20-159 and shall be allocated among insurers transacting credit property insurance or credit unemployment insurance in this state in proportion to the relative amounts of combined direct credit property and credit unemployment insurance premiums received in this state for the calendar year immediately before the date of the director's order pursuant to this section.

 

 

#### Section 20-1621.06. Experience reports

An insurer transacting credit property insurance in this state shall annually file with the director and the national association of insurance commissioner's a report of credit property insurance written on a calendar year basis.Â  The report shall use the credit insurance supplement annual statement blank approved by the commissioners, and shall contain data separately for each state, rather than an allocation of the company's countrywide experience.Â  The filing shall be made in accordance with and no later than the due date in the instructions to the annual statement.

#### Section 20-1621.07. Cancellation and refund of unearned premium

On cancellation for any reason, the debtor is entitled to a refund of unearned premiums calculated on a daily pro rata basis, except that an insurer is not required to make any refund of less than five dollars.

A. A creditor shall promptly report all claims to the insurer or its designated claim representative.

B. All claims shall be paid either by draft drawn on the insurer, by electronic funds transfer, by check of the insurer to the order of the claimant to whom payment of the claim is due pursuant to the policy provisions or on direction of the claimant to the party specified by the claimant.

C. A person shall not authorize a person, firm or corporation, other than the insurer or its designated claim representative, to settle or adjust claims.Â  The creditor shall not be designated as claim representative for the insurer in adjusting claims, except that once the amount is determined, a group policyholder, by arrangement with the group insurer, may draw drafts, checks or electronic transfers in payment of claims due to the group policyholder subject to audit and review by the insurer.

D. A person shall not deny a claim because the debtor was ineligible for coverage later than ninety days after the initiation of coverage unless the debtor misrepresented a material fact.Â  If a claim is denied because the debtor was ineligible for coverage within ninety days of initiation of coverage or because the debtor misrepresented a material fact for coverage, the insurer shall refund to the debtor all premiums paid and the creditor shall refund any finance charge paid on the premiums.

 

 

#### Section 20-1621.09. Cease and desist order; hearing

On finding that a person has violated this article or a rule adopted pursuant to this article, the director may issue an order directing that the person cease and desist from committing the violation.Â  On the issuance of an order to cease and desist, the person may request a hearing pursuant to section 20-161 and title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

 

 

#### Section 20-1621.10. Rules

The director may adopt any rules reasonably necessary to carry out and effectuate this article.

#### Section 20-1621.11. Penalties

In addition to any other penalties authorized by this title, after notice and a hearing, the director may impose on an insurer that violates an order of the director that is issued pursuant to this article or any rule adopted pursuant to this article a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars for each violation but not to exceed an aggregate penalty of one hundred thousand dollars, except that, if the violation was committed flagrantly in a conscious disregard of this article, the civil penalty shall not be more than twenty-five thousand dollars for each violation but not to exceed an aggregate penalty of two hundred fifty thousand dollars.

### Article 11 - Cancellation or Nonrenewal of Motor Vehicle Insurance

#### Section 20-1631. Definition of motor vehicle; cancellation of or failure to renew coverage; limitations; limitation of liability; exceptions; insurance producers; definitions

A. In this article, unless the context otherwise requires, "motor vehicle" means a licensed land, motor-driven vehicle but does not mean:

1. A private passenger or station wagon type vehicle used as a public or livery conveyance or rented to others.

2. Any other four-wheel motor vehicle of a load capacity of fifteen hundred pounds or less that is used in the business of transporting passengers for hire, used in business primarily to transport property or equipment, used as a public or livery conveyance or rented to others.

3. Any motor vehicle with a load capacity of more than fifteen hundred pounds.

4. A vehicle that otherwise qualifies as a motor vehicle under this subsection but only while the driver of the vehicle is logged in to a transportation network company's digital network or software application to be a driver or is providing transportation network services, unless expressly covered by the private passenger policy.

B. A motor vehicle used as a public or livery conveyance or rented to others does not include a motor vehicle used in the course of volunteer work for a tax-exempt organization as described in section 501(c)(3) of the internal revenue code.

C. An insurer shall not cancel or refuse to renew a motor vehicle insurance policy solely because of the location of residence, age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin or ancestry of anyone who is an insured, except that an insurer may refuse to renew a motor vehicle insurance policy if a named insured establishes a primary residence in a state other than this state.

D. An insurer shall not issue a motor vehicle insurance policy in this state unless the cancellation and renewal conditions of the policy or the endorsement on the policy includes the limitations required by this section.Â  After a policy issued in this state has been in effect for sixty days, or if the policy is a renewal, effective immediately, the company shall not exercise its right to cancel the insurance afforded under the policy unless:

1. The named insured fails to discharge when due any of the obligations of the named insured in connection with the payment of premium for this policy or any installment of the premium.

2. The insurance was obtained through fraudulent misrepresentation.

3. The named insured, any person who resides in the same household as the named insured and who customarily operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy or any other person who regularly and frequently operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy:

(a) Has had the person's driver license suspended or revoked during the policy period.

(b) Develops a permanent disability, either physically or mentally, and the person does not produce a certificate from a physician or a registered nurse practitioner testifying to the person's ability to operate a motor vehicle.

(c) Is or has been convicted during the thirty-six months immediately preceding the effective date of the policy or during the policy period of:

(i) Criminal negligence resulting in death, homicide or assault and arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle.

(ii) Operating a motor vehicle while in an intoxicated condition or while under the influence of drugs.

(iii) Leaving the scene of an accident.

(iv) Making false statements in an application for a driver license.

(v) Reckless driving.

4. The insurer is placed in rehabilitation or receivership by the insurance supervisory official in its state of domicile or by a court of competent jurisdiction or the director has suspended the insurer's certificate of authority based on its financially hazardous condition.

5. The named insured, any person who resides in the same household as the named insured and who customarily operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy or any other person who regularly and frequently operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy uses a motor vehicle rated or insured under the policy as a private passenger motor vehicle regularly and frequently for commercial purposes.

6. The named insured, any person who resides in the same household as the named insured and who customarily operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy or any other person who regularly and frequently operates a motor vehicle insured under the policy uses a motor vehicle rated or insured under the policy to provide transportation network services unless, while the driver is logged in to the transportation network company's digital network or software application to be a driver or is providing transportation network services, the named insured either:

(a) Has procured an endorsement to the private passenger policy that expressly provides such coverage.

(b) Is covered by a motor vehicle liability insurance policy issued by another insurer expressly providing such coverage.

7. The director determines that the continuation of the policy would place the insurer in violation of the laws of this state or would jeopardize the solvency of the insurer.

E. An insurer may nonrenew a motor vehicle insurance policy if the insurer complies with this article.Â  An insurer shall provide notice of a nonrenewal to the named insured as prescribed by section 20-1632. A named insured who disputes the nonrenewal of the named insured's policy may file an objection with the director pursuant to section 20-1633.

F. The company shall not cancel the insurance when a person other than the named insured has violated subsection D, paragraph 3 of this section, if the named insured in writing agrees to exclude as insured the person by name when operating a motor vehicle and further agrees to exclude coverage to the named insured for any negligence that may be imputed by law to the named insured arising out of the maintenance, operation or use of a motor vehicle by the excluded person.Â  The written agreement that excludes coverage under a policy for a named individual is effective for each renewal of the policy by the insurer and remains in effect until the insurer agrees in writing to provide coverage for the named individual who was previously excluded from coverage.

G. This article does not apply to any policy that has been in effect less than sixty days at the time notice of cancellation is mailed or delivered by the insurer unless the policy is a renewal policy, or to policies:

1. Insuring any motor vehicle other than a private passenger motor vehicle as defined in section 20-117.

2. Insuring the motor vehicle hazard of garages, motor vehicle sales agencies, repair shops, service stations or public parking places.

3. Providing insurance only on an excess basis.

H. If a consumer purchases motor vehicle insurance coverage from an insurance producer licensed in this state, the insurance producer that owns the policy expiration shall remain the insurance producer of record for that insured. If the insurer terminates the insurance producer's contract, the insurance producer shall continue to provide customary services to the insured. The insurer shall provide the insurance producer with a minimum degree of authority necessary to provide customary services to the insured and shall provide the same level of compensation for these services that were in effect before the termination of the insurance producer contract.

I. Subsection H of this section does not apply if one or more of the following conditions exist:

1. The insurance producer of record has had its license suspended or revoked by the department.

2. The insurance producer of record is indebted to the insurer.

3. The insured has supplied the insurer with a written request that its insurance producer of record be changed to another insurance producer of the insurer.

4. The insurance producer of record has authorized transfer of this account to another licensed insurance producer of the insurer.

5. The director has determined after a public hearing that continuation of this relationship is not in the best interest of the public.

6. The insurance producer of record is under an exclusive contract or contract requiring the insurance producer to submit all eligible business to an insurer or group of insurers under a common management.

J. Subsection H of this section does not apply to any transaction in which the expiration of the policies is owned by the insurer.

K. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if an insurer chooses to renew a policy, the issuance at renewal of revised policy provisions to modify an existing policy by adding coverages or policy provisions, modifying coverages or policy provisions or eliminating coverages or policy provisions is not a nonrenewal or cancellation of the policy if the modification of a basic coverage does not eliminate the essential benefit of that basic coverage. If the modification of the basic coverage eliminates the essential benefit of the basic coverage, the director shall order the insurer to remove the modification from the policy.Â  This subsection does not allow the insurer, without the written consent of the insured, to eliminate the basic coverages of the policy or to reduce the monetary limits of any of the basic coverages of the policy that were selected and agreed on. If an insurer chooses to renew a policy, this subsection does not limit a policyholder from continuing to renew uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage pursuant to section 20-259.01. For the purposes of this subsection, "basic coverage" means any of the following:

1. Bodily injury coverage.

2. Property damage coverage.

3. Uninsured motorist coverage.

4. Underinsured motorist coverage.

5. Medical payments coverage.

6. Comprehensive coverage.

7. Collision coverage.

L. For the purposes of this section, fail to renew or nonrenewal does not include the issuance and delivery of a new policy within the same insurer or an insurer under the same ownership or management as the original insurer as provided in this subsection.Â  An insurer may transfer any of its policies to an affiliated insurer.Â  An insurer may not transfer policyholders because of their location of residence, age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin or ancestry. A transfer by an insurer pursuant to this subsection does not allow the insurer to apply a new unrestricted sixty-day period for cancellation or nonrenewal.

M. Except as provided in this subsection, an insurer shall not refuse to renew a policy, based on an insured's failure to maintain membership in a bona fide association, until both the insurer and bona fide association have complied with this subsection and shall not refuse to renew any coverage continuously in effect before September 1, 1998, subject to all the following:

1. In addition to any other reason provided in this section, an insurer may refuse to renew an insurance policy issued pursuant to this article if all of the following conditions apply:

(a) The insurer clearly discloses to the applicant and the insured in the application for insurance and insurance policy that both the payment of dues and current membership in the bona fide association are prerequisites to obtaining or renewing the insurance.

(b) Any money paid to the bona fide association as a membership fee:

(i) Is not used by the insurer directly or indirectly to defray any costs or expenses in connection with the sale or purchase of the insurance.

(ii) Is set independently of any factor used by the insurer to make any judgment or determination about the eligibility of any individual, including the member, an employee of a member or a dependent of a member, to purchase or renew the insurance.

(c) The bona fide association has filed a certification with the director verifying the eligibility of the insurer to refuse to renew an insurance policy based on membership in the bona fide association.

2. To qualify as a bona fide association pursuant to this subsection, the association shall meet all of the requirements of this paragraph. The association shall file a statement with the director at least thirty days before the commencement of the offer or sale of insurance as provided by this subsection verifying that the association meets the requirements of this paragraph. The association shall update the filing required by this paragraph at least thirty days before the effective date of any material change in the information contained in the statement and shall file a separate notice with the director if the insurance described in the statement is no longer available through the association. The statement shall include the following information:

(a) That the association has been in active existence for at least five consecutive years immediately before the filing of the statement.

(b) That the association has been formed and maintained in good faith for purposes other than obtaining or providing insurance and does not condition membership in the association on the purchase of insurance.

(c) That the association has articles of incorporation and bylaws or other similar governing documents.

(d) That the association does not condition membership in the association or set membership fees on the eligibility of any individual, including the member, an employee of the member or a dependent of the member, to purchase or renew the insurance, or on any factor that the insurer could not lawfully consider when setting rates.

(e) That the association has a relationship with a specific insurer or insurers and identifies the insurer or insurers.

3. Membership fees collected by the bona fide association are not premiums of the insurer that issued the coverage unless the bona fide association:

(a) Uses any portion of the membership fees directly or indirectly to defray any costs or expenses in connection with the sale or purchase of the insurance.

(b) Sets or adjusts membership fees for any member of the bona fide association based on any factor used by the insurer that issues the insurance to make any judgment or determination about the eligibility of any individual, including the member, an employee of the member or a dependent of the member, to purchase or renew the insurance.

4. If the membership fees constitute premiums pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection, an insurer shall not refuse to renew a policy as otherwise allowed by this subsection.

N. An insurer or insurance producer shall not inquire on an application for a motor vehicle insurance policy whether the applicant, any person who resides in the same household as the applicant and who customarily operates a motor vehicle to be insured under the policy or any other person who regularly and frequently operates a motor vehicle to be insured under the policy has been nonrenewed by an insurer.

O. An insurer may issue an endorsement to a private passenger policy that expressly provides coverage for the provision of transportation network services, but that endorsement may not be treated as basic coverage as defined in subsection K of this section and any termination of the endorsement may not be treated as a modification of basic coverage. An insurer may terminate the endorsement allowed by this subsection by giving advance notice of the termination. Any notice by the insurer to the policyholder to terminate the endorsement allowed by this subsection shall be sent to the named insured at least forty-five days before the effective date of the termination.Â  The notice shall include an explanation to the named insured that the further provision of transportation network services following the effective date of the termination might subject the insured to cancellation or nonrenewal of the insured's private passenger motor vehicle policy.

P. This section and section 28-4009 do not create an obligation of an insurer to offer, provide or issue a policy or an endorsement that includes coverage for any liability incurred while a transportation network company driver is logged in to the transportation network company's digital network or software application to be a driver or is providing transportation network services.

Q. For the purposes of this section, "transportation network company", "transportation network company driver" and "transportation network services" have the same meanings prescribed in section 28-9551.

#### Section 20-1632. Cancellation, nonrenewal and reduction of limits for reasons other than nonpayment of premium; notices to insured; refund of unearned premium

A. A notice by the insurer to the policyholder of cancellation or reduction in the limits of liability or coverage for reasons other than nonpayment of premium shall be sent to the named insured at least ten days before the effective date of the cancellation or reduction in limits of liability or coverage. Notice of nonrenewal for reasons other than nonpayment of premium shall be sent at least forty-five days before the effective date of the nonrenewal. A notice under this subsection shall include or be accompanied by all of the following:

1. A statement in writing of the specific facts that constitute the reasons, consistent with this article, for such action by the insurer and a notice indicating the named insured's right to complain to the director of the insurer's action within ten days after receipt of the notice by the insured.

2. Notice of the insured's possible eligibility for insurance through the automobile assigned risk plan, and the notice shall state that all information included in the notice is given pursuant to this article.

3. Except as provided in paragraph 4 of this subsection, a refund of unearned premium. For the purposes of this paragraph, the insurer shall either send the notice and refund of unearned premium together at least ten days before the effective date or send the notice before the refund of unearned premium if both the notice and the refund of unearned premium are sent separately to the insured at least ten days before the effective date.Â  As an alternative to sending the refund by mail, an insurer may refund the unearned premium by any electronic means previously established with the insured to make and receive premium payments for the policy.

4. In the case of a notice of cancellation or nonrenewal of a policyholder whose premium payment is collected and remitted on the insurer's behalf by the insurer's affiliate, the insurer shall refund any unearned premium to the policyholder within ten days after the policy cancellation or nonrenewal. For the purposes of this paragraph, "affiliate" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-481.

B. Failure of the insurer to comply with subsection A of this section shall invalidate any cancellation, nonrenewal or reduction in limits of liability or coverage.

C. If a premium has been financed, a refund of unearned premium shall be returned as provided in section 6-1416.

#### Section 20-1632.01. Cancellation or nonrenewal for nonpayment of premium; grace period; notice of cancellation; discrimination; definition

A. Motor vehicle insurance policies shall contain a provision that the policyholder is entitled to a minimum grace period of seven days for the payment of any premium due except the first payment, during which grace period the policy shall continue in full force. For the purposes of this subsection, an initial payment on the renewal of a policy is not a first payment of premium.

B. For any motor vehicle insurance policy that is cancelled or nonrenewed for nonpayment of premium by the insurer after the grace period, the insurer must send a notice of cancellation or nonrenewal to the policyholder.Â  The cancellation or nonrenewal is effective on the date the notice is sent to the policyholder.Â  The notice shall include or be accompanied by a statement in writing of the reasons for such action by the insurer and a notice indicating the named insured's right to complain to the director of the insurer's action within ten days after receipt of the notice by the insured. An insurer shall not cancel or nonrenew a motor vehicle insurance policy pursuant to this section because of the named insured's location of residence, age, race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry or driving record.

C. This section does not apply to policies being cancelled pursuant to section 6-1415. The grace period provided in such policies shall be satisfied by the ten-day notice of intent of the premium finance company to cancel the insurance contract unless the default is cured within the ten-day period.

D. For the purposes of this section, "grace period" means the period of time after the premium due date during which the policy remains in force without penalty even though the premium due has not been paid.

#### Section 20-1633. Objections; investigation; determination

A. Any individual who believes cancellation of the individual's policy is arbitrary, capricious or otherwise in violation of this article, who believes nonrenewal is in violation of this article or who believes notice of nonrenewal or cancellation, or the reasons for nonrenewal or cancellation, were not given as provided by this article, within ten days after receipt of notice, may file in writing an objection to the action with the director.

B. On receipt of a written objection pursuant to this article, the director shall notify the insurer of receipt of the objection and of the right of the insurer to file a written response within ten days of receipt of the notification.Â  The director may also order an examination of the objection or complaint, the submission of additional information by the insured or the insurer about the action by the insurer or the objections of the insured, or any other procedure as the director deems appropriate or necessary.Â  The insurer shall pay the cost of the examination pursuant to section 20-159.Â  Within fifteen days of receipt of the written objection by an insured the director shall approve or disapprove the insurer's action and shall notify the insured and insurer in writing of the director's final decision.Â  The director shall order an insurer that has failed to renew a policy in violation of this article to reinstate the policy retroactive to the effective date of the nonrenewal.Â  Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, either party may institute proceedings for judicial review of the director's final decision pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6. Notwithstanding any other law, if the director decides in favor of the insured, the director may order that the decision not be stayed pending judicial review.

 

#### Section 20-1634. Immunity

The director or any person who in good faith furnishes to the insured or insurer information as to reasons for cancellation or nonrenewal of a motor vehicle policy shall not be liable to any party for providing such information.

### Article 12 - Cancellation or Nonrenewal of Insurance

This article shall apply to policies of insurance, other than motor vehicle insurance and workers' compensation insurance, on risks located or resident in this state which insure any of the following contingencies:

1. Loss of or damage to real property which is used predominantly for residential purposes and which consists of not more than four dwelling units.

2. Loss of or damage to personal property in which natural persons resident in specifically described real property of the kind described in paragraph 1 have an insurable interest, except personal property used in the conduct of a commercial or industrial enterprise.

3. Legal liability of a natural person for loss, damage or injury to persons or property, but not including policies primarily insuring risks arising from the conduct of a commercial or industrial enterprise.

#### Section 20-1652. Grounds for valid notice of cancellation; inquiries; definitions

A. After a policy has been in effect for sixty days or, if the policy is a renewal, effective immediately, a notice of cancellation is not effective unless it is based on the occurrence, after the effective date of the policy, of one or more of the following:

1. Nonpayment of premium.

2. Conviction of the named insured of a crime arising out of acts increasing the hazard insured against.

3. Acts or omissions by the insured or the insured's representative constituting fraud or material misrepresentation in obtaining the policy, continuing the policy or presenting a claim under the policy.

4. Discovery of grossly negligent acts or omissions by the insured substantially increasing any of the hazards insured against.

5. Substantial change in the risk assumed by the insurer, since the policy was issued, except to the extent that the insurer should reasonably have foreseen the change or contemplated the risk in writing the contract.

6. A determination by the director that the continuation of the policy would place the insurer in violation of the insurance laws of this state.

7. Failure of the insured to take reasonable steps to eliminate or reduce any conditions in or on the insured premises that contributed to a loss in the past or will increase the probability of future losses.

B. If nonrenewal is based on the condition of the premises, the insured shall be given thirty days' notice to remedy the identified conditions.Â  If the identified conditions are remedied, coverage shall be renewed.Â  If the identified conditions are not satisfactorily remedied, the insured shall be given an additional thirty days, on payment of premium, to cure the defective condition. Any insured who believes nonrenewal under this subsection is arbitrary or capricious may use the appeal procedures set forth in section 20-1633.

C. If an insurer uses for underwriting purposes information from a report provided by, or database maintained by, an insurance support organization or consumer reporting agency related to the premises that is the subject of the application or to the person applying for insurance, the insurer shall obtain that information as soon as practicable on application by a person for insurance coverage and before the issuance of a binder of insurance coverage. Failure of the insurer to timely obtain the information required by this subsection precludes the insurer from declining insurance coverage or terminating a binder of insurance coverage based on the information. This subsection does not apply to a policy renewal.

D. This section does not affect the provisions of section 20-1120.

E. After thirty days from the application by an insured for insurance coverage, no declination of insurance coverage or termination of a binder shall be based on information from a consumer report, including a consumer report provided by, or database maintained by, an insurance support organization or consumer reporting agency related to the premises that is the subject of the application or to the person applying for insurance. Notwithstanding any other law, an insurer may decline or terminate insurance coverage based on the condition of the premises as determined through a physical inspection of the premises.

F. An insurer shall not consider as a claim any inquiry by an insured into whether a policy will cover a loss or about the type or level of coverage.Â  An insurer shall not use such an inquiry, regardless of the source of the information that an inquiry was made, as a basis for declining, nonrenewing or canceling insurance coverage or a binder of insurance coverage.Â  An insurer shall not submit to any insurance support organization or consumer reporting agency that a mere inquiry was made to the insurer as to the terms or coverage of a policy of insurance.Â  An inquiry into coverage on a property insurance policy is not a claim activity unless an actual claim is filed by the insured that results in an investigation of the claim by the insurer.

G. For the purposes of this section, nonrenewal does not include the issuance and delivery of a new policy within the same insurer or an insurer under the same ownership or management as the original insurer as provided in this subsection. An insurer may transfer any of its policies to an affiliated insurer. An insurer may not transfer a policyholder because of the policyholder's location of residence, age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin or ancestry. A transfer by an insurer pursuant to this subsection does not allow the insurer to apply a new unrestricted sixty-day period for cancellation or nonrenewal.

H. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Consumer reporting agency" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-2102.

2. "Insurance support organization" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-2102.

#### Section 20-1653. Sending notice of cancellation or nonrenewal to insured; statement of grounds and facts on which cancellation or nonrenewal is based

All notices of cancellation or nonrenewal shall be in writing, shall be sent to the named insured and shall state, with respect to cancellation of policies in effect after the time limits specified in section 20-1652 and, in the case of nonrenewal of policies as specified in section 20-1654:

1. In the case of cancellation the specific facts that constitute the grounds set forth in section 20-1652 relied on.

2. In the case of nonrenewal the specific facts that constitute the reason the policy is not being renewed, which may include the grounds set forth in section 20-1652.

#### Section 20-1654. Sending notice of intention not to renew to insured; time; term of policy

A. Unless the insurer, at least thirty days before the end of the policy period, sends to the named insured notice of its intention not to renew the policy or to condition its renewal on reduction of limits or elimination of coverages, the insurer shall not fail to renew the policy on payment of the premium due on the effective date of the renewal, in accordance with the then existing rating manual of the insurer.

B. For the purposes of this section:

1. Any policy written for a term of less than one year may be renewed for a term of one year if the notice is not given as required by subsection A of this section. For the purposes of subsection A of this section, a policy with no fixed expiration date is deemed written for successive policy periods of one year.

2. Nonrenewal does not include the issuance and delivery of a new policy within the same insurer or an insurer under the same ownership or management as the original insurer as provided in this paragraph. An insurer may transfer any of its policies to an affiliated insurer. An insurer may not transfer a policyholder because of the policyholder's location of residence, age, race, color, religion, sex, national origin or ancestry. A transfer by an insurer pursuant to this paragraph does not allow the insurer to apply a new unrestricted sixty-day period for cancellation or nonrenewal.

C. This section does not apply if the insured has accepted replacement coverage or has agreed to nonrenewal.

#### Section 20-1655. Liability of insurer and representatives for statements in notice of cancellation, other communication or evidence given in court relating to cancellation

There shall be no liability on the part of, and no cause of action of any nature shall arise against, any insurer or its authorized representatives, agents or employees, or any licensed insurance producer, for any statement made, unless shown to have been made in bad faith with malice in any of the following:

1. Written notice of cancellation or nonrenewal or in any other oral or written communication specifying the reasons for cancellation or nonrenewal.

2. Communication providing information pertaining to such cancellation or nonrenewal.

3. Evidence submitted at any court proceeding or informal inquiry in which such cancellation or nonrenewal is an issue.

#### Section 20-1656. Proof of sending as proof of notice

A. Proof of sending a notice of cancellation and the reasons for cancellation or of intention not to renew to the named insured by mail at the address shown in the policy is sufficient proof of the notice required by this article.

B. Any method of proof retained by the insurer for sending a notice of cancellation by any method other than by mail is sufficient proof of the notice required by this article.

A.

B. From the time of such recording there exists a lien for an amount equal to the reasonable value of services to be performed under a life care contract in favor of each resident and contract holder on the land and improvements of the facility's properties owned by the provider, not exempt from execution, which are listed in the notice of lien filed pursuant to subsection C of this section and which are located in the county in which the notice of lien is recorded.

If separate actions are commenced, the court may consolidate such actions. The court shall, as part of the costs, allow reasonable attorney's fees for each claimant who is a party to the action.

The lien for the reasonable value of services to be performed under a life care contract shall be on equal footing with claims of other residents and contract holders. If a sale is ordered and the property sold and the proceeds of the sale are not sufficient to discharge all liens of residents and contract holders against the property, the proceeds shall be prorated among the respective residents and contract holders.

G. The liens provided for in this section are preferred to all liens, mortgages or other encumbrances upon the property attaching subsequently to the time the lien is recorded and are preferred to all unrecorded liens, mortgages and other encumbrances. The amount secured by any lien having priority to the lien filed pursuant to this section may not be increased without prior approval of the director.

H. The director shall file a release of the lien upon proof of complete performance of all obligations to residents and contract holders pursuant to life care contracts.

The principal of the escrow account may be invested with the earnings thereon payable to the provider, and up to one-sixth of the total principal shall be released to the provider upon notice to the director. The escrow agreement shall provide that upon withdrawal of any such amount by the provider, the escrow agent shall provide immediate written notice of such withdrawal to the director and that any amount released to the provider shall be repaid to the escrow account within two years of the release of such amount.

For good cause, the director may extend the due date for a provider to file its annual report and pay the required fee.

B. A provider shall amend its annual report on file with the department at any time, without the payment of any additional fee, if an amendment is necessary to prevent the annual report from containing a material misstatement of fact or omitting to state a material fact required to be stated.

C. Any provider, manager or promoter shall comply with the requirements of this section as follows:

1. Information required by section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraph 5 shall be filed:

(a) Immediately on the substitution or installation of a member of the board of directors or an officer, trustee or managing partner different from the information disclosed in the provider's application or submission pursuant to subdivision (b).

(b) Every three years after the initial filing of the biographical affidavit by the provider.

2. Certified financial statements required by section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraph 15 for the two most recent fiscal years shall be filed with the annual report by the provider and manager only. The certified financial statements of the promoter shall be filed with the annual report unless the promoter is not currently employed by the provider.

3. The actuarial study required by section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraph 17 shall be filed by the provider on a triennial basis beginning with the year in which resident occupancy began at the facility or contract holders began receiving services pursuant to the permit issued to the provider. The director may require a provider to file an actuarial study on a more frequent basis if the director deems it necessary and may adjust subsequent triennial filings accordingly.

D. A provider shall not change the fiscal year end date disclosed pursuant to section 20-1802, subsection B, paragraph 4 without the prior approval of the director. The director shall approve the change if the commissioner of the internal revenue service grants a request for a change of a fiscal year pursuant to 26 United States Code

E. Assets shall be reported at values determined pursuant to sections 20-511 through 20-515.Â  If the director deems it necessary to value any real estate the director may employ one or more competent appraisers for that purpose, and the reasonable expense shall be borne by the provider.

#### Section 20-1808. Ratio of assets to liabilities; report; rehabilitation of provider

A. The provider shall possess assets in the first year of operation equal to at least seventy-five percent of the unamortized endowment fees plus all other liabilities including long-term debt. The unamortized endowment fees shall be based on life expectancy of purchasers.Â  Thereafter, the provider shall at all times possess assets in an amount sufficient to assure full performance of the obligations of the provider pursuant to life care contracts including any reserve fund escrow required by the director pursuant to section 20-1806.

B. If revenues or funds including reserves are inadequate or projected to be inadequate pursuant to the annual report or an actuarial report or if the provider does not meet the requirements of subsection A of this section, the director may employ an independent management consultant experienced in the operation of life care facilities, at the expense of the provider, who shall examine the financial structure and operations of the provider and make recommendations on remedial action to the director. The director shall not be bound by such recommendations.

C. If at any time the director receives notice from the escrow agent that section 20-1806 has not been complied with, if at any other time when the director has reason to believe that the provider is in a financially unsound or unsafe condition or that its condition is such that it may otherwise be unable to fully perform its obligations pursuant to life care contracts, if the provider fails to implement the director's recommendations as a result of a management consultant's report or if it is obvious to the director that to obtain the services of a financial consultant under subsection B of this section would be futile, the director, through the attorney general, shall apply to the superior court in the county in which the provider's facility is located for an order directing the director to assume management and possession of the provider's facility and to rehabilitate the provider to enable it to fully perform its obligation pursuant to life care contracts.

Within forty-five days after the effective date of the initial order of the director issued pursuant to section 20-2202, the directors of the association shall submit to the director for his review a proposed plan of operation consistent with the provisions of this chapter.

The plan shall contain provisions pertaining to preliminary assessment of all members for initial expenses necessary to commence operations, establishment of necessary facilities, management of the association, assessment of members or surcharging of insureds to defray losses and expenses, commission arrangements, reasonable and objective underwriting standards, acceptance and cession of reinsurance, retention of servicing carriers or other servicing arrangements, procedures for determining amounts of insurance to be provided by the association and retention of persons necessary to effectuate the purposes of this chapter.

#### Section 20-2206. Approval of plan of operation

A. The plan of operation prepared pursuant to section 20-2205 is subject to approval by the director after consultation with the members of the association and other affected individuals and organizations.

Amendments to the plan of operation may be made by the directors of the association, subject to the approval of the director, or shall be made at the direction of the director consistent with the provisions of section 20-2206.

#### Section 20-2208. Policies issued by the association; claims-made basis

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a liability insurance policy issued by the association shall be on a claims-made basis. The policy form shall be filed with and approved by the director.

#### Section 20-2209. Claims-made policy; cancellation

A policy issued pursuant to this chapter may provide that the association may cancel any of its policies for the reasons specified in section 20-1673 or in the event of nonpayment of any premium assessment or other charge by sending to the insured written notice at least ten days before the effective date of the cancellation.

#### Section 20-2210. Occurrence riders; premiums; assessments

A. All policies written by the association shall contain a provision that guarantees the insured that the association shall issue, on the written demand of any insured to whom it has issued a claims-made policy, an occurrence rider comparable to that provided in the voluntary market.

B. The premium for the occurrence rider shall not exceed the total amount that the insured would have paid for occurrence policies, if the occurrence policies had been issued to the insured by the association, less the total amount that the insured paid for claims-made policies issued to him by the association. However, if a majority of the directors of the association concludes that the occurrence rider premium would be inadequate, the directors may request the actuary provided for in section 20-2211 to determine whether a premium surcharge based on the experience of the policyholder should be required. Based on his actuarial opinion, the actuary may recommend to the director a premium surcharge of no more than ten per cent of the initial net occurrence rider premium. If the director approves a recommended surcharge, the surcharge shall be imposed no earlier than the end of the policy term. Individual policyholders may pay for an occurrence rider on a quarterly basis for a period of not to exceed two years. If the policyholder fails to make payment, the occurrence rider is void. A policyholder electing to pay for the occurrence rider on a deferred payment basis may be assessed a finance charge of not to exceed six per cent per year on the unpaid balance. A private insurer issuing a liability insurance policy on an occurrence or claims-made basis which replaces or begins coverage on the expiration of a policy issued by the association may provide liability coverage for acts or omissions by the insured which occurred during the period the association's policy was in effect, excluding liability for any claim of injury or loss made to the association during the period.

#### Section 20-2211. Rates; actuary

A. The rates, rating plans, rating rules, rating classifications and territories applicable to insurance written by the association, and the statistics relating thereto, are subject to the provisions of chapter 2, article 4.1 of this title, giving consideration to the past and prospective loss and expense experience for the designated class or classes of liability insurance, trends in the frequency and severity of losses, the investment income of the association and other relevant information. The premium rates for an occurrence policy and a claims-made policy for each year the association issues policies shall be established by the association. In determining whether the association's rates are not inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory, the director shall consider recommendations made by the actuary. All rates shall be on an actuarially sound basis, giving consideration to the group retrospective rating plan, and shall be calculated to be self-supporting, except that the total initial expenses necessary to establish, commence and manage operations may be amortized over a period of at least five years. Such rates shall be deemed not inadequate if they are so constituted that the expenses and loss costs of the plan of operation are equal to or exceeded by the premium. Competition or lack of competition shall not be considered as a rating standard under this section.

B. All policies issued by the association are subject to a group retrospective rating plan under which the final premium for all policyholders of the association, as a group, shall be equal to administrative, servicing and contingency expenses, modified as applicable in accordance with subsection A, loss and loss adjustment expenses, and taxes. Policyholders shall be given full credit for all investment income, net of expenses and a reasonable management fee on policyholder supplied monies. The maximum final premium for all policyholders of the association, as a group, is limited as provided in this chapter.

C. The director shall examine the association as often as he deems appropriate to ensure that the group retrospective rating plan is being operated in a manner consistent with this section. If he finds that it is not being so operated, he shall issue an order to the association, specifying in what respect its operation is deficient and stating what corrective action shall be taken.

#### Section 20-2212. Deficits; equitable assessments; premium tax credits

A. On a determination that within the next one hundred eighty days thereafter the association will be unable to pay its outstanding lawful obligations as they mature in the regular course of business as shown by an excess of such lawful obligations over admitted assets, the association shall certify to the director the existence of this condition.

B. At the time of certification, the association shall submit a schedule of policyholder surcharges and a plan of member assessments which, in combination, are sufficient to assure the continued sound financial operation of the association. The surcharge may not exceed ten per cent of the total premium paid for a policy or policies obtained through the association. Member assessments shall not exceed one per cent of each member's net direct premium in this state attributable to the line of insurance, the writing of which requires it to be a member of the association.

C. Any member of the association subject to an assessment in any one calendar year shall be allowed a premium tax credit beginning in the following calendar year, at the rate of twenty per cent per year for five years.

D. The association shall certify to the director the estimated amount of any deficit remaining after the termination of all underwriting activities of the association. Policyholder surcharges are limited to ten per cent of the annual premium.

#### Section 20-2213. Initial assessment; temporary contribution by members

A. An initial assessment of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed by the director on every participating insurer of the association to defray the initial operating expenses of the plan. The initial assessment may be refunded by the association.

B. If sufficient monies are not available for the sound financial operation of the association as provided for in this chapter, all members shall contribute to the financial requirements of the association in the manner provided for in this chapter. Any such contributions shall not exceed one per cent annually of each member's net direct premium attributable to the liability insurance the member writes as a requirement for membership in the association pursuant to section 20-2202, subsection A.

C. If the association determines that the applicant meets the underwriting standards of the association, as prescribed in the plan of operation, the association, on receipt of the premium or the portion of the premium as is prescribed in the plan of operation, shall cause a policy of liability insurance to be issued.

#### Section 20-2214. Member participation in writings, expenses, servicing allowance, management fees and losses

H. Continuation coverage ends on the earliest of the following:

1. Eighteen months after the date the continuation coverage begins.

2. The date on which coverage ceases under the health benefits plan due to the enrollee's failure to timely pay the premium and administrative fee.

3. The date on which the enrollee or a qualified dependent becomes eligible for medicare or medicaid or obtains any other health care coverage, with respect only to that person.

4. The date on which the employer terminates coverage under the health benefits plan for all employees. If the employer terminates coverage under the health benefits plan for all employees and replaces the plan with coverage under another plan, the enrollee and any qualified dependents who have continuation coverage have the right to become covered under the new plan for the balance of the period that the enrollee or qualified dependent could have remained covered under the continuation coverage.

The qualified dependent shall notify the employer within thirty days after the social security administration determines that the qualified dependent no longer has a disability under title II or title XVI of the social security act.

J. If a qualifying event as defined in subsection N, paragraph 3, subdivision (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section occurs during the eighteen-month continuation period, a qualified dependent may be eligible to continue coverage for an additional eighteen months.

K. If an enrollee is in the military reserve or national guard and is called to active duty and the enrollee's employment is terminated either after or during the active duty period, the termination is a separate qualifying event, distinct from the qualifying event that may have occurred when the enrollee was called to active duty, and the enrollee and any qualified dependent are eligible for a new eighteen-month benefit period beginning on the later of the date active duty ends or the date of employment termination.

L. If an enrollee is in the military reserve or national guard and is called to active duty, the following events are qualifying events distinct from the qualifying event that may have occurred when the enrollee was called to active duty:

1. The enrollee dies during the period of active duty.

2. A divorce or legal separation of the enrollee from the enrollee's spouse occurs.

3. A dependent child ceases to be a dependent child under the requirements of the employer's health benefits plan.

M. Notwithstanding subsection H of this section, if an enrollee who is in the military reserve or national guard has elected to continue coverage and is thereafter called to active duty and the coverage under the employer's health benefits plan is terminated by the enrollee or the health benefits plan due to the enrollee becoming eligible for a health care program provided by the United States department of defense, the eighteen-month period or any other applicable maximum time period for which the enrollee would otherwise be entitled to continuation coverage is tolled during the time that the enrollee is covered under the health care program.Â  Within sixty-three days after the federal health care program coverage terminates, the enrollee may elect to continue coverage under the employer's health benefits plan retroactively to the date coverage terminated under the federal health care program for the remainder of the eighteen-month period or any other applicable time period, subject to termination of coverage at the earliest of the conditions specified in subsection H of this section.

(d) The enrollee becoming eligible for medicare.

(e) A dependent child ceasing to be a dependent child under the generally applicable requirements of the employer's health benefits plan.

6. The director of the department of insurance and financial institutions may waive the requirement to establish an audit committee pursuant to paragraph 5 of this subsection if the risk retention group demonstrates to the director that doing so is impracticable and the risk retention group's board of directors is otherwise able to fulfill the requirements of the audit committee as set forth in this section.

7. The board of directors shall adopt and disclose governance standards by making the information available through electronic means, such as posting the information on the risk retention group's website, or other means, and providing that information to members and insureds on request.Â  The information shall include all of the following:

#### Section 20-2604. Variable life insurance policy and filing requirements

A. Except pursuant to chapter 5, article 1 of this title, the director shall not approve a variable life insurance form unless the insurer files with the director its variable life insurance policies, and all riders, endorsements, applications and other documents that are attached to the policy and that relate to the variable nature of the policy, and the director approves each policy before the policy is delivered or issued for delivery in this state. For the purposes of this subsection the procedures and requirements for the filing and approval of variable life insurance policies shall be the same as the filing and approval procedures that apply to other life insurance policies, to the extent those procedures are not inconsistent with this article.

B. A variable life insurance policy that is delivered or issued for delivery in this state shall comply with the following minimum requirements:

1. The insurer shall bear mortality and expense risks. The mortality and expense charges are subject to the maximums stated in the policy.

2. For scheduled premium policies, the insurer shall provide a minimum death benefit in an amount that equals or exceeds the initial face amount of the policy as long as the insured pays the premiums.

3. The policy shall reflect the investment experience of one or more separate accounts that are established and maintained by the insurer. The insurer shall demonstrate that the reflection of investment experience in the variable life insurance policy is actuarially sound.

4. Each variable life insurance policy shall be credited with the full amount of the net investment return that is applied to the benefit base.

5. At least annually the insurer shall determine any changes in the variable death benefits of each variable life insurance policy.

6. At least monthly the insurer shall determine the cash value of each variable life insurance policy. The method of computation of cash values and other nonforfeiture benefits shall be in accordance with actuarial procedures that recognize the variable nature of the policy. If the net investment return that is credited to the policy at all times from the date of issue is equal to the assumed investment rate with premiums and benefits determined accordingly under the terms of the policy, the resulting cash values shall not be less than the minimum values that are required by section 20-1231 for a general account policy with these premiums and benefits. The assumed investment rate shall not exceed the maximum interest rate permitted under section 20-1231. If the policy does not contain an assumed investment rate the method of computation shall be based on the maximum interest rate permitted under section 20-1231. The method of computation may disregard incidental minimum guarantees as to the dollar amounts payable. For the purposes of this paragraph incidental minimum guarantees include a guarantee that the amount payable at death or maturity shall equal or exceed the amount that otherwise would have been payable if the net investment return credited to the policy at all times from the date of issue had been equal to the assumed investment rate.

C. The insurer may base the computation of values that are required for each variable life insurance policy on any reasonable and necessary approximations that the director accepts.

D. Each variable life insurance policy that is filed for approval in this state shall contain at least the following:

(c) Describes any minimum death benefit that is required pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 2 of this section.

(d) Describes the method or refers to the policy provision that describes the method for determining the amount of insurance payable at death.

(ii) The value of the amounts that are allocated to any separate accounts under the policy on the date the returned policy is received by the insurer or the insurer's insurance producer.

(f) Identifies the owner of the contract.

(g) Includes items that are required for fixed benefit life insurance policies and that are not inconsistent with this article.

2. For scheduled premium policies, a grace period provision of not less than thirty-one days from the premium due date. The grace period shall provide that if the premium is paid within the grace period, the policy values will be the same as if the premium had been paid on or before the due date, except for the deduction of any overdue premium.

3. For flexible premium policies, a grace period provision that begins on the policy processing day on which the total charges that are authorized by the policy and that are necessary to keep the policy in force until the next policy processing day exceed the amounts available under the policy to pay the charges according to the terms of the policy. The grace period shall end on a date not less than sixty-one days after the report to policyholders is mailed pursuant to section 20-2609, paragraph 1. The death benefit that is payable during the grace period shall equal the death benefit that was in effect immediately before the grace period less any overdue charges. If the policy processing days occur monthly, the insurer may require the payment of not more than three times the charges that were due on the policy processing day on which the amounts available under the policy were insufficient to pay all of the charges that are authorized by the policy and that are necessary to keep the policy in force until the next policy processing day.

4. For scheduled premium policies, a reinstatement provision that states that the policy shall be reinstated at any time within two years from the date of default on the occurrence of all of the following:

(a) The written application of the insured and on the presentation of evidence of insurability, including good health, that is satisfactory to the insurer, unless the cash surrender value has been paid or the period of extended insurance has expired.

(c) Payment of an amount not exceeding the greater of:

(i) All overdue premiums with interest at a rate of not more than six per cent per annum compounded annually and any indebtedness in effect at the end of the grace period following the date of default with interest at a rate of not more than six per cent per annum compounded annually.

(ii) One hundred ten per cent of the increase in cash value resulting from reinstatement plus all overdue premiums for incidental insurance benefits with interest at a rate of not more than six per cent per annum compounded annually.

6. A provision that designates the separate account to be used and that states both of the following:

13. A statement that the investment policy of the separate account shall not be changed without the approval of the insurance regulatory authority of the insurer's state of domicile and that the approval is on file with the director.

14. A provision that except if variable death benefits are used to pay premiums the payment of variable death benefits in excess of any minimum death benefits, cash values, policy loans or partial withdrawals or the payment of variable death benefits in excess of any partial surrenders may be deferred either:

(a) For up to six months from the date of the request, if the payments are based on policy values that do not depend on the investment performance of the separate account.

5. For scheduled premium policies, if the indebtedness exceeds the cash surrender value, the insurer shall give notice of its intent to cancel the policy if the excess indebtedness is not repaid within thirty-one days after the date on which the notice was mailed. For flexible premium policies, if the total charges that are authorized by the policy and that are necessary to keep the policy in force until the next following policy processing day exceed the amounts available under the policy to pay the charges, the insurer must send the policyholder a report containing the information specified by section 20-2609, paragraph 3.

F. The policy may provide that, as long as the premiums are paid, if, at any time, the variable death benefit is less than it would have been if a loan or withdrawal had not been made, the policyholder may increase the variable death benefit up to the amount it would have been if a loan or withdrawal had not been made. The insured may increase the variable death benefit by paying an amount that does not exceed one hundred ten per cent of the corresponding increase in cash value and by furnishing any evidence of insurability that the insurer requests.

G. The policy may specify a reasonable minimum amount that may be borrowed at any time. The minimum does not apply to any automatic premium loan provision.

H. If the policy is under an extended insurance nonforfeiture option, a policy loan provision is not required.

I. Variable life insurance policyholders who exercise their rights under policy loan provisions shall not be disadvantaged by the exercise of those rights.

J. On the exercise of any policy loan provision, the amounts paid to the policyholder shall be withdrawn from the separate account and shall be returned to the separate account on repayment, except that a stock insurer may provide the amounts for policy loans from the general account.

2. Offer incidental insurance benefits on a fixed or variable basis.

3. Offer to pay dividend amounts in cash. In addition, the policies may offer the following dividend options:

(a) The amount of the dividend may be credited against premium payments.

#### Section 20-2605. Reserve liabilities for variable life insurance

A. Reserve liabilities for variable life insurance policies shall be established under section 20-510 according to actuarial procedures that recognize the variable nature of the benefits provided and any mortality guarantees.

B. Reserve liabilities for the guaranteed minimum death benefit shall be the reserve amount that is needed to provide for the contingency of death occurring when the guaranteed minimum death benefit exceeds the death benefit that would otherwise be paid in the absence of the guarantee. The insurer shall maintain reserve liabilities in the general account. Reserve liabilities shall not be less than the greater of any of the following minimum reserves:

1. Assuming an immediate one-third depreciation in the current value of the assets in the separate account followed by a net investment return equal to the assumed investment rate, the aggregate total of the term costs on each variable life insurance contract, if any, covering either:

(a) A period of one full year from the valuation date.

(b) If less than the amount under subdivision (a) of this paragraph, the period that is provided for in the guarantee and that is not otherwise provided for by the reserves held in the separate account.

2. The aggregate total of the attained age level reserves on each variable life insurance contract. The attained age level reserve on each variable life insurance contract shall not be less than zero and shall equal the residue of the prior year's attained age level reserve on the contract. Any residue shall be increased or decreased by a payment that is computed on an attained age basis pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph:

(a) The residue of the prior year's attained age level reserve on each variable life insurance contract shall not be less than zero and shall be determined by adding interest at the valuation interest rate to the prior year's reserve, by deducting the tabular claims based on any excess, if any, of the guaranteed minimum death benefit over the death benefit that would be payable in the absence of the guarantee and by dividing the net result by the tabular probability of survival. The excess shall be based on the actual level of death benefits that would have been in effect during the preceding year in the absence of the guarantee and shall take account of the reserve assumptions regarding the distribution of death claim payments over the year.

(b) The payment shall be computed so that the present value of a level payment of that amount each year over the future period for which charges for this risk will be collected under the contract or if no future charges for this risk will be collected under the contract, the payment shall equal (A) minus (B) minus (C). For the purposes of this subdivision:

(i) (A) means the present value of the future guaranteed minimum death benefits.

(ii) (B) means the present value of the future death benefits that would be payable in the absence of the guarantee and that is computed by assuming a net investment return of the separate account that may differ from the assumed investment rate or the valuation interest rate, or both, but that may not exceed the maximum interest rate that is permitted for the valuation of life contracts.

(iii) (C) means any residue as prescribed by subdivision (a) of this paragraph of the prior year's attained age level reserve on the variable life insurance contract.

3. The valuation interest rate and mortality table that are used to compute the guaranteed minimum death benefit and the future death benefit that would be payable in the absence of the guarantee shall conform to permissible standards for the valuation of life insurance contracts. In determining the minimum reserves, the insurer may employ suitable approximations and estimates, including groupings and averages.

C. According to the actuarial procedures appropriate to the benefit, the insurer shall maintain reserve liabilities for all fixed incidental insurance benefits and any guarantees that are associated with variable accidental insurance benefits in the general account and shall maintain reserve liabilities for all variable aspects of the variable incidental insurance benefits in a separate account.

#### Section 20-2606.Â  Separate accounts

A. A domestic insurer issuing variable life insurance contracts shall establish one or more separate accounts pursuant to section 20-651.Â  The following apply to the establishment of separate accounts:

1. If no law governs the custody of separate account assets and if the insurer is not the custodian of the separate account assets, all contracts for the custody of the assets shall be in writing and the director may review and approve both the terms of a contract and the proposed custodian before the transfer of custody.

2. Without the director's prior written approval, the insurer shall not employ any person in connection with the handling of separate account assets who within the last ten years either:

until the total of the

 Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  bonds equals $5,000,000

4. The insurer shall value the assets of the separate accounts at least monthly.

B. The insurer shall maintain in each separate account assets with a value that is at least equal to the greater of the valuation reserves for the variable portion of the variable life insurance policies or the benefit base for the variable life insurance policies.

C. The following apply to investments by the separate account:

1. An insurer or any of its affiliates may not make any sale, exchange or other transfer of assets between any of its separate accounts or between any other investment account and one or more of its separate accounts unless both:

(a) If assets are transferred into a separate account, the transfer is made solely to establish the account or to support the operation of the policies with respect to the separate account to which the transfer is made.

(b) The transfer, whether into or from a separate account, is made by a transfer of cash.Â  The director may approve theÂ  transfer of other assets in advance of the transfer.

2. The separate account shall have sufficient net investment income and readily marketable assets to meet anticipated withdrawals under the policies that are funded by the account.

D. Except for securities issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the United States, a separate account shall not purchase or otherwise acquire the securities of any issuer if immediately after the purchase or acquisition the value of the investment, together with any prior investments of the account in the security that is valued pursuant to this article, exceeds ten per cent of the value of the assets of the separate account.Â  The director may waive this limitation in writing if the director believes that the waiver will not render the operation of the separate account hazardous to the public or to the policyholders in this state.

E. A separate account shall not purchase or otherwise acquire the voting securities of any issuer if as a result of the purchase or acquisition the insurer and its aggregated separate accounts will own more than ten per cent of the issuer's total issued and outstanding voting securities.Â  The director may waive this limitation in writing if the director believes that the waiver will not render the operation of the separate account hazardous to the public or to the policyholders in this state or jeopardize the independent operation of the issuer of the securities.

F. The ten per cent limitation under subsection D of this section does not preclude the investment of separate account assets in shares of investment companies that are registered pursuant to the investment company act of 1940 (15 United States Code sections 80a-1 through 80a-64) or in other pools of investment assets if the investments and investment policies of the investment companies or asset pools comply substantially with subsection C of this section and with any other applicable provisions under this article.

G. The insurer shall value investments of the separate account at their market value on the date of valuation or at amortized cost if it approximates market value.

H. A domestic insurer shall not change its investment policy of a separate account without first filing the change with the director.Â  A change that is filed pursuant to this subsection is effective sixty days after the date on which it was filed with the director, unless the director notifies the insurer before the end of the sixty day period of the director's disapproval of the proposed change.Â  At any time, after notice and a public hearing, the director may disapprove any change that has become effective. The director may disapprove the change if the director determines that the change would be detrimental to the interests of the policyholders who participate in the separate accounts.

I. Before or contemporaneously with the delivery of the policy, the insurer shall disclose to the insured in writing all charges that may be made against the separate account, including the following:

1. Taxes or reserves for taxes that are attributable to investment gains and income of the separate account.

7. Charges for incidental insurance benefits.

J. The board of directors of each insurer that seeks approval to enter into the variable life insurance business in this state shall adopt written standards of conduct relating to the purchase or sale of investments of separate accounts.Â  The standards of conduct are binding on the insurer and its officers, directors, employees and affiliates.Â  The adoption of a code of ethics that meets the requirements of section 17j of the investment company act of 1940 satisfies this section.

K. A law that applies to the officers and directors of insurance companies with respect to conflicts of interest also applies to the members of a committee or any other similar body of a separate account.

L. An insurer shall not enter into a contract under which a person for a fee undertakes to regularly furnish investment advice to the insurer with respect to its separate accounts that are maintained for variable life insurance policies unless the contract is in writing, the contract states that the insurer may terminate the contract without penalty to the insurer or the separate account on sixty days' written notice to the investment advisor and one of the following applies:

2. The person who provides the advice is an investment manager under the employee retirement income security act of 1974 (29 United States Code sections 1001 through 1461) with respect to the assets of each employee benefit plan that are allocated to the separate account.

(a) The name and form of the organization, the state of organization and the proposed advisor's principal place of business.

(b) The names and addresses of the proposed advisor's partners, officers and directors and of persons who perform similar functions if the investment advisor is an individual.

(c) A written standard of conduct that complies in substance with subsection J of this section.

(d) A statement that is submitted by the proposed advisor to the insurer and that states with respect to each of the following that the proposed advisor or a person associated with the proposed advisor has not:

(ii) Been permanently or temporarily enjoined by a court order, judgment or decree from acting as an investment advisor, underwriter, broker or dealer, acting as an affiliated person or an employee of an investment company, bank or insurance company or engaging in or continuing any conduct or practice in connection with any enjoined activity.

#### Section 20-2609. Policyholder reports

An insurer that delivers or issues for delivery in this state a variable life insurance policy shall send the following reports to each variable life insurance policyholder:

1. Within thirty days after each anniversary of the policy, a statement or statements of the cash surrender value, the death benefit, any partial withdrawal or policy loan, any interest charge and any optional payments that are allowed under the policy and that are computed as of the policy anniversary date. The statement may be furnished within thirty days after a specified date in each policy year if the information contained in the statement is computed not more than sixty days before the notice is sent. This statement shall state that the cash values and the variable death benefit may increase or decrease according to the investment experience of the separate account and shall prominently identify any value that the statement describes and that may be recomputed before the next statement required by this section. If the policy guarantees that the variable death benefit on the next policy anniversary date will not be less than the variable death benefit specified in the statement, the statement shall be modified to indicate this policy guarantee. In addition, the report must show the projected cash value and cash surrender value, if different, as of one year from the end of the period covered by the report. In determining the projected value, the insurer shall assume that the planned periodic premiums, if any, are paid as scheduled, that the guaranteed costs of insurance are deducted and that the net return is equal to the guaranteed rate, or if there is no guaranteed rate, is not greater than zero. If the projected value is less than zero, the statement shall include a warning message that the policy may be in danger of terminating without value in the next twelve months unless additional premium is paid.

(e) A statement of any change in the investment objective and orientation of the separate account, in any investment restriction or material quantitative or qualitative investment requirement that applies to the separate account or in the investment advisor of the separate account.

3. For flexible premium policies, if the amounts that are available under the policy on any policy processing day to pay the charges that are authorized by the policy are less than the amount necessary to keep the policy in force until the next following policy processing day, a report that indicates the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the policy to keep the policy in force and the length of the grace period for the payment of that amount.

That, on cessation of the payment of considerations under a contract, the company will grant a paid-up annuity benefit on a plan that is described in the contract and that complies with subsection G of this section. The description shall include a statement of the mortality table, if any, and the guaranteed or assumed interest rates that are used in calculating annuity payments.

2. If a contract provides for a lump sum settlement at maturity or at any other time, that, on the surrender of the contract at or before the commencement of any annuity payments, the company will pay in lieu of any paid-up annuity benefit a cash surrender benefit that is described in the contract and that complies with subsection H of this section. The contract may provide that the company reserves the right to defer the determination and payment of any cash surrender benefit for any period during which the New York stock exchange is closed for trading except for normal holidays or in which the securities and exchange commission determines that a state of emergency exists.

(b) The amount of any indebtedness on the contract, including interest due and accrued.

(c) An annual contract charge that is not less than zero and that is equal to the lesser of thirty dollars or two per cent of the end of year contract value, less the amount of any annual contract charge that is deducted from any gross considerations credited to the contract during the contract year.

(d) A transaction charge of ten dollars for each transfer to another separate account or to another investment division within the same separate account.

2. The net investment return to be credited to a contract shall be determined at least monthly.

For the purposes of this subsection, "net investment return" means the rate of investment return that is in an amount that does not exceed the actual expense not offset by other deductions and that is credited to the variable annuity contract according to the terms of the contract after deductions for tax charges, if any, for asset charges either at a rate that does not exceed the rate stated in the contract, or if the contract is issued by a nonprofit corporation under which the contract holder participates fully in the investment, for mortality and expense experience of the account.

E. The percentages of net considerations that are used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount under subsection D of this section shall meet one of the following requirements:

1. For contracts that provide for periodic considerations, the net considerations for a given contract year that are used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount not less than zero and shall be equal to the corresponding gross considerations that are credited to the contract during that contract year less an annual contract charge of thirty dollars, less a collection charge of one dollar twenty-five cents for each periodic consideration credited to the contract during that contract year, and less any charges for premium taxes. The percentages used to calculate the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be as follows:

(a) For the first contract year, sixty-five per cent of the net considerations.

(b) For each renewal contract year, eighty-seven and one-half per cent of the net considerations, except that for any portion of the total net consideration for a renewal contract year that exceeds by not more than two times the sum of those portions of the net considerations in all prior contract years for which the percentage was sixty-five per cent, the percentage to be applied to this amount shall be sixty-five per cent.

2. For contracts that provide for a single consideration, the net consideration that is used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be the gross consideration less a seventy-five dollar contract charge and less any charges for premium taxes. The percentage of the net consideration shall be ninety per cent. The annual thirty dollar contract charge, the collection charge of one dollar twenty-five cents per collection and the seventy-five dollar single consideration contract charge will be adjusted to reflect changes in the consumer price index pursuant to subsection F of this section.

F. A demonstration that a contract's nonforfeiture amounts comply with this section shall be based on the following assumptions, unless the company demonstrates the suitability of alternative assumptions:

1. The testing of values shall occur at the end of each of the first twenty contract years.

2. A net investment return of seven per cent per year.

8. If the contract provides for the allocation of considerations to both fixed and variable accounts, allocate one hundred per cent of the considerations to the variable account.

G. A paid-up annuity benefit that is available under a variable annuity contract shall be in an amount so that its present value on the annuity commencement date is at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount on the annuity commencement date. The insurer shall compute the present value by using the mortality table, if any, and the guaranteed or assumed interest rates that are used in calculating the annuity payments.

H. For variable annuity contracts that provide cash surrender benefits, at any time before the annuity commencement date the cash surrender benefit shall not be less than the minimum nonforfeiture amount next computed after the company receives the request for surrender. The death benefit under the contracts shall be at least equal to the cash surrender benefit.

I. A variable annuity contract that does not provide cash surrender benefits or that does not provide death benefits that are at least equal to the minimum nonforfeiture amount before the annuity commencement date shall prominently state in the contract that these benefits are not provided.

J. Notwithstanding the requirements of this section, a variable annuity contract may provide that the company may cancel the annuity and pay the contract holder its accumulated value and that on the payment of its accumulated value the company is released from any further obligation under the contract if either:

1. At the time the annuity becomes payable the accumulated value is less than two thousand dollars, or would provide an income the initial amount of which is less than twenty dollars per month.

2. Before the annuity becomes payable under a periodic payment variable annuity contract, considerations have not been received under the contract for the two full years preceding the cancellation and both:

(a) The considerations were paid before the annuity became payable and were reduced to reflect any partial withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract.

(b) The accumulated value amounted to less than two thousand dollars.

K. For a variable annuity contract that provides within the same contract by rider or supplemental contract provision both annuity benefits and life insurance benefits that are in excess of the greater of the cash surrender benefits or a return of the gross considerations with interest, the minimum nonforfeiture benefits shall be equal to the sum of the minimum nonforfeiture benefits for the annuity portion and the minimum nonforfeiture benefits, if any, for the life insurance portion computed as if each portion were a separate contract. Notwithstanding subsection D of this section, in ascertaining the minimum nonforfeiture amounts and paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits that may be required by this section, the insurer shall disregard any additional benefits that are payable in the event of a total and permanent disability, as reversionary annuity or deferred reversionary annuity benefits or as other policy benefits in addition to life insurance, endowment and annuity benefits, and the considerations for all of the additional benefits. The inclusion of the additional benefits is not required in any paid-up benefits, unless the additional benefits separately would require minimum nonforfeiture amounts and paid-up annuity, cash surrender and death benefits.

L. For the purposes of this section, "consumer price index" means the index for all urban consumers for all items that is published by the bureau of labor statistics of the United States department of labor or its successor.

#### Section 20-2803. Emergency services access; prior authorization; requirements

A. A health care services plan shall provide coverage for an initial medical screening examination and any immediately necessary stabilizing treatment required by the emergency medical treatment and active labor act (P.L. 99-272; 100 Stat. 164; 42 United States Code section 1395dd) without prior authorization by the plan, subject to applicable copayments, coinsurance and deductibles.

B. A health care services plan shall provide coverage for emergency ambulance services without prior authorization, subject to applicable copayment, coinsurance and deductibles.

C. A provider shall not deny, limit or otherwise restrict a patient's access to medically necessary emergency services based on the patient's enrollment in a health care services plan.

D. A health care services plan may require as a condition of coverage prior authorization for health care services arising after the initial medical screening examination and immediately necessary stabilizing treatment. Prior authorization is granted unless denied or direction of the enrollee's care is initiated by the plan within a reasonable period of time after the plan receives the prior authorization request. If direction of care instructions are received from the plan after more than a reasonable period of time has elapsed, the treating provider or providers shall comply with the late instructions to the extent feasible, except that a health care services plan remains responsible for coverage of medically necessary care given and substantially completed before the late instructions were received.

E. A health care services plan that requires prior authorization under subsection C shall provide twenty-four hour access by telephone or facsimile for enrollees and providers to request prior authorization for medically necessary care after the initial medical screening examination and any immediately necessary stabilizing treatment. Plan personnel shall have access to a physician when necessary to make determinations regarding prior authorization.

F. A health care services plan that gives prior authorization for specific care by a provider shall not rescind or modify the authorization after the provider renders the authorized care in good faith and pursuant to the authorization.

G. A hospital emergency department shall make reasonable efforts to promptly contact the health care services plan for prior authorization for continuing treatment, specialty consultations, transfer arrangements or other appropriate care for an enrollee. A health care services plan shall not deny coverage for emergency services provided to the plan's enrollee due to a provider's failure to obtain prior authorization from the plan if the provider could not determine the patient's enrollment in a particular plan due to the patient's physical condition, or if the patient's enrollment information was not available from the plan at the time of the provider's contact.

H. If the health care services plan and the provider disagree on the medical necessity of specific emergency services for an enrollee, except for emergency services provided outside the geographic service area of the plan, medical personnel representing the plan shall make necessary arrangements to assume the care of the enrollee within a reasonable period of time after the disagreement arises. If the health care services plan fails to assume the care of the enrollee as provided by this subsection, the plan shall not deny coverage for medically necessary emergency services provided to the enrollee due to lack of prior authorization.

I. If within a reasonable period of time after receiving a request from a hospital emergency department for a specialty consultation a health care services plan fails to identify an appropriate specialist who is available and willing to assume the care of the enrollee, the emergency department may arrange for medically necessary emergency services by any appropriate specialist, and the plan shall not deny coverage for these services due to lack of prior authorization. A health care services plan shall not require prior authorization for specialty care emergency services for treatment of any immediately life threatening medical condition.

#### Section 20-2804. Utilization review; medically necessary emergency services

A. A health care services plan engaging in utilization review to determine whether any emergency services rendered by a provider were medically necessary and in accordance with this chapter shall consider the following factors:

1. Current emergency medical literature and standards of care.

2. Clinical information reasonably available to the provider at the time of the services.

B. A health care services plan shall not deny a claim for emergency services on the basis that the services were not medically necessary without review by a physician of the plan's choosing.

C. For the purpose of claims payment and utilization review of emergency services, a health care services plan shall have the right to require as a condition of payment that each treating provider produce all of the following:

1. Copies of all medical records pertaining to the emergency services provided to the enrollee.

2. Copies of records pertaining to any prior authorization and specialty consultation requests made by the provider.

3. A detailed and itemized billing statement.

D. If a health care services plan pays any portion of a provider's claim for services rendered to an enrollee, the plan shall not be permitted to recover all or part of that payment from the enrollee, except for:

1. The cost of an initial medical screening examination and related charges where the examination determined that emergency services were not medically necessary.

2. Payments made as a result of misrepresentation, fraud or clerical error.

3. Copayment, coinsurance or deductible amounts that are the responsibility of the enrollee.

The form shall be made available on the department's website.

C. Within fifteen days after receipt of a request for arbitration, the department shall do one of the following:

1. Determine that the surprise out-of-network bill qualifies for arbitration under this article and notify the enrollee, health insurer and health care provider that the request qualifies.

The court shall decide the matter, including any interpretation of statute or rule, without deference to any previous determination that may have been made on the question by the department.

E. In an effort to settle the surprise out-of-network bill before arbitration, the department shall arrange an informal settlement teleconference within thirty days after the department sends the notices required by this section.Â  The department is not a party to and may not participate in the informal settlement teleconference. As part of the settlement teleconference the health insurer shall provide to the parties the enrollee's cost sharing requirements under the enrollee's health plan based on the adjudicated claim. The insurer shall notify the department whether the informal settlement teleconference resulted in settlement of the disputed surprise out-of-network bill and, if settlement was reached, notify the department of the terms of the settlement within seven days.

F. If after proper notice from the department or contracted entity either the health insurer or health care provider or the provider's representative fails to participate in the teleconference, the other party may notify the department to immediately initiate arbitration and the nonparticipating party shall be required to pay the total cost of the arbitration.

G. On receipt of notice that the dispute has not settled or that a party has failed to participate in the teleconference, the department shall appoint an arbitrator and shall notify the parties of the arbitration and the appointed arbitrator. The department's notice shall specify whether one party is responsible for the total cost of the arbitration pursuant to subsection F of this section.Â  The health insurer and health care provider must agree on the arbitrator and may mutually agree to use an arbitrator who is not on the department's list. If either the health insurer or health care provider objects to the arbitrator, and the parties are unable to agree on a mutually acceptable alternative arbitrator, the department or contracted entity shall randomly assign three arbitrators. The health insurer and the health care provider shall each strike one arbitrator, and the last arbitrator shall conduct the arbitration unless there are two arbitrators remaining, in which case the department or contracted entity shall randomly assign the arbitrator.

H. Before the arbitration:

D. The director may issue subpoenas, administer oaths and examine under oath any person as to any matter pertinent to the examination.Â  If a person fails or refuses to obey a subpoena, the director may petition a court of competent jurisdiction and, on proper showing, the court may enter an order compelling the witness to appear and testify or produce documentary evidence.

E. When making an examination under this chapter, the director may retain attorneys, appraisers, independent actuaries, independent certified public accountants or other professionals and specialists as examiners, the reasonable cost of which shall be borne by the licensee that is the subject of the examination.

F. The provisions of this section do not limit the director's authority to terminate or suspend an examination in order to pursue other legal or regulatory action pursuant to the insurance laws of this state. Findings of fact and conclusions made pursuant to any examination constitute prima facie evidence in any legal or regulatory action.

G. The provisions of this section do not limit the director's authority to use and, if appropriate, make public any final or preliminary examination report, any examiner or licensee work papers or other documents or any other information discovered or developed during the course of any examination in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action that the director deems appropriate.

M. All examination and examination related expenses shall be borne by the provider and shall be paid by the insurance examiners' revolving fund pursuant to section 20-159.

 

#### Section 20-3208. Conflict of interest; examiners

A. The director may not appoint an examiner if the examiner, either directly or indirectly, has a conflict of interest or is affiliated with the management of or owns a pecuniary interest in any person subject to examination under this chapter.Â  This section does not automatically preclude an examiner from being an owner, an insured in a life settlement contract or insurance policy or a beneficiary in an insurance policy that is proposed for a life settlement contract.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A, the director may retain on an individual basis qualified actuaries, certified public accountants or other similar individuals who are independently practicing their professions even though these persons may from time to time be similarly employed or retained by persons subject to examination under this chapter.

#### Section 20-3210. Annual statements; record retention

A. Each licensed provider shall file with the director on or before March 1 of each year an annual statement in a form prescribed by the director.Â  The annual statement shall be verified by the oath of at least two of its principal officers, showing its condition at the end of the preceding calendar year.Â  In addition to any other requirements, the annual statement shall include the total number, aggregate face amount and life settlement proceeds of policies settled during the immediately preceding calendar year, together with a breakdown of the information by policy issue year. The annual statement shall not include individual transaction data regarding the business of life settlements or information that there is a reasonable basis to believe could be used to identify the owner or the insured.

B. The provider shall maintain records of all consummated transactions and life settlement contracts for three years after the death of the insured. The director may inspect these records during reasonable business hours.

 

#### Section 20-3211. Contract requirements; execution; rescission; definition

A. A provider entering into a life settlement contract with any owner of a policy in which the insured is terminally ill shall first obtain the following:

1. If the owner is the insured, a written statement from a licensed attending physician that the owner is of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence to enter into a settlement contract.

2. A document in which the insured consents to the release of the insured's medical records to a provider, settlement broker or insurance producer and, if the policy was issued less than two years from the date of application for a settlement contract, to the insurance company that issued the policy.

B. The insurer shall respond to a request for verification of coverage submitted by a provider, settlement broker or life insurance producer not later than thirty calendar days from the date the request is received.Â  The request for verification of coverage must be made on a form approved by the director.Â  The insurer shall complete and issue the verification of coverage or indicate in which respects it is unable to respond. In the insurer's response, the insurer shall indicate whether, based on the medical evidence and documents provided, the insurer intends to pursue an investigation at this time regarding the validity of the insurance contract.

C. Before or at the time of execution of the settlement contract, the provider shall obtain a witnessed document in which the owner consents to the settlement contract, represents that the owner has a full and complete understanding of the settlement contract and a full and complete understanding of the benefits of the policy, acknowledges that the owner is entering into the settlement contract freely and voluntarily and, for persons with a chronic illness or terminal illness or condition, acknowledges that the insured has a chronic illness or a terminal illness or condition and that the chronic illness or the terminal illness or condition was diagnosed after the policy was issued.

D. The insurer shall not unreasonably delay effecting change of ownership or beneficiary with any life settlement contract lawfully entered into in this state or with a resident of this state.

E. If a life settlement broker or life insurance producer performs any of these activities required of the provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.

F. If a broker performs the verification of coverage activities required of the provider, the provider is deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of this section.

G. Within twenty days after an owner executes the life settlement contract, the provider shall give written notice to the insurer that issued the insurance policy that the policy is subject to a life settlement contract. The notice shall be accompanied by the documents required by section 20-3204, subsection C.

H. All medical information solicited or obtained by any licensee is subject to any applicable law relating to confidentiality of medical information.

I. All life settlement contracts entered into in this state shall provide that the owner may rescind the contract on or before fifteen days after the date it is executed by all parties and the owner has received all required disclosures.Â  Rescission, if exercised by the owner, is effective only if both notice of the rescission is given and the owner repays all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest paid on account of the provider within the rescission period. If the insured dies during the rescission period, the contract shall be deemed to have been rescinded subject to repayment by the owner or the owner's estate of all proceeds and any premiums, loans and loan interest to the provider.

J. Within three business days after receipt from the owner of documents to effect the transfer of the insurance policy, the provider shall pay the proceeds of the settlement to an escrow or trust account managed by a trustee or escrow agent in a state or federally chartered financial institution pending acknowledgment of the transfer by the issuer of the policy.Â  The trustee or escrow agent shall transfer the proceeds due to the owner within three business days after acknowledgment of the transfer from the insurer.

K. Failure to tender the life settlement contract proceeds to the owner by the date disclosed to the owner renders the contract voidable by the owner for lack of consideration until the time the proceeds are tendered to and accepted by the owner.Â  The failure to give written notice of the right of rescission tolls the right of rescission until thirty days after the written notice of the right of rescission has been given.

L. Any fee paid by a provider, party, individual or owner to a broker in exchange for services provided to the owner pertaining to a life settlement contract shall be computed as a percentage of the offer obtained and not the face value of the policy. This section does not prohibit a broker from reducing the broker's fee below this percentage if the broker so chooses.

M. The broker shall disclose to the owner anything of value paid or given to a broker that relates to a life settlement contract.

N. At any time before or at the time of the application for or issuance of a policy or during a two-year period commencing with the date of issuance of the policy, a person shall not enter into a life settlement regardless of the date the compensation is to be provided and regardless of the date the assignment, transfer, sale, devise, bequest or surrender of the policy is to occur. This prohibition does not apply if:

1. The owner certifies to the provider that the policy was issued on the owner's exercise of conversion rights arising out of a group or individual policy if the total of the time covered under the conversion policy plus the time covered under the prior policy is at least twenty-four months. The time covered under a group policy must be calculated without regard to a change in insurance carriers if the coverage has been continuous and under the same group sponsorship.

2. The owner submits independent evidence to the provider that one or more of the following conditions have been met within the two-year period:

(a) The owner or insured is terminally ill.

(b) The owner or insured disposes of ownership interests in a closely held corporation pursuant to the terms of a buyout or other similar agreement in effect at the time the insurance policy was initially issued.

(c) The owner's spouse dies.

(d) The owner divorces the owner's spouse.

(e) The owner retires from full-time employment.

(f) The owner becomes a person with a physical or mental disability and a physician determines that the disability prevents the owner from maintaining full-time employment.

(g) On the application of a creditor of the owner, a court of competent jurisdiction enters a final order, judgment or decree adjudicating the owner bankrupt or insolvent, or approving a petition seeking reorganization of the owner or appointing a receiver, trustee or liquidator to all or a substantial part of the owner's assets.

O. The provider shall submit copies of the independent evidence required by subsection N, paragraph 2 of this section when the provider submits a request to the insurer for verification of coverage. The copies shall be accompanied by a letter of attestation from the provider that the copies are true and correct copies of the documents received by the provider. This section does not prohibit an insurer from exercising its right to contest the validity of any policy.

P. If the provider submits to the insurer a copy of independent evidence as provided in subsection N, paragraph 2, subdivision (a) of this section when the provider submits a request to the insurer to effect the transfer of the policy to the provider, the copy shall be deemed to establish that the settlement contract satisfies the requirements of this section.

Q. An insurer shall not:

1. Engage in any transaction, act or practice that restricts, limits or impairs the lawful transfer of ownership, change of beneficiary or assignment of a policy.

2. Make any false or misleading statement for the purpose of dissuading an owner or insured from a lawful life settlement contract.

R. If there is more than one owner on a single policy and the owners are residents of different states, the life settlement contract shall be governed by the law of the state in which the owner having the largest percentage ownership resides or, if the owners hold equal ownership, the state of residence of one owner agreed on in writing by all of the owners of the policy. The law of the state of the insured shall govern in the event that equal owners fail to agree in writing on a state of residence for jurisdictional purposes.

S. A provider from this state who enters into a life settlement contract with an owner who is a resident of another state that has enacted statutes or adopted rules governing life settlement contracts shall be governed in the effectuation of that life settlement contract by the statutes and rules of the owner's state of residence.Â  If the state in which the owner is a resident has not enacted statutes or rules governing life settlement contracts, the provider shall give the owner notice that neither state regulates the transaction on which the owner is entering.Â  For transactions in those states, the provider shall maintain all records required if the transactions were executed in the state of residence. The forms used in those states need not be approved by the department.

T. If there is a conflict in the laws that apply to an owner and a purchaser in any individual transaction, the laws of the state that apply to the owner shall take precedence and the provider shall comply with those laws.

U. It is a fraudulent life settlement act and a violation of this chapter for any person to do any of the following or any of the acts listed in subsection X of this section:

1. Enter into a life settlement contract if a person knows or reasonably should have known that the life insurance policy was obtained by means of a false, deceptive or misleading application for the policy.

2. Engage in any transaction, practice or course of business if a person knows or reasonably should have known that the intent was to avoid the notice requirements of this section.

3. Engage in any fraudulent act or practice in connection with any transaction relating to any settlement involving an owner who is a resident of this state.

4. Fail to provide the disclosures or file the required reports with the director as required by this chapter.

5. Issue, solicit or market the purchase of a new life insurance policy for the sole purpose of, or with a primary emphasis on, settling the policy.

6. With respect to any settlement contract or insurance policy and a broker, knowingly solicit an offer from, effectuate a life settlement contract with or make a sale to any provider, financing entity or related provider trust that is controlling, controlled by or under common control with a broker, unless the relationship has been fully disclosed to the owner.

7. With respect to any life settlement contract or insurance policy and a provider, knowingly enter into a life settlement contract with an owner if, in connection with a life settlement contract, anything of value will be paid to a broker that is controlling, controlled by or under common control with a provider or the financing entity or related provider trust that is involved in a settlement contract, unless the relationship has been fully disclosed to the owner.

8. With respect to a provider, enter into a life settlement contract unless the life settlement promotional, advertising and marketing materials, have been filed with the director as may be prescribed by rule. The marketing materials shall not expressly reference that the insurance is free for any period of time.Â  The inclusion of any reference in the marketing materials that would cause an owner to reasonably believe that the insurance is free for any period of time is a violation of this chapter.

9. With respect to any life insurance producer, insurance company, broker or provider, make any statement or representation to the applicant or policyholder in connection with the sale or financing of a life insurance policy to the effect that the insurance is free or without cost to the policyholder for any period of time unless provided in the policy.

V. Life settlement contracts and applications for life settlement contracts, regardless of the form of transmission, shall contain the following statement or a substantially similar statement:

Any person who knowingly presents false information in an application for insurance or for a life settlement contract may be subject to criminal or civil liability.

W. The lack of a statement as required by subsection V of this section does not constitute a defense in any prosecution for a fraudulent life settlement act.

X. For the purposes of this section, "fraudulent life settlement act" includes all of the following:

1. Acts or omissions committed by any person who, for the purpose of depriving another of property or for pecuniary gain, commits or permits his employees or agents to engage in acts, including the following:

(a) Presenting, causing to be presented or preparing with knowledge and belief that it will be presented to or by a provider, premium finance lender, broker, insurer or insurance producer or any other person, false material information, or concealing material information as part of, in support of or concerning a fact material to one or more of the following:

(c) Entering into any intentional practice or plan that involves stranger originated life insurance as prescribed in section 20-443.02.

(e) If providing premium financing, receiving any proceeds, fees or other consideration from the policy or owner of the policy that are in addition to the amounts required to pay principal, interest and any costs or expenses incurred by the lender or borrower in connection with the premium finance agreement, except for a default, unless the default on such a loan or transfer of the policy occurs pursuant to an agreement or understanding with any other person for the purpose of evading regulation under this chapter.Â  Any payments, charges, fees or other amounts received by a person providing premium financing in violation of this subdivision shall be remitted to the original owner of the policy or to the original owner's estate if the original owner is not living at the time of the determination of overpayment.

2. If a person does any of the following or permits the person's employees or agents to do any of the following, in the furtherance of a fraud or to prevent the detection of a fraud:

(f) Enter into, broker or otherwise deal in a life settlement contract that was obtained by presenting false information concerning any fact material to the policy or by concealing, for the purpose of misleading another, information requested concerning any fact material to the policy where the owner or the owner's agent intended to defraud the policy's issuer.

(g) Attempt to commit, assist, aid or abet in the commission of, or conspiracy to commit the acts or omissions specified in this paragraph.

To receive and review in an expeditious manner advertisement relating to long-term care insurance products for which uniform standards have been adopted by the commission, and give approval to all advertisement that satisfies the applicable uniform standard.Â  For any product covered under this compact, other than long-term care insurance products, the commission shall have the authority to require an insurer to submit all or any part of its advertisement with respect to that product for review or approval before use if the commission determines that the nature of the product is such that an advertisement of the product could have the capacity or tendency to mislead the public.Â  The actions of the commission as provided in this section shall have the force and effect of law and shall be binding in the compacting states to the extent and in the manner provided in the compact.

Article VII

Rules and Operating Procedures, Rulemaking Functions

and Opting Out of Uniform Standards

A. The commission shall adopt reasonable rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this compact. If the commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this compact, the action by the commission shall be invalid and have no force and effect.

B. Rules and operating procedures shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that conforms to the model state administrative procedure act of 1981 as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the commission.Â  Before the commission adopts a uniform standard, the commission shall give written notice to the relevant state legislative committees in each compacting state responsible for insurance issues of its intention to adopt the uniform standard.Â  The commission in adopting a uniform standard shall consider fully all submitted materials and issue a concise explanation of its decision.

C. A uniform standard shall become effective ninety days after its adoption by the commission or such later date as the commission may determine. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard as provided in this article. "Opt out" means any action by a compacting state to decline to adopt or participate in an adopted uniform standard.Â  All other rules and operating procedures, and amendments thereto, shall become effective as of the date specified in each rule, operating procedure or amendment.

D. A compacting state may opt out of a uniform standard, either by legislation or rule adopted by the insurance department under the compacting state's administrative procedure act. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard by rule, it must:

1. Give written notice to the commission no later than ten business days after the uniform standard is adopted, or at the time the state becomes a compacting state.

2. Find that the uniform standard does not provide reasonable protections to the citizens of the state, given the conditions in the state.

E. The commissioner shall make specific findings of fact and conclusions of law, based on a preponderance of the evidence, detailing the conditions in the state that warrant a departure from the uniform standard and determining that the uniform standard would not reasonably protect the citizens of the state. The commissioner must consider and balance the following factors and find that the conditions in the state and needs of the citizens of the state outweigh both:

1. The intent of the legislature to participate in, and the benefits of, an interstate agreement to establish national uniform consumer protections for the products subject to this compact.

2. The presumption that a uniform standard adopted by the commission provides reasonable protections to consumers of the relevant product.

F. A compacting state, at the time of its enactment of the compact, may prospectively opt out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products by expressly providing for such opt out in the enacted compact, and such an opt out shall not be treated as a material variance in the offer or acceptance of any state to participate in the compact.Â  Such an opt out shall be effective at the time of enactment of the compact by the compacting state and shall apply to all existing uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products and those subsequently adopted.Â  Pursuant to this subsection, this state opts out of all uniform standards involving long-term care insurance products.

G. If a compacting state elects to opt out of a uniform standard, the uniform standard shall remain applicable in the compacting state electing to opt out until the opt out legislation is enacted into law or the regulation opting out becomes effective. Once the opt out of a uniform standard by a compacting state becomes effective as provided under the laws of that state, the uniform standard shall have no further force and effect in that state unless and until the legislation or regulation implementing the opt out is repealed or otherwise becomes ineffective under the laws of that state. Â If a compacting state opts out of a uniform standard after the uniform standard has been made effective in that state, the opt out shall have the same prospective effect as provided under article XIV of this compact for withdrawals.

H. If a compacting state has formally initiated the process of opting out of a uniform standard by regulation, and while the regulatory opt out is pending, the compacting state may petition the commission, at least fifteen days before the effective date of the uniform standard, to stay the effectiveness of the uniform standard in that state. The commission may grant a stay if it determines the regulatory opt out is being pursued in a reasonable manner and there is a likelihood of success.Â  If a stay is granted or extended by the commission, the stay or extension thereof may postpone the effective date by up to ninety days, unless affirmatively extended by the commission.Â  However, a stay may not be permitted to remain in effect for more than one year unless the compacting state can show extraordinary circumstances that warrant a continuance of the stay, including, the existence of a legal challenge that prevents the compacting state from opting out. A stay may be terminated by the commission on notice that the rulemaking process has been terminated.

I. Not later than thirty days after a rule or operating procedure is adopted, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule or operating procedure.Â  However, the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule or operating procedure from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule or operating procedure to be unlawful if the rule or operating procedure represents a reasonable exercise of the commission's authority.

Article VIII

Commission Records and Enforcement

A. The commission shall adopt rules establishing conditions and procedures for public inspection and copying of its information and official records, except information and records involving the privacy of individuals and insurers' trade secrets. The commission may adopt additional rules under which it may make available to federal and state agencies, including law enforcement agencies, records and information otherwise exempt from disclosure, and may enter into agreements with such agencies to receive or exchange information or records subject to nondisclosure and confidentiality provisions.

B. Except as to privileged records, data and information, the laws of any compacting state pertaining to confidentiality or nondisclosure shall not relieve any compacting state commissioner of the duty to disclose any relevant records, data or information to the commission. Disclosure to the commission does not waive or otherwise affect any confidentiality requirement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this compact, the commission shall not be subject to the compacting state's laws pertaining to confidentiality and nondisclosure with respect to records, data and information in its possession. Confidential information of the commission shall remain confidential after the information is provided to any commissioner.

C. The commission shall monitor compacting states for compliance with duly adopted bylaws, rules, including uniform standards, and operating procedures. The commission shall notify any noncomplying compacting state in writing of its noncompliance with commission bylaws, rules or operating procedures. If a noncomplying compacting state fails to remedy its noncompliance within the time specified in the notice of noncompliance, the compacting state shall be deemed to be in default as set forth in article XIV of this compact.

D. The commissioner of any state in which an insurer is authorized to do business, or is conducting the business of insurance, shall continue to exercise the commissioner's authority to oversee the market regulation of the activities of the insurer in accordance with the provisions of the state's law. The commissioner's enforcement of compliance with the compact is governed by the following provisions:

1. With respect to the commissioner's market regulation of a product or advertisement that is approved or certified to the commission, the content of the product or advertisement shall not constitute a violation of the provisions, standards or requirements of the compact except on a final order of the commission, issued at the request of a commissioner after prior notice to the insurer and an opportunity for hearing before the commission.

2. Before a commissioner may bring an action for violation of any provision, standard or requirement of the compact relating to the content of an advertisement not approved or certified to the commission, the commission, or an authorized commission officer or employee, must authorize the action.Â  Authorization under this paragraph does not require notice to the insurer, opportunity for hearing or disclosure of requests for authorization or records of the commission's action on such requests.

Article IX

Dispute Resolution

On the request of a member, the commission shall attempt to resolve any disputes or other issues that are subject to this compact and that may arise between two or more compacting states, or between compacting states and noncompacting states, and the commission shall adopt an operating procedure providing for resolution of such disputes.

Article X

Product Filing and Approval

A. Insurers and third-party filers seeking to have a product approved by the commission shall file the product with, and pay applicable filing fees to, the commission.Â  This compact does not restrict or otherwise prevent an insurer from filing its product with the insurance department in any state wherein the insurer is licensed to conduct the business of insurance, and such filing shall be subject to the laws of the states where filed.

B. The commission shall establish appropriate filing and review processes and procedures pursuant to commission rules and operating procedures.Â  The commission shall adopt rules to establish conditions and procedures under which the commission will provide public access to product filing information. In establishing such rules, the commission shall consider the interests of the public in having access to such information, as well as protection of personal medical and financial information and trade secrets, that may be contained in a product filing or supporting information.

C. Any product approved by the commission may be sold or otherwise issued in those compacting states for which the insurer is legally authorized to do business.

Article XI

Review of Commission Decisions Regarding Filings

A. Not later than thirty days after the commission has given notice of a disapproved product or advertisement filed with the commission, the insurer or third-party filer whose filing was disapproved may appeal the determination to a review panel appointed by the commission.Â  The commission shall adopt rules to establish procedures for appointing the review panels and provide for notice and hearing.Â  An allegation that the commission, in disapproving a product or advertisement filed with the commission, acted arbitrarily, capriciously or in a manner that is an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with the law, is subject to judicial review in accordance with article III, subsection D of this compact.

B. The commission shall have authority to monitor, review and reconsider products and advertisement subsequent to their filing or approval on a finding that the product does not meet the relevant uniform standard. Where appropriate, the commission may withdraw or modify its approval after proper notice and hearing, subject to the appeal process in subsection A of this article.

Article XII

Finance

A. The commission shall pay or provide for the payment of the reasonable expenses of its establishment and organization. To fund the cost of its initial operations, the commission may accept contributions and other forms of funding from the national association of insurance commissioners, compacting states and other sources. Contributions and other forms of funding from other sources shall be of such a nature that the independence of the commission concerning the performance of its duties shall not be compromised.

B. The commission shall collect a filing fee from each insurer and third-party filer filing a product with the commission to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the commission and its staff in a total amount sufficient to cover the commission's annual budget.

C. The commission's budget for a fiscal year shall not be approved until it has been subject to notice and comment as set forth in article VII of this compact.

The internal financial accounts of the commission shall be subject to the accounting procedures established under its bylaws. The financial accounts and reports including the system of internal controls and procedures of the commission shall be audited annually by an independent certified public accountant. On the determination of the commission, but no less frequently than every three years, the review of the independent auditor shall include a management and performance audit of the commission. The commission shall make an annual report to the governor and legislature of the compacting states, which shall include a report of the independent audit. The commission's internal accounts shall not be confidential and such materials may be shared with the commissioner of any compacting state on request.Â  Any work papers related to any internal or independent audit and any information regarding the privacy of individuals and insurers' proprietary information, including trade secrets, shall remain confidential.

G. A compacting state does not have any claim to or ownership of any property held by or vested in the commission or to any commission funds held under this compact.

Article XIII

Compacting States, Effective Date and Amendment

B. The compact shall become effective and binding on legislative enactment of the compact into law by two compacting states. The commission shall become effective for purposes of adopting uniform standards for, reviewing and giving approval or disapproval of products filed with the commission that satisfy applicable uniform standards only after twenty-six states are compacting states or, alternatively, by states representing greater than forty percent of the premium volume for life insurance, annuity, disability income and long-term care insurance products, based on records of the national association of insurance commissioners for the prior year. Thereafter, it shall become effective and binding as to any other compacting state on enactment of the compact into law by that state.

C. Amendments to the compact may be proposed by the commission for enactment by the compacting states. An amendment does not become effective and binding on the commission and the compacting states unless and until all compacting states enact the amendment into law.

B. The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repealing statute.Â  The withdrawal shall not apply to any product filings approved or self-certified, or any advertisement of such products, on the date the repealing statute becomes effective, except by mutual agreement of the commission and the withdrawing state unless the approval is rescinded by the withdrawing state as provided in subsection E of this article.

C. The commissioner of the withdrawing state shall immediately notify the management committee in writing on the introduction of legislation repealing the compact in the withdrawing state.

The director may obtain insurance compliance audit documents at any time.Â  The director may use the insurance compliance audit documents in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as part of the director's duties.Â  The insurer shall comply with any compliance dates set by the director with respect to the insurance compliance audit. Notwithstanding any other law, the director shall provide an insurer with copies of all documents that the director believes support a violation of this title or that justify any regulatory or other action against the insurer.Â  A disclosure pursuant to this paragraph is not a waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the disclosed documents.

6. In order to facilitate identification, audit documents produced as a result of an insurance compliance audit shall be labeled "compliance report: privileged document".

7. A person who conducts or participates in the preparation of an insurance compliance audit and who has observed physical events may testify regarding those events, but may not be compelled to testify or produce documents related to any privileged part of the insurance compliance audit or any insurance compliance audit document.

(a) The privilege is asserted for a fraudulent purpose.

(b) The document is not subject to the privilege.

(c) The privileged document shows evidence of noncompliance with applicable state or federal laws, rules, regulations or orders of the department and the insurer, person or entity fails to undertake corrective action or eliminate the noncompliance within the compliance date set by the director.

F. Within sixty days after an insurer is served a written request by certified mail for disclosure of an insurance compliance audit document, the insurer may file with the appropriate court a petition requesting a hearing on whether the insurance compliance audit document or portions of the document are privileged under this section or subject to disclosure. The court shall conduct an in camera review of the insurance compliance audit document and shall determine whether all or a portion of the insurance compliance audit document is privileged or subject to disclosure.Â  The insurer's failure to file a petition for a hearing does not waive the privilege in connection with any other request for disclosure of the insurance compliance audit document.

On making this determination, the court may only compel the disclosure of those portions of an insurance compliance audit document that are relevant to issues in dispute in the underlying proceeding.Â  Any compelled disclosure will not be considered to be a public document or be deemed to be a waiver of the privilege for any other civil or administrative proceeding.

H. At any time, the parties to a civil or administrative proceeding other than a regulatory or legal action brought as a part of the director's duties may stipulate to entry of an order directing that specific information contained in an insurance compliance audit document is or is not subject to the privilege provided under subsection A of this section. The stipulation may be limited to the instant proceeding and, absent specific language to the contrary, is not applicable to any other proceeding.

I. This section or the release of any insurance compliance audit document under this section does not limit, waive or abrogate the scope or nature of any statutory or common law privilege including the work product doctrine, the attorney-client privilege or the subsequent remedial measures exclusion.

J. This article does not limit the director's authority under sections 20-156, 20-157, 20-157.01, 20-160 and 20-466.

#### Section 20-3502. Compliance with federal law; report

A. Each health care insurer that issues a health plan in this state shall comply with the mental health parity and addiction equity act.

B. After January 1, 2022, on a date specified by the director, each health care insurer that issues a health plan in this state shall submit a report to the department for each fully insured product network type the health care insurer issues. If the health care insurer determines that the information to be reported varies by network or plan, or varies in the individual, small group or large group market, the health care insurer must submit a report for each variation. Each report must do the following:

1. Describe the process that is used to develop or select the medical necessity criteria for mental health and substance use disorder benefits and the process used to develop or select the medical necessity criteria for medical and surgical benefits.

2. Identify all nonquantitative treatment limits that are applied to mental health and substance use disorder benefits and all nonquantitative treatment limits that are applied to medical and surgical benefits within each classification of benefits.

3. Demonstrate through analysis that for any nonquantitative treatment limit applied to mental health and substance use disorder benefits in a classification of benefits, as written and in operation, any process, strategy, evidentiary standard or other factor used in applying the nonquantitative treatment limit to mental health and substance use disorder benefits in the classification are comparable to, and applied not more stringently than, any process, strategy, evidentiary standard or other factor used in applying the treatment limit for medical and surgical benefits in the classification.

C. In addition to analyzing the reports prescribed in subsection B of this section, the department shall also evaluate health plan compliance with the standards related to financial requirements and quantitative treatment limits described in this section. The department shall perform this analysis during its review of required health care insurer form filings, but may also require a health care insurer to submit additional data relating to its methods for complying with financial requirements and quantitative treatment limit standards. The department may collect and analyze data for each health care insurer's large group plans through a separate, consolidated report.

D. The health plan may not apply any financial requirement or quantitative treatment limit to mental health and substance use disorder benefits in any classification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative treatment limit of that type applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits in the same classification, unless the requirement or treatment limit is modified by one of the following exceptions:

1. Multitiered prescription drug benefits. If a health plan applies different levels of financial requirements to different tiers of prescription drug benefits that are based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the requirements for nonquantitative treatment limits and without regard to whether a drug is generally prescribed with respect to medical and surgical benefits or with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits, the health plan satisfies the parity requirements of this section with respect to prescription drug benefits.Â  For the purposes of this paragraph, "reasonable factors" include cost, efficacy, generic versus brand name and mail order versus pharmacy pick up.

2. Multiple network tiers. If a health plan provides benefits through multiple tiers of in-network providers, including an in-network tier of preferred providers with more generous cost sharing to participants than a separate in-network tier of participating providers, the health plan may divide its benefits provided on an in-network basis into subclassifications that reflect network tiers, if the tiering is based on reasonable factors determined in accordance with the requirements for nonquantitative treatment limits and without regard to whether a provider provides services with respect to medical and surgical benefits or mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any subclassification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or treatment limit that applies to substantially all medical and surgical benefits in the subclassification.

3. Subclassifications allowed for office visits that are separate from other outpatient services. For the purposes of applying the financial requirements and treatment limits prescribed by this section, a health plan may divide its benefits provided on an outpatient basis into the two subclassifications described in this paragraph. After the subclassifications are established, the health plan or health care insurer may not impose any financial requirement or quantitative treatment limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits in any subclassification that is more restrictive than the predominant financial requirement or quantitative treatment limit that applies to substantially all medical and surgical benefits in the subclassification.Â  Subclassifications for generalists and specialists are prohibited.Â  Only the following two subclassifications are allowed under this paragraph:

(a) Office and physician visits.

(b) All other outpatient items and services, including outpatient surgery, facility charges for day treatment centers, laboratory charges or other similar medical items.

E. A health insurer shall file the report required by subsection B of this section once every three years. Â In years in which the report required by subsection B of this section is not required to be filed, the health care insurer shall file a summary of changes made to the medical necessity criteria and nonquantitative treatment limits and a written attestation that specifies that the health care insurer is in compliance with the mental health parity and addiction equity act.Â  The department may require the health care insurer to respond to additional questions that are related to the summary of changes or to supply additional data to verify compliance. Three years after the health care insurer submits an original report required by subsection B of this section or an updated or refiled report described in this subsection, the health care insurer may either:

1. File an updated report.

2. Resubmit the health care insurer's currently filed report if the health care insurer files a written attestation to the department that specifies that there have been no changes.

F. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if a health care insurer provided the information required by this section in an existing filing or report, the department may not require the health care insurer to submit any additional filing or report. The department is not prohibited from otherwise requesting information or data that is necessary to verify compliance with the mental health parity and addiction equity act or this chapter. The department shall analyze the information required by this section that the health care insurer previously submitted in an existing filing or report to determine compliance with the report required by this section.Â  The department may establish by rule the terms regarding any required resubmittal of information.

G. All documents, reports or other materials provided to the director pursuant to this section are confidential and are not subject to disclosure. Section 20-157.01, subsection B applies to this section.

C. On or before January 1, 2023, the department shall post to the web page prescribed in subsection B of this section an aggregated summary of its analysis of the reports filed by health care insurers pursuant to section 20-3502, subsection B, including any conclusions regarding industry compliance with the mental health parity and addiction equity act.Â  The department may not post any information that:

2. Enables a person to determine the identity of a health care insurer.

D. Beginning in 2022, the department shall include in its annual report a summary of all stakeholder outreach and regulatory activity related to the implementation, oversight and enforcement of the mental health parity and addiction equity act and the requirements of this chapter.

#### Section 20-3504. Access to behavioral health services for minors

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, any health care insurer that issues a health plan in this state that includes mental health or substance use disorder benefits may not deny any claim for mental health or substance use disorder benefits for a minor solely on grounds that the mental health or substance use disorder service was provided in a school or other educational setting or ordered by a court if the service was provided by an in-network provider or by an out-of-network provider only as allowed by the health plan that covers the subscriber, enrollee or insured.

B. This section does not require a health care insurer to approve a claim or provide reimbursement for a mental health or substance use disorder service provided by an out-of-network provider except as allowed by the health plan that covers the subscriber, enrollee or insured.

C. A health care insurer may require that any mental health or substance use disorder service offered by a mental health provider in an educational setting be provided in a facility or location that is appropriate for the type of service provided and in a manner that complies with applicable laws governing the provision of health care services, including privacy and parental consent laws.

D. Claims for covered mental health or substance use disorder services that are provided by an out-of-network provider and that are not covered by the subscriber's, enrollee's or insured's health plan solely because the provider is an out-of-network provider shall be paid from the children's behavioral health services fund established by section 36-3436.

#### Section 20-3505. Mental health parity advisory committee; members

A person may not offer, solicit or negotiate travel insurance or travel protection plans on an individual or group basis by using a negative or opt out option that requires a consumer to take an affirmative action to deselect coverage, such as unchecking a box on an electronic form, when the consumer purchases a trip.

I. It is an unfair trade practice to market blanket travel insurance coverage as free.

J. If a consumer's destination jurisdiction requires insurance coverage, it is not an unfair trade practice to require that a consumer choose between the following options as a condition of purchasing a trip or travel package:

1. Purchasing the coverage required by the destination jurisdiction through the travel retailer or limited lines travel insurance producer supplying the trip or travel package.

2. Agreeing to obtain and provide proof of coverage that meets the destination jurisdiction's requirements before departure.

K. For the purposes of this section, "delivery" means handing fulfillment materials to the policyholder or certificate holder or sending fulfillment materials by postal mail or electronic means to the policyholder or certificate holder.

2. Holds a valid managing general agent license in this state.

B. A travel administrator and its employees are exempt from the licensing requirements of chapter 2, article 3.2 of this title for travel insurance it administers.

C. An insurer that underwrites travel insurance is responsible for the acts of the travel administrator administering that travel insurance, ensuring that the travel administrator maintains all books and records relevant to the insurer and ensuring that the travel administrator makes the books and records available to the director on request.

#### Section 20-3558. Travel insurance classification and filing

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, travel insurance is classified and filed for purposes of rates and forms under an inland marine line of insurance, except that travel insurance that provides coverage for sickness, accident, disability or death occurring during travel, either exclusively or in conjunction with related coverages of emergency evacuation or repatriation of remains, may be filed under either an accident and health line of insurance or an inland marine line of insurance.

B. Travel insurance may be in the form of an individual, group or blanket policy.

C. Eligibility and underwriting standards for travel insurance may be developed and provided based on travel protection plans that are designed for individual or identified marketing or distribution channels, if those standards also meet this state's underwriting standards for inland marine.

#### Section 20-3602. Credit allowed a domestic ceding insurer; definition

A. A domestic ceding insurer shall be allowed a credit for reinsurance as either an asset or a reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets the requirements of subsection C, D, E, F, G, H or M of this section. The director may adopt rules pursuant to section 20-3604 that specify additional requirements relating to or setting forth any of the following:

1. The valuation of assets or reserve credits.

2. The amount and forms of security supporting reinsurance arrangements described in section 20-3603, subsection B.

3. The circumstances pursuant to which credit will be reduced or eliminated.

B. Credit shall be allowed under subsection C, D or E of this section only for cessions of those kinds or classes of business that the assuming insurer is licensed or otherwise allowed to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. Credit shall be allowed under subsection E or F of this section only if the applicable requirements of subsection N have been satisfied.

C. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state.

D. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is accredited by the director as a reinsurer in this state. To be eligible for accreditation, a reinsurer shall do all of the following:

1. File with the director evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction.

2. Submit to this state's authority to examine its books and records.

3. Be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, be entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state.

4. File annually with the director a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement.

5. Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director that it has adequate financial capacity to meet its reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of its application if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders of at least $20,000,000 and its accreditation has not been denied by the director within ninety days after submission of its application.

E. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that is domiciled in or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, is entered through a state that employs standards regarding credit for reinsurance substantially similar to those applicable under this article and the assuming insurer or United States branch of an alien assuming insurer does both of the following:

1. Maintains a surplus as regards policyholders of at least $20,000,000. This requirement does not apply to reinsurance ceded and assumed pursuant to pooling arrangements among insurers in the same holding company system.

2. Submits to the authority of this state to examine its books and records.

F. The following apply when credit is allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund for the payment of claims:

1. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution as defined in section 20-3601, subsection B for the payment of the valid claims of its United States ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. To enable the director to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund, the assuming insurer shall report annually to the director information that is substantially the same as the information licensed insurers are required to report on the national association of insurance commissioners annual statement form. The assuming insurer shall submit to examination of its books and records by the director and bear the expense of examination.

2. Credit for reinsurance may not be granted under this subsection unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by either:

(a) The insurance commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled.

(b) The insurance commissioner of another state who, pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust.

3. The form of the trust and any trust amendments also shall be filed with the insurance commissioner of every state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable on the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States.Â  The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in its trustees for the benefit of the assuming insurer's United States ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. The trust and the assuming insurer shall be subject to examination as determined by the director.

4. The trust shall remain in effect for as long as the assuming insurer has outstanding obligations due under the reinsurance agreements subject to the trust. Not later than February 28 of each year, the trustee of the trust shall report to the director in writing the balance of the trust and listing the trust's investments at the preceding year end and shall certify the date of termination of the trust, if so planned, or certify that the trust will not expire before the following December 31.

5. The following requirements apply to the following categories of assuming insurer:

(a) The trust fund for a single assuming insurer shall consist of monies in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers, and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of at least $20,000,000, except as provided in subdivision (b) of this paragraph.

(b) At any time after the assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three full years, the insurance commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency.Â  The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount that is less than thirty percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers covered by the trust.

(c) In the case of a group, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, all of the following apply:

(i) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception, amendment or renewal date on or after January 1, 1993, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount that is not less than the respective underwriters' several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any underwriter of the group.

(ii) For reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before December 31, 1992, and not amended or renewed after that date, notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the trust shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States.

(iii) In addition to the trusts described in items (i) and (ii) of this subdivision, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 shall be held jointly for the benefit of the United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account.

(iv) The incorporated members of the group may not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.

(v) Within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the director an annual certification by the group's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member, or if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the group.

(d) In the case of a group of incorporated underwriters under common administration, the group shall meet the following requirements:

(i) Have continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately before making application for accreditation.

(ii) Maintain aggregate policyholders' surplus of at least $10,000,000,000.

(iii) Maintain a trust fund in an amount not less than the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group.

(iv) Maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which $100,000,000 shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for these liabilities.

(v) Within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, make available to the director an annual certification of each underwriter member's solvency by the member's domiciliary regulator and financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by its independent public accountant.

G. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer that has been certified by the director as a reinsurer in this state and that secures its obligations in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, and all of the following apply:

1. To be eligible for certification, the assuming insurer shall meet the following requirements:

(a) The assuming insurer must be domiciled and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in a qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the director pursuant to paragraph 3 of this subsection.

(b) The assuming insurer must maintain minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, in an amount to be determined by the director pursuant to rule.

(c) The assuming insurer must maintain financial strength ratings from two or more rating agencies deemed acceptable by the director pursuant to rule.

(d) The assuming insurer must agree to submit to the jurisdiction of this state, must appoint the director as its agent for service of process in this state and must agree to provide security for one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers if it resists enforcement of a final United States judgment.

(e) The assuming insurer must agree to meet applicable information filing requirements as determined by the director, both with respect to an initial application for certification and on an ongoing basis.

(f) The assuming insurer must satisfy any other requirements for certification deemed relevant by the director.

2. An association that includes incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters may be a certified reinsurer.Â  To be eligible for certification, in addition to satisfying the requirements prescribed in paragraph 1 of this subsection:

(a) The association shall satisfy its minimum capital and surplus requirements through the capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, of the association and its members, which shall include a joint central fund that may be applied to any unsatisfied obligation of the association or any of its members, in an amount determined by the director to provide adequate protection.

(b) The incorporated members of the association may not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the association and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the association's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members.

(c) Within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the association's domiciliary regulator, the association shall provide to the director an annual certification by the association's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the association.

3. The director shall create and publish a list of qualified jurisdictions under which an assuming insurer that is licensed and domiciled in a qualified jurisdiction is eligible to be considered for certification by the director as a certified reinsurer, and all of the following apply:

(a) To determine whether the domiciliary jurisdiction of a non-United States assuming insurer is eligible to be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction, the director shall evaluate the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reinsurance supervisory system of the jurisdiction, both initially and on an ongoing basis, and consider the rights, the benefits and the extent of reciprocal recognition afforded by the non-United States jurisdiction to reinsurers licensed and domiciled in the United States. A qualified jurisdiction must agree to share information and cooperate with the director with respect to all certified reinsurers domiciled within that jurisdiction.Â  A jurisdiction may not be recognized as a qualified jurisdiction if the director has determined that the jurisdiction does not adequately and promptly enforce final United States judgments and arbitration awards. The director may consider additional factors.

(b) A list of qualified jurisdictions shall be published through the national association of insurance commissioners committee process.Â  The director shall consider this list in determining qualified jurisdictions.Â  If the director approves a jurisdiction as qualified that does not appear on the list of qualified jurisdictions, the director shall provide thoroughly documented justification in accordance with criteria to be developed under rule.

(c) United States jurisdictions that meet the requirement for accreditation under the national association of insurance commissioners financial standards and accreditation program shall be recognized as qualified jurisdictions.

(d) If a certified reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction ceases to be a qualified jurisdiction, the director may suspend the reinsurer's certification indefinitely, in lieu of revocation.

4. The director shall assign a rating to each certified reinsurer, giving due consideration to the financial strength ratings that have been assigned by rating agencies deemed acceptable to the director pursuant to rule. The director shall publish a list of all certified reinsurers and their ratings.

5. A certified reinsurer shall secure obligations assumed from United States ceding insurers under this subsection at a level that is consistent with its rating, as specified in rules adopted by the director, and all of the following apply:

(a) For a domestic ceding insurer to qualify for full financial statement credit for reinsurance ceded to a certified reinsurer, the certified reinsurer shall maintain security in a form that is acceptable to the director and that is consistent with section 20-3603, or in a multibeneficiary trust in accordance with subsection F of this section, except as otherwise provided in this subsection.

(b) If a certified reinsurer maintains a trust to fully secure its obligations subject to subsection F of this section and chooses to secure its obligations incurred as a certified reinsurer in the form of a multibeneficiary trust, the certified reinsurer shall maintain separate trust accounts for its obligations incurred under reinsurance agreements issued or renewed as a certified reinsurer with reduced security as allowed by this subsection or comparable laws of other United States jurisdictions and for its obligations subject to subsection F of this section.Â  It shall be a condition to the grant of certification under this subsection that the certified reinsurer shall have bound itself, by the language of the trust and agreement with the insurance commissioner with principal regulatory oversight of each such trust account, to fund, on termination of any such trust account, out of the remaining surplus of such trust any deficiency of any other such trust account.

(c) The minimum trusteed surplus requirements provided in subsection F of this section are not applicable with respect to a multibeneficiary trust maintained by a certified reinsurer for the purpose of securing obligations incurred under this subsection, except that such a trust shall maintain a minimum trusteed surplus of $10,000,000.

(d) With respect to obligations incurred by a certified reinsurer under this subsection, if the security is insufficient, the director shall reduce the allowable credit by an amount proportionate to the deficiency, and may impose further reductions in allowable credit on finding that there is a material risk that the certified reinsurer's obligations will not be paid in full when due.

(e) A certified reinsurer whose certification has been terminated for any reason shall be treated as a certified reinsurer required to secure one hundred percent of its obligations.Â  If the director continues to assign a higher rating as allowed by other provisions of this section, this requirement does not apply to a certified reinsurer in inactive status or to a reinsurer whose certification has been suspended.Â  For the purposes of this subdivision, "terminated" refers to revocation, suspension, voluntary surrender and inactive status.

6. If an applicant for certification has been certified as a reinsurer in a national association of insurance commissioners accredited jurisdiction, the director may defer to that jurisdiction's certification and to the rating assigned by that jurisdiction, and the assuming insurer shall be considered to be a certified reinsurer in this state.

7. To continue to qualify for a reduction in security for its in-force business, a certified reinsurer that ceases to assume new business in this state may request to maintain its certification in inactive status.Â  An inactive certified reinsurer shall continue to comply with all applicable requirements of this subsection, and the director shall assign a rating that takes into account, if relevant, the reasons why the reinsurer is not assuming new business.

H. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer meeting each of the following conditions:

1. The assuming insurer must have its head office or be domiciled in, as applicable, and be licensed in a reciprocal jurisdiction. A reciprocal jurisdiction is a jurisdiction that meets one of the following:

(a) A non-United States jurisdiction that is subject to an in-force covered agreement with the United States, each within its legal authority, or, in the case of a covered agreement between the United States and the European Union, that is a member state of the European Union.

(b) A United States jurisdiction that meets the requirements for accreditation under the national association of insurance commissioners financial standards and accreditation program.

(c) A qualified jurisdiction, as determined by the director pursuant to subsection G, paragraph 3 of this section that is not otherwise described in subdivision (a) or (b) of this paragraph and that meets certain additional requirements, consistent with the terms and conditions of in-force covered agreements, as specified by the director in rule.

2. The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus, or its equivalent, calculated according to the methodology of its domiciliary jurisdiction, in an amount to be prescribed in rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, minimum capital and surplus equivalents, net of liabilities, calculated according to the methodology applicable in its domiciliary jurisdiction and a central fund containing a balance in amounts to be prescribed in rule.

3. The assuming insurer must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio, as applicable, that is prescribed in rule. If the assuming insurer is an association, including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, it must have and maintain, on an ongoing basis, a minimum solvency or capital ratio in the reciprocal jurisdiction where the assuming insurer has its head office or is domiciled, as applicable, and is also licensed.

4. The assuming insurer must agree and provide adequate assurance to the director, in a form specified by the director pursuant to rule, as follows:

(a) The assuming insurer must provide a prompt written notice and explanation to the director if it falls below the minimum requirements prescribed in paragraph 2 or 3 of this subsection or if any regulatory action is taken against it for serious noncompliance with applicable law.

(b) The assuming insurer must consent in writing to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state and to the appointment of the director as agent for service of process. The director may require that consent for service of process be provided to the director and included in each reinsurance agreement. This subdivision does not limit, or in any way alter, the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, except to the extent such agreements are unenforceable under applicable insolvency or delinquency laws.

(c) The assuming insurer must consent in writing to pay all final judgments, wherever enforcement is sought, obtained by a ceding insurer or its legal successor, that have been declared enforceable in the jurisdiction where the judgment was obtained.

(d) Each reinsurance agreement must include a provision requiring the assuming insurer to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded pursuant to that agreement if the assuming insurer resists enforcement of a final judgment that is enforceable under the law of the jurisdiction in which it was obtained or a properly enforceable arbitration award, whether obtained by the ceding insurer or by its legal successor on behalf of its resolution estate.

(e) The assuming insurer must confirm that it is not presently participating in any solvent scheme of arrangement that involves this state's ceding insurers, and agree to notify the ceding insurer and the director and to provide security in an amount equal to one hundred percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities to the ceding insurer, should the assuming insurer enter into such a solvent scheme of arrangement. The security shall be in a form that is consistent with the requirements prescribed in subsection G of this section and section 20-3603 and as specified by the director in rule.

5. If requested by the director, the assuming insurer or its legal successor must provide on behalf of itself and any legal predecessors certain documentation to the director as specified by the director in rule.

6. The assuming insurer must maintain a practice of prompt payment of claims under reinsurance agreements, pursuant to criteria prescribed in rule.

7. The assuming insurer's supervisory authority must confirm to the director on an annual basis, as of the preceding December 31 or at the annual date otherwise statutorily reported to the reciprocal jurisdiction, that the assuming insurer complies with the requirements prescribed in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this subsection.

8. The assuming insurer may provide the director with additional information on a voluntary basis.

I. The director:

1. Shall timely create and publish a list of reciprocal jurisdictions that includes any reciprocal jurisdiction prescribed in subsection H, paragraph 1, subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section and shall consider including any other reciprocal jurisdiction included on the national association of insurance commissioners list of reciprocal jurisdictions published through the national association of insurance commissioners committee process. The director may approve a jurisdiction that does not appear on the national association of insurance commissioners list of reciprocal jurisdictions in accordance with criteria to be developed under rules issued by the director.

2. May remove a jurisdiction from the list of reciprocal jurisdictions on a determination that the jurisdiction no longer meets the requirements of a reciprocal jurisdiction, in accordance with a process prescribed in rules issued by the director, except that the director shall not remove from the list a reciprocal jurisdiction prescribed in subsection H, paragraph 1, subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section.Â  On removal of a reciprocal jurisdiction from the list, credit for reinsurance ceded to an assuming insurer that has its home office or is domiciled in that jurisdiction shall be allowed, if otherwise allowed by law.

3. Shall timely create and publish a list of assuming insurers that have satisfied the conditions prescribed in this section and to which cessions shall be granted credit in accordance with this section. The director may add an assuming insurer to the list if a national association of insurance commissioners accredited jurisdiction has added the assuming insurer to a list of such assuming insurers or if, on initial eligibility, the assuming insurer submits the information to the director as required under subsection H, paragraph 4 of this section and complies with any additional requirements that the director may impose by rule, except to the extent that they conflict with an applicable covered agreement.

4. May revoke or suspend the eligibility of an assuming insurer for recognition under this subsection in accordance with procedures prescribed in rule, if the director determines that the assuming insurer no longer meets one or more of the requirements under this section. While the assuming insurer's eligibility is suspended, a reinsurance agreement issued, amended or renewed after the effective date of the suspension does not qualify for credit except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with section 20-3603. If the assuming insurer's eligibility is revoked, credit for reinsurance may not be granted after the effective date of the revocation with respect to any reinsurance agreements entered into by the assuming insurer, including reinsurance agreements entered into before the date of revocation, except to the extent that the assuming insurer's obligations under the contract are secured in a form acceptable to the director and are consistent with the parameters prescribed in section 20-3603.

J. If subject to a legal process of rehabilitation, liquidation or conservation, as applicable, the ceding insurer, or its representative, may seek and, if determined appropriate by the court in which the proceedings are pending, may obtain an order requiring that the assuming insurer post security for all outstanding ceded liabilities.

K. Subsection H of this section does not:

1. Limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to a reinsurance agreement to agree on requirements for security or other terms in that reinsurance agreement, except as expressly prohibited by this article or another applicable law or rule.

2. Authorize an assuming insurer to withdraw or reduce the security provided under any reinsurance agreement except as allowed by the terms of the agreement.

3. Limit or in any way alter the capacity of parties to any reinsurance agreement to renegotiate the agreement.

L. Credit may be taken under subsection H of this section only for reinsurance agreements entered into, amended or renewed on or after September 29, 2021, and only with respect to losses incurred and reserves reported on or after the later of the date on which the assuming insurer has met all eligibility requirements pursuant to subsection H of this section and the effective date of the new reinsurance agreement, amendment or renewal. This subsection does not alter or impair a ceding insurer's right to take credit for reinsurance, to the extent that credit is not available under this section, as long as the reinsurance qualifies for credit under any other applicable provision of this article.

M. Credit shall be allowed when the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of subsection C, D, E, F, G or H of this section, but only as to the insurance of risks located in jurisdictions where the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction.

N. If the assuming insurer is not licensed, accredited or certified to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the credit allowed by subsections E and F of this section may not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements:

1. That if the assuming insurer fails to perform its obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, will submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, will comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction and will abide by the final decision of the court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal.Â  This subsection is not intended to conflict with or override the obligation of the parties to a reinsurance agreement to arbitrate their disputes, if this obligation is created in the agreement.

2. To designate the director or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney on whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding insurer.

O. If the assuming insurer does not meet the requirements prescribed in subsection C, D, E or H of this section, the credit allowed by subsection F or G of this section may not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the trust agreements to the following conditions:

1. Notwithstanding any other provisions in the trust instrument, if the trust fund is inadequate because it contains an amount that is less than the amount required by subsection F, paragraph 5 of this section, or if the grantor of the trust has been declared insolvent or placed into receivership, rehabilitation, liquidation or similar proceedings under the laws of its state or country of domicile, the trustee shall comply with an order of the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight over the trust or with an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directing the trustee to transfer to the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight all of the assets of the trust fund.

2. The assets shall be distributed by and claims shall be filed with and valued by the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight in accordance with the laws of the state in which the trust is domiciled that are applicable to the liquidation of domestic insurance companies.

3. If the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight determines that the assets of the trust fund or any part of the assets are not necessary to satisfy the claims of the United States ceding insurers of the grantor of the trust, the assets or part of the assets shall be returned by the insurance commissioner with regulatory oversight to the trustee for distribution in accordance with the trust agreement.

4. The grantor shall waive any right otherwise available to it under United States law that is inconsistent with this subsection.

P. If an accredited or certified reinsurer ceases to meet the requirements for accreditation or certification, the director may suspend or revoke the reinsurer's accreditation or certification, and the following apply:

1. The director must give the reinsurer notice and an opportunity for a hearing. The suspension or revocation may not take effect until after the director's order on the hearing, unless either:

(a) The reinsurer waives its right to a hearing.

(b) The director's order is based on regulatory action by the reinsurer's domiciliary jurisdiction or the voluntary surrender or termination of the reinsurer's eligibility to transact insurance or reinsurance business in its domiciliary jurisdiction or in the primary certifying state of the reinsurer under subsection G, paragraph 6 of this section.

(c) The director finds that an emergency requires immediate action and a court of competent jurisdiction has not stayed the director's action.

2. While a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is suspended, a reinsurance contract issued or renewed after the effective date of the suspension does not qualify for credit except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with section 20-3603. If a reinsurer's accreditation or certification is revoked, a credit for reinsurance may not be granted after the effective date of the revocation except to the extent that the reinsurer's obligations under the contract are secured in accordance with subsection G, paragraph 5 of this section or section 20-3603.

Q. A ceding insurer shall take steps to:

1. Manage its reinsurance recoverables proportionate to its own book of business. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the director within thirty days after reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, exceed fifty percent of the domestic ceding insurer's last reported surplus to policyholders, or after it is determined that reinsurance recoverables from any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, are likely to exceed this limit. The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.

2. A ceding insurer shall take steps to diversify its reinsurance program. A domestic ceding insurer shall notify the director within thirty days after ceding to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, more than twenty percent of the ceding insurer's gross written premium in the prior calendar year, or after it has determined that the reinsurance ceded to any single assuming insurer, or group of affiliated assuming insurers, is likely to exceed this limit.Â  The notification shall demonstrate that the exposure is safely managed by the domestic ceding insurer.

R. For the purposes of this section, "covered agreement" means an agreement that is entered into pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform and consumer protection act (31 United States Code sections 313 and 314), that is currently in effect or in a period of provisional application and that addresses the elimination, under specified conditions, of collateral requirements as a condition for entering into any reinsurance agreement with a ceding insurer domiciled in this state or for allowing the ceding insurer to recognize credit for reinsurance.

A health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent may use its existing medical exceptions process to satisfy this requirement if that process is consistent with the requirements prescribed in section 20-3653 and this section.Â  The process shall be made easily accessible on the health care insurer's, health benefit plan's, pharmacy benefit manager's or utilization review agent's website and shall include a list of the information and documentation the health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent requires and where and to whom the patient and prescribing provider must send the step therapy exception request.

B. A step therapy exception request shall be granted if sufficient justification and any necessary supporting clinical documentation are submitted to establish that any of the following applies:

1. The prescription drug required by the step therapy protocol is contraindicated or will likely cause a serious adverse reaction by or physical or mental harm to the patient.

2. The prescription drug required by the step therapy protocol is expected to be ineffective based on the known clinical characteristics of the patient and the known characteristics of the prescription drug regimen.

The patient has tried the prescription drug required by the step therapy protocol while under the patient's current or previous health care plan, or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class with a similar efficacy and side effect profile or with the same mechanism of action, the patient's adherence during the trial was for a period of time sufficient to allow for a positive treatment outcome and the prescription drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness, an adverse event or contraindication.

4. The prescription drug required by the step therapy protocol is not in the best interest of the patient based on medical necessity because the patient's use of the prescription drug is expected to cause any of the following:

E. An insured, enrollee or subscriber may appeal an adverse step therapy exception determination as prescribed in chapter 15, article 2 of this title.

F. This section does not prevent either of the following:

1. A health care insurer, pharmacy benefit manager or utilization review agent from requiring a patient to try an AB-rated generic equivalent before providing coverage for the equivalent branded prescription drug.
