## Chapter 5 - WILDLIFE VIOLATOR COMPACT

### Article 1 - Adoption

#### Section 17-501. Short title

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as "the wildlife violator compact".

#### Section 17-502. Adoption and text of compact

The wildlife violator compact is adopted and enacted into law as follows:

Article 1

Findings, declaration of policy and purpose

(a) The participating states find that:

(1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective states for the benefit of all residents and visitors.

(2) The protection of the wildlife resources of a state is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances and administrative rules relating to the management of such resources.

(3) The preservation, protection, management and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational and economic aspects of such natural resources.

(4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries; therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management and restoration laws, ordinances, and administrative rules and regulations of the participating states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap or possess wildlife.

(5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property.

(6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states.

(7) In some states, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than his home state:

(i) Is required to post collateral or a bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; or

(ii) Is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or

(iii) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance.

(8) The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in paragraph (7) of this article is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the cited person who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the citation, could return to his home state and disregard his duty under the terms of the citation.

(9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in his home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately continue on his way after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.

(10) The practices described in paragraph (7) of this article cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial or pay a fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is made.

(11) The enforcement practices described in paragraph (7) of this article consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.

(b) It is the policy of the participating states to:

(1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states.

(2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a participating state and treat such suspension as if it had occurred in their state provided the violation which resulted in the suspension could have been the basis for suspension in their state.

(3) Allow a violator, except as provided in paragraph (b) of article III, to accept a wildlife citation and, without delay, proceed on his way, whether or not a resident of the state in which the citation was issued, provided that the violator's home state is party to this compact.

(4) Report to the appropriate participating state, as provided in the compact manual, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state.

(5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded against its residents, which convictions occurred in a participating state, as though they had occurred in the home state.

(6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the participating states for enforcing compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one participating state to a resident of another participating state.

(7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information.

(8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations.

(c) The purpose of this compact is to:

(1) Provide a means through which a participating state may join in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in paragraph (b) of this article in a uniform and orderly manner.

(2) Provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within participating states in recognition of the violator's right to due process and the sovereign status of a participating state.

Ranges that are located at least one mile from areas that are zoned for residences, schools, hotels, motels, hospitals or churches are exempt from this subsection.

C. Any person, at the person's expense, may measure the noise emitted from an outdoor shooting range pursuant to subsection E.

D. The noise emitted from an outdoor shooting range shall not exceed an Leq(h) of sixty-four DBA.

E. In measuring the noise emitted from an outdoor shooting range:

1. If a range performs the measurement of noise pursuant to subsection B, sound pressure measurements shall be taken twenty feet from the nearest occupied residence, school, hotel, motel, hospital or church, or from the nearest proposed location of a residence, school, hotel, motel, hospital or church if the property is zoned for such a structure but is currently unimproved.  If a person performs the measurement of noise pursuant to subsection C, sound pressure measurements shall be taken twenty feet from the person's residence, school, hotel, motel, hospital or church, or twenty feet from the proposed location of the person's residence, school, hotel, motel, hospital or church if the property is zoned for such a structure but is currently unimproved.

2. Sound pressure measurements shall be made in a location directly between the range and the nearest existing or proposed residence, school, hotel, motel, hospital or church.  If there are natural or artificial obstructions that prevent an accurate noise measurement, the measurement may be taken within an additional twenty feet radius from the initial measurement location.

3. Sound pressure measurements shall be made on the A-weighted fast response mode scale.  Measurements shall be taken during the noisiest hour of peak use during the operation of the range. Measurements shall be taken according to American national standards institute's standard methods ANSI S1.2-1962 (R1976) American national standard method for physical measurement of sound and ANSI S1.2-1971 (R1976) American national standard method for measuring sound pressure levels. Measurements shall be taken using a type 1 sound meter meeting the requirements of ANSI S1.4L-1971.  Any part of the measurements conducted on a range shall comply with the range safety rules.

F. Outdoor shooting ranges in operation on July 1, 2002 shall comply with the provisions of this section before July 1, 2003. Ranges not in operation on July 1, 2002 shall comply with the provisions of this section when they begin operation.

2. "DBA" means A-weighted decibels, taking into account human response to sound energy in different frequency bands.

3. "Decibel" means the unit of measure for sound pressure denoting the ratio between two quantities that are proportional to power. The number of decibels is ten times the base ten logarithm of this ratio.

4. "Leq(h)" means the equivalent energy level that is the steady state level that contains the same amount of sound energy as a time varying sound level for a sixty minute time period.

 

#### Section 17-603. Preexisting outdoor shooting ranges; noise buffering or attenuation

A. If an outdoor shooting range was constructed before July 1, 2002 in compliance with existing applicable county or municipal ordinances and zoning requirements and if property located within one mile of the exterior property boundary of the range is rezoned after July 1, 2002 for residential use or any other use that includes a school, hotel, motel, hospital or church, the zoning authority must provide for noise buffers or attenuation devices that are either:

1. Within the new development as a condition for developing the property or as supplied by the zoning authority.

2. Supplied or funded by the zoning authority for location in the range.

B. Property owners, developers, zoning authorities and ranges may negotiate and provide for noise buffers or attenuation devices located on or off the range.

C. Any noise buffering or attenuation under this section must comply with the state noise standards prescribed by section 17-602.
