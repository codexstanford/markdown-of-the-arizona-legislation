If monies are not available to pay warrants, checks or substitute checks, or electronic funds transfer vouchers of the department of administration presented to the state treasurer pursuant to section 35-185, the treasurer, in lieu of payment, shall issue and shall exchange or sell a treasurer's warrant note or notes in the amount or amounts equal to the sum of the face value of the warrants, checks or substitute checks, or electronic funds transfer vouchers presented for payment.Â  Treasurer's warrant notes shall be issued in lieu of payment of state general fund warrants, checks or substitute checks, or electronic funds transfer vouchers only or in exchange for previously issued treasurer's warrant notes. Before issuing warrant notes, the state treasurer is not required to divest from program funding obligations issued pursuant to section 41-5857, board funding obligations issued pursuant to section 28-7678, monies in the budget stabilization fund or operating monies invested in securities that are earning a rate of interest greater than the cost of issuing warrant notes. For the purposes of this subsection, "monies are not available" means an operating cash balance is not available to pay warrants, checks or substitute checks, or electronic funds transfer vouchers except for those operating monies invested in program funding obligations issued pursuant to section 41-5857, board funding obligations issued pursuant to section 28-7678, monies in the budget stabilization fund or operating monies invested in securities that are earning a rate of interest greater than the total cost of issuing any warrant notes.

B. The face value of a treasurer's warrant note may be equal to the sum of any combination of warrants, checks or substitute checks, and electronic funds transfer vouchers presented for payment. The treasurer may sell warrant notes at public or private sale and shall use the proceeds of the sale to pay warrants, checks or substitute checks, and electronic funds transfer vouchers previously presented pursuant to section 35-185. Treasurer's warrant notes shall not be sold at a price below their face value.

C. Each treasurer's warrant note sold or exchanged shall be dated the date the respective warrants are presented for payment. If the date of delivery of a treasurer's warrant note that is sold is later than the date of presentment of the respective warrant or warrants, the purchaser of the treasurer's warrant note shall pay the accrued interest as an additional purchase price. The accrued interest shall be paid to the holder of the respective unpaid warrant or warrants, which shall be deemed to bear interest at the same rate as the respective treasurer's warrant note from presentment to payment from the proceeds of warrant notes sold.

D. The treasurer shall establish a maturity date for each treasurer's warrant note of not longer than ninety days from the date of initial issue. The treasurer may specify that treasurer's warrant notes may be called for redemption at any time before the specified maturity date.

E. The treasurer shall pay interest from the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund on the face value of each warrant note at the rate established by the state treasurer at the time of issuing the warrant note. Interest shall be paid from the date of the treasurer's warrant note until the maturity date or redemption date. The treasurer shall establish the interest rate before the exchange or sale of warrant notes at a rate of not more than the maximum rate permitted by the state loan commissioners.

F. The state loan commissioners, at a meeting called and chaired by the state treasurer, shall fix or change the maximum rate of interest that may be paid on warrant notes. Any change of the maximum allowable rate of interest as established by the state loan commissioners shall not affect warrant notes issued before the date of the change.

G. Each treasurer's warrant note shall be signed by the treasurer or the treasurer's designated agent and countersigned by the director of the department of administration or the director's designated agent. The required signatures may be electronic signatures.Â  All treasurer's warrant notes shall be substantially in the following form:

Phoenix, Arizona _________________, 20__

On _________, 20__, the treasurer of the state of Arizona will pay to the order of _______________ at ___________________ $_____________ with interest at _______ per annum from the date of issuance until paid (calculated on a 365/366 day basis).

(insert early redemption provisions)

 

____________________________ ____________________________

(Countersigned) Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   State Treasurer  

Director of the department

of administration

H. Treasurer's warrant notes may be exchanged or sold for the combined face value of any number of treasurer's warrant notes previously issued.Â  Except for those treasurer's warrant notes issued in exchange for or to redeem treasurer's warrant notes previously issued, treasurer's warrant notes may not be issued, exchanged or sold except in payment of or to provide monies to pay warrants, checks or substitute checks, and electronic funds transfer vouchers presented for payment as provided in section 35-185.

I. Treasurer's warrant notes issued in any fiscal year shall be numbered consecutively beginning with the number one. Treasurer's warrant notes shall be redeemed in numerical order. If the treasurer has sufficient monies to pay only a portion of the lowest numbered outstanding warrant note, the treasurer may deposit the monies with the paying agent pursuant to subsection K of this section or call in the lowest numbered warrant note, before maturity according to its terms, and pay the bearer the amount available and issue to the bearer a new warrant note bearing a number that will preserve, for the new warrant note, the priority of the partially paid warrant note and bearing a value equal to the amount of principal and interest remaining unpaid. The new warrant note and the partial payment of principal and interest on the partially paid warrant note shall be exchanged for the partially paid warrant note. The new warrant note shall pay interest at the same rate as the partially paid warrant note. The treasurer may make the changes in the form and date of the new warrant note as necessary to reflect the amount of unpaid interest on the partially paid warrant note.

J. The treasurer may include in the form of the treasurer's warrant notes provisions regarding the redemption and payment of treasurer's warrant notes before maturity as are consistent with subsections I and K of this section and section 35-185.02. If prior redemption is to be a provision of a treasurer's warrant note, the note shall provide a method to notify the holder of the note by publication or written, telegraphic or electronic means as chosen by the treasurer.

K. The treasurer may appoint a paying agent to facilitate the redemption and payment of treasurer's warrant notes. Monies deposited with the paying agent shall be allocated to pay the principal of, interest on and any prior redemption premiums associated with treasurer's warrant notes in numerical order. A treasurer's warrant note is deemed paid for all purposes of this section and section 35-185.02 when there is deposited with the paying agent sufficient monies to pay all amounts when due on the treasurer's warrant note and all amounts when due on all outstanding treasurer's warrant notes bearing a lower number. A paying agent appointed pursuant to this subsection shall provide security deposits as required by the treasurer.

L. When the treasurer or the paying agent, if payment is made to a paying agent, pursuant to subsection K of this section, pays treasurer's warrant notes or when the warrant notes are redeemed, the treasurer or paying agent shall mark on the face of the treasurer's warrant notes the word "cancelled" or shall cancel the warrant notes by electronic means indicating the date of cancellation and shall promptly present the notes to the director of the department of administration who shall give the state treasurer a receipt therefor.

M. If the state loan commissioners determine that it will result in a lower net effective interest rate on one, some or all warrant notes to be issued by the treasurer during the current fiscal year, the commissioners may authorize the treasurer to purchase letters of credit and to incur and pay insurance premiums, attorney fees or other related costs incurred with respect to treasurer's warrant notes. All such payments shall be treated in the same manner as interest to be paid on treasurer's warrant notes and shall be paid from the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund.

N. If treasurer's warrant notes are to be exchanged for warrants, checks or substitute checks, or electronic funds transfer vouchers held by banks or savings and loan associations, the treasurer may enter into agreements with such banks or savings and loan associations to provide for the issuance, reissuance and custody of treasurer's warrant notes, the fixing of the interest rates on the treasurer's warrant notes and the method of giving notice to the holders of the notes. Such agreements may provide for a book entry system for the treasurer's warrant notes or may provide for the issuance of one note with an appropriate grid on the reverse, which shall show the advancements made by the banks or savings and loan associations and also the payments of interest and reductions of principal. Such agreements may be continuing in nature, may be executed at any time and may apply to any treasurer's warrant notes exchanged for either warrants, checks or substitute checks, or electronic funds transfer vouchers or treasurer's warrant notes at any time during the remainder of the fiscal year in which the agreement is made. The agreements shall provide a method to preserve the priority of, interest rate on and other terms of each treasurer's warrant note exchanged pursuant to the agreement. Any such agreement shall not become effective until approved by the state loan commissioners.

#### Section 35-185.02. Treasurer's warrant note redemption fund; receipt; appropriation

A. The treasurer's warrant note redemption fund is established. Any time treasurer's warrant notes are issued and remain outstanding, all monies that would otherwise be paid into the state general fund, except for amounts sufficient to pay the salaries of constitutional officers of this state, shall be deposited in the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund. All monies in the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund shall be used exclusively to pay the principal of and interest on treasurer's warrant notes, and to pay the fees and charges authorized by this chapter. Monies in the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund shall be invested by the state treasurer, or a paying agent appointed pursuant to section 35-185.01, subsection K, and shall be credited to the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund.

B. If all warrant notes have been redeemed and the principal of and interest on such warrant notes have been paid along with any fees and charges authorized by this chapter, the paying agent shall return all unused and unneeded monies to the treasurer and the treasurer shall transfer any remaining amounts in the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund to the state general fund.

C. All monies deposited in the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund are appropriated to the state treasurer to pay the principal of and interest on outstanding treasurer's warrant notes and to pay any fees and charges authorized by this chapter. The amount appropriated to the treasurer pursuant to this subsection constitutes a continuing appropriation and shall not exceed the sum of the face values of the treasurer's warrant notes issued plus an additional one-fifth of that sum for paying interest on the treasurer's warrant notes and fees and charges authorized by this chapter. The state treasurer, if authorized by the state loan commission, may provide for the payment of a premium on redemption and payment of warrant notes before the maturity date established at the time of issuance.

D. The presentation on or after the maturity date or earlier call date of a treasurer's warrant note shall constitute full and sufficient authority for the state treasurer or a paying agent appointed pursuant to section 35-185.01, subsection K to disburse public monies from the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund in the amount stated on the face of the treasurer's warrant note plus any interest and prior redemption premiums, if applicable, when due.

E. All amounts deposited in the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund are pledged and held in trust for the benefit of the holders of the treasurer's warrant notes for the exclusive payment of the principal of and interest on outstanding treasurer's warrant notes and the payment of the fees and charges authorized by this chapter. All monies so pledged and received by the treasurer to be placed in the treasurer's warrant note redemption fund are immediately deemed assigned to and held in trust, without notice or recording of any nature whatsoever, for the holders of outstanding treasurer's warrant notes and other persons to be paid as provided by this article.

#### Section 35-186. Duplicate warrants or checks; notice; bond; form and effect

A. If it appears to the satisfaction of the department of administration, by affidavit or otherwise, that any warrant or check has been lost or destroyed before payment and there is no reasonable probability of its being found or presented or that a warrant or check has not been presented for payment within the time specified on the face of the warrant or check, the department of administration may issue to the owner a duplicate of the lost, destroyed or out-of-date warrant or check. Before issuing the duplicate, the department of administration shall send a written stop payment notice to the state treasurer giving the number, amount and date of the lost, destroyed or out-of-date warrant or check, the payee and the fund on which drawn.

B. The director of the department of administration shall establish procedures for issuing duplicate warrants or checks that protect this state and provide the owner with a duplicate warrant or check within a reasonable time.

Any warrant, check or substitute check that includes federal, trust or donated monies held for the payment of void warrants or checks shall be transferred or reverted to the fund from which it was drawn.Â  All other monies held for the payment of void warrants, checks or substitute checks are deemed property presumed abandoned under section 44-302, subsection A, paragraph 11 and shall be transmitted to the department of revenue each month. For the purposes of this section and title 44, chapter 3, a warrant, check or substitute check does not include a state-issued check for support as defined in section 25-500 or for spousal maintenance.

#### Section 35-188. Allowance of set-off against state; audit of claim

In all actions brought on behalf of the state, no debt shall be allowed against the state as a set-off unless it has been exhibited to the director of the department of administration and by him allowed or disallowed. A debt may be allowed as a set-off when it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the defendant, at the time of trial, is in possession of vouchers which he could not produce to the department of administration, or that he was prevented from exhibiting the claim to the department of administration by absence from the state, sickness or unavoidable accident.

#### Section 35-189. Issuance of certificate for claim for which no appropriation made

F. The governing body may employ registrars and transfer and paying agents to administer the bonds.

1. If sold by public sale before the sale of any bonds the governing body or board shall meet and enter on its record an order directing the sale of the bonds and the date and hour of the sale, and cause a copy of the order to be published at least once a week for two successive weeks in cities having a population of fifteen thousand or more persons, and once a week for four successive weeks in all other political subdivisions before the sale in one or more designated daily or weekly newspapers, together with a notice that sealed proposals will be received for purchase of the bonds on the date and hour named in the order.

2. If sold through an online bidding process, bids for the bonds that are entered into the system may be concealed until a specified time or disclosed in the online bidding process, may be subject to improvement in favor of the political subdivision before a specified time and may be for an entire issue of bonds or specified maturities according to the manner, terms and notice provisions ordered by the governing body.

B. If the bonds are sold by public sale or through an online bidding process, all proposals shall be received on the date and hour or in the manner stated in the order and the governing body or board shall award the bonds to the highest and most responsible bidder. The successful bidder shall provide a bid guarantee for not less than two percent of the total par value of the bonds within twenty-four hours after the date and time the bid is awarded. The bid guarantee may be in the form of a certified check or a bond issued by a surety company licensed by the department of insurance and financial institutions to do business in this state.Â  The governing body or board may reject any and all bids.Â  If the successful bidder does not carry out the terms of the proposal to purchase the bonds, the bid guarantee shall be forfeited as stipulated and liquidated damages.

E. Any net premium used as provided in subsection D, paragraph 3 of this section shall be amortized for all debt limitation purposes on a pro rata basis each year by multiplying the net premium used by a percentage equal to the percentage of the total principal amount of the bond issue that matures in that year.

F. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Net premium" means the difference between the par amount of the bond issue and the bond issue price determined pursuant to United States treasury regulations.

2. "Online bidding process" means a procurement process in which the governing body receives bids electronically over the internet in a real-time, competitive bidding event.

#### Section 35-458. Levy of tax for payment of bonds; security

A. After the bonds are issued, the governing body or board shall enter on its minutes a record of the bonds sold and their numbers and dates, and shall annually levy and cause to be collected a tax, at the same time and in the same manner as other taxes are levied and collected on all taxable property in the political subdivision, sufficient to pay the annual interest on the bonds when due, and shall likewise annually levy a tax sufficient to redeem the bonds when they mature. The annual levy shall not exceed the net amount necessary to meet annual payments of principal and interest, projected payments of principal and interest on new debt planned for the ensuing year, a reasonable delinquency factor, including an amount necessary to correct prior year errors or shortages in the levy, if applicable, and any expenses and fees required in conjunction with the authorization pursuant to section 35-512. The levy shall be the net of all cash in excess of ten percent of the annual payments of principal and interest in the current fiscal year from the previous year remaining in the fund or funds prescribed by subsection B of this section.

B. Monies derived from the levy of the tax when collected shall constitute a fund for payment of interest and the bonds. The fund shall be kept separately and shall be known as the "interest fund" and "redemption fund", or the two funds may be combined into a single "interest and redemption fund".

C. All bonds, heretofore and hereafter issued, are secured by a lien on all revenues received pursuant to the tax levy. The lien arises automatically without the need for any action or authorization by the political subdivision or the political subdivision's governing body or board. The lien is valid and binding from the time of the issuance of the bonds.Â  The revenues received pursuant to the levy of the tax are immediately subject to the lien. The lien attaches immediately to the revenues and is effective, binding and enforceable against the political subdivision, the political subdivision's successors, transferees and creditors and all other parties asserting rights in the revenues, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the lien, without the need for any physical delivery, recordation, filing or further act.

 

#### Section 35-458.01. Commercial paper; variable rate bonds; compound interest bonds; bonds subject to tender

A. Bonds issued by a city or town may bear interest at any rate or rates not in excess of the maximum voted rate, payable at the times determined by the governing body, provided that each such bond may be evidenced by one instrument, or if commercial paper by a succession of instruments each bearing interest payable only at maturity. Bonds issued under this section shall be subject to the following:

1. The bonds may bear interest at a fixed or variable rate or any combination thereof, none of which exceeds the maximum voted rate.

2. A variable rate shall be based on any objective measure of the current value of money borrowed such as the announced prime rate of a bank, the rates borne by obligations of the United States or an index or other formula provided for by the governing body. The governing body shall employ a recognized agent in municipal bonds to market and remarket the bonds or commercial paper issued and to establish an interest rate in accordance with the approved index or formula.

3. The governing body may grant to the owner of any bond a right to tender, or may require the tender of, such bond for payment or purchase at one or more times before maturity and, in such event, shall enter into appropriate agreements with any bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company for purchase of bonds so tendered. Such agreement may provide that while the bonds are held by the bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company the bonds may bear interest at a rate higher than when the bonds are held by other owners, but not in excess of the maximum voted rate.

4. If bonds are tendered before maturity under an agreement to pay for or purchase bonds when tendered, the city or town may provide for the purchase and resale of such bonds pursuant to the tenders without extinguishing the indebtedness represented by them or incurring new indebtedness on the resale, whether or not such bonds are represented by the same instruments when purchased as when resold.

5. Compensation for the resale of the bonds shall not be based on or measured by the difference between the price at which the bonds are purchased and the price at which they are resold.

B. The governing body may contract with a bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company to provide additional security for the bonds in the form of a line of credit, letter of credit, insurance policy or other security, may pay the costs of such additional security from amounts provided in the bond issue or from other available sources and may enter into reimbursement obligations in connection therewith, subject to the following:

1. Any reimbursement obligation entered into with the bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company shall not provide for the payment of interest in excess of the maximum voted rate. The reimbursement obligation does not constitute separate indebtedness of the city or town but is payable from the same source as the bonds, or from other available revenues, as determined by the governing body.

2. Administrative costs related to the reimbursement obligation may be deducted from bond proceeds or may be treated as interest, and these costs may be added to and paid from the proceeds of taxes levied to pay interest on the bonds, subject to the maximum rate and amount approved by the voters.

C. If the bonds are issued as commercial paper or bear interest at a variable rate, taxes shall be levied for the payment of principal and interest on such bonds based on the assumption that the bonds will bear interest at the maximum rate permitted under the terms of their issuance. If monies collected pursuant to such levy are more than sufficient to pay currently maturing principal and interest, the excess may be retained in the fund for the payment of interest and principal of the bonds and the next succeeding tax levy shall be reduced by the amount of the excess or the excess shall be used in whole or in part to pay the fees of any bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company which has agreed to provide monies with which to buy bonds tendered for purchase or is providing additional security for the bonds.

D. Variable rate bonds and commercial paper may be sold at competitive public sale or at negotiated sale. Notwithstanding section 35-457, a competitive public sale may be accomplished pursuant to a notice of sale which states such terms and conditions as may be provided by the governing body. The governing body shall distribute the notice of sale in the manner deemed to be in the best interests of the city or town.

E. If the bonds are to be issued in the form of commercial paper the governing body shall first provide for the establishment of the schedule for the maturities of the bonds within the maximum period permitted by the voted proposition. The individual instruments representing the bonds shall mature over shorter periods and may be retired with proceeds of subsequent instruments, or with the proceeds of definitive bonds, but they shall be finally paid according to the schedule of bond maturities or earlier. Bonds issued in the form of commercial paper may be sold through an agent in the form of instruments which mature at intervals the agent determines to be most advantageous to the issuer after giving public notice to potential investors as determined by the governing body.

F. Bonds may be issued as compound interest bonds bearing interest payable only at maturity but compounded periodically until that date at a rate no higher than the maximum voted rate. Notwithstanding section 35-458, taxes to pay the compound interest shall be levied annually and accumulated as the interest accrues unless the compound interest bonds are part of an issue which is amortized according to a plan that calls for the payment of other bonds as to principal and interest in earlier years and in amounts which would at least equal the annual interest payments on such compound interest bonds at the rate or rates borne by the bonds.

#### Section 35-459. Redemption of bonds and coupons

A. When any bonds mature, the county treasurer, when the bonds have been issued by the county, the city or town treasurer, when the bonds have been issued by a city or town, or the fiscal officer of other political subdivisions shall give notice for four weeks in a newspaper published in the county of intention to redeem and the amount of such bonds. The redemption shall be made and all such bonds shall cease to draw interest at the expiration of four weeks after the date of the notice. If the bonds so called for redemption are not presented within three months from the date of the notice, the treasurer shall apply the money to the redemption of the bonds next in the order of the number of their issue.

B. The interest coupons when due and payable shall be delivered to the treasurer or proper fiscal officer, who shall pay them and write the word "canceled" across the face of the coupons. Such canceled coupons shall be the treasurer's receipt for their payment.

C. When any bonds are redeemed, the treasurer or proper fiscal officer shall in like manner mark them "canceled" on the face of the bonds over his signature, and deliver them to the clerk or secretary of the governing body, taking a receipt for the cancelled bonds. The clerk or secretary shall file the bonds in his office and report the redemptions to the governing body.

#### Section 35-460. Erection of buildings

If bonds for the purpose of erecting and furnishing a public building are authorized at the election, the board of supervisors for a county and the governing body of a city, town or other municipal corporation shall authorize the design and construction of the building in accordance with title 34.

### Article 3.4 - Bonds Secured by Water Transportation Revenues

#### Section 35-468. Definitions

In this article, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Bond" means a bond authorized and issued under this article.

2. "Political subdivision" means any county, school district, community college district or special taxing district organized under title 48 in which remote municipal property, as defined in section 42-15251, is located.

3. "Water transportation revenues" means monies received by a political subdivision pursuant to section 9-433.

#### Section 35-468.01. Bonds secured by water transportation revenues

A. If a majority of the electors of a political subdivision voting at an election held pursuant to either article 3 of this chapter or title 15, chapter 4, article 5 authorizes the issuance of bonds, the political subdivision may issue the bonds so authorized either in the manner provided in this article or the manner prescribed by the article under which the election was authorized.

B. Bonds having an aggregate principal sum that exceeds the political subdivision's debt limit as set forth in article IX, section 8, Constitution of Arizona, may nonetheless be issued pursuant to this section if an amount equal to all principal in excess of the debt limit and all interest on that portion of principal is payable solely from water transportation revenues pledged by the political subdivision to payment of principal and interest on the bonds.

C. On sale of the bonds, a schedule shall be filed with the treasurer of the issuer showing the amounts of principal and interest to be paid at each principal and interest payment date. The schedule shall prorate each payment between the amounts to be paid from taxes and the amounts paid from water transportation revenues. The governing body may use any reasonable method of allocation as long as the total principal amount to be paid from ad valorem taxes computed as of the date of initial issuance of the bonds does not exceed the political subdivision's debt limit.

D. The political subdivision may pledge all or any part of the water transportation revenues it will thereafter receive to the payment of an amount of the debt service on the bonds equal to the principal and interest on the bonds that are not payable from taxes. This pledge constitutes an irrevocable assignment to the officer charged with paying the bonds that is binding on the political subdivision. No notice of the assignment need be filed or recorded and no public notice of any nature is required to make the pledge effective against any person claiming an interest in the water transportation revenues except a holder of the bonds. On receipt of any payment of water transportation revenues, the officer shall cause a sufficient portion of the amount received to be deposited in the redemption fund and interest fund established under section 35-468.03 pertaining to the bonds.

E. No bondholder may claim a preference as to source of payment over any other bondholder of the same series.

F. Neither a bondholder nor a political subdivision has any right or claim to receive payment from a city or town that makes payments relating to remote municipal property under title 9, chapter 4, article 3.

#### Section 35-468.02. Issuance of bonds

A. The governing body of the political subdivision shall authorize and issue the bonds, except that the board of supervisors of the county where a school district is located, or the larger portion of a school district, if the district is located in more than one county, shall act as the governing body of the school district solely for the purpose of selling, authorizing and issuing bonds of the school district. The bonds are fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes provided by title 47.

B. The bonds may be issued in one or more series, bear such dates, be payable in such medium of payment and at such places, bear such rates of interest, including variable rates, carry such registration privileges and prior redemption provisions, be executed in such manner, contain such other terms, covenants and conditions and be in such form as the governing body of the political subdivision may prescribe. The bonds shall be sold at, above or below par in such manner as the governing body may determine.

C. The portion of the principal of the bonds payable from water transportation revenues shall not be construed to be a debt of the political subdivision.

#### Section 35-468.03. Supplemental tax levy; interest fund; redemption fund

A. After the bonds are issued, the governing body or board issuing the bonds shall annually levy and cause to be collected a tax, at the same time and in the same manner as other taxes are levied and collected on all taxable property in the political subdivision, sufficient to pay the interest on the bonds when due and shall likewise annually levy a tax sufficient to pay the bonds at maturity, in each instance net of amounts to be paid from water transportation revenues so that the levy does not exceed the amount required to pay debt service on the bonds to be paid from taxes pursuant to the schedule filed under section 35-468.01, subsection C. Monies derived from the levy of the tax when collected shall be deposited in the interest fund and the redemption fund pertaining to the bonds.

B. The treasurer of the political subdivision issuing the bonds shall establish an interest fund and a redemption fund for paying the bonds. The treasurer shall deposit into such funds revenues received from taxes and water transportation revenues in amounts sufficient to pay the interest and principal of such bonds next maturing. The funds shall be used solely to pay principal and interest on the bonds.

#### Section 35-468.04. Pledge of revenues to secure debt instruments

Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, a political subdivision that receives water transportation revenues may pledge, by separate covenant included in the resolution authorizing the issuance of any bonds under this article or obligations it may incur, future receipts of such revenues to the payment of those bonds or obligations. The resolution authorizing those bonds or obligations may also provide for the assignment of such revenues to a trustee or paying agent for the purpose of securing the bonds. The pledge may be included in the resolution whether or not a reference to the pledge was included in the ballot submitted to the electorate of the political subdivision at the election authorizing the issuance of the bonds or obligations.

#### Section 35-468.05. Agreement of state

This state pledges to and agrees with the holders of the bonds that this state will not limit, alter or impair the rights vested in any political subdivision under this article to receive the monies, including water transportation revenues or an equivalent source, necessary to produce sufficient revenue to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the holders of the bonds, or in any way impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders, until all bonds issued under this article, together with interest, including interest on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceedings by or on behalf of the bondholders are fully met and discharged. The political subdivision may include this pledge and undertaking in its resolutions and indentures securing its bonds under this article.

#### Section 35-468.06. Bonds as obligation of political subdivision

Bonds issued under this article are obligations of the issuing political subdivision, are payable only according to their terms and are not general, special or other obligations of this state. The bonds do not constitute a legal debt of this state and are not enforceable against this state. Payment of the bonds is not enforceable out of any state monies other than the revenue pledged and assigned to, or in trust for the benefit of, the holders of the bonds.

#### Section 35-468.07. Supplemental law

This article is supplemental and alternative to any other provision of law that also enables a political subdivision to issue bonds.

### Article 4 - Refunding County and Other Municipal Indebtedness

#### Section 35-471. Refunding bonds; resolution authorizing issuance; definition

A. The board of supervisors, on behalf of the county, the governing body of a city or town or similar municipal corporation and a school district governing board may issue refunding bonds to refund the bonded indebtedness of such county, school district, city or town or other similar municipal corporation when it is expedient to do so.

B. The board of supervisors or other governing body desiring to issue refunding bonds shall adopt and include in its minutes a resolution stating:

1. The facts and determination of the necessity or advisability of refunding such bonded indebtedness, including an estimate of the present value of the debt service savings, net of all costs associated with the refunding bonds, that will occur.

2. The amount of bonds to be issued, the date of such bonds and the denominations.

3. The rate of interest and the maturity date.

4. The place of payment, within or without the state, of the principal and interest.

C. The amount of net premium associated with a refunding bond issue may be used only for one or more of the following:

1. To fund the escrow account to pay the bonds to be refunded.

2. To pay the costs incurred in issuing the refunding bonds.

3. As a deposit in a debt service fund and used to pay interest on the bonds.

D. If the net premium associated with a refunding bond issue is used to fund the escrow account to pay the bonds to be refunded and the principal amount of the refunding bonds is less than the principal amount of the bonds being refunded, the difference between such principal amounts reduces the available aggregate indebtedness capacity of the political subdivision under the constitution and statutes of this state in an equal amount, provided that the difference in the amounts may not exceed the aggregate available indebtedness capacity of the political subdivision.Â  The difference in principal amount will not cause any increase or decrease in the principal amount authorized pursuant to any bond election. Any net premium used as provided in this subsection shall be amortized for all debt limitation purposes on a pro rata basis each year by multiplying the net premium used by a percentage equal to the percentage of the total principal amount of the bond issue that matures in that year.

E. For the purposes of this section, "net premium" means the difference between the par amount of the bond issue and the bond issue price determined pursuant to United States treasury regulations.

 

#### Section 35-472. Form and contents of bonds; payment of principal and interest

A. The refunding bonds shall be negotiable in form, executed in the name of the county, school district, city or town or similar municipal corporation, signed by the chairman of the governing board or body, countersigned by the county or municipal treasurer, sealed with the seal of the county or municipality and attested by the clerk.

B. The principal and interest of the bonds shall be payable at the office of the county or municipal treasurer or at such other place as designated in the bonds and coupons, at the option of the holder.

#### Section 35-473. Limitation on issuance of refunding bonds

A. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 35-426 through section 35-429, or any other provision of law to the contrary, no bonds shall be issued by or on behalf of any county, school district, city or town, or other municipal corporation or political subdivision of the state for the purpose of calling or redeeming outstanding bonds which have not matured or which are not callable for redemption under the express provisions of the proceedings authorizing such bonds, but if the holder or holders of all or any portion of such bonds first consent thereto in writing, refunding bonds may be issued for the purpose of redeeming the bonds held by such consenting holder or holders.

B. Refunding bonds issued in advance of maturity of the bonds to be refunded shall only be issued in the manner set forth in section 35-473.01.

#### Section 35-473.01. Refunding bonds issued in advance of maturity of the bonds to be refunded; definition

A. Refunding bonds, designated as such, may also be authorized, issued and sold pursuant to this article for the purpose of refunding any bonds theretofore issued under the authority of article 3 of this chapter or under the authority of both article 3 of this chapter and title 9, chapter 5, article 3 or under the authority of title 15, chapter 4, article 5 and chapter 9, article 7 or by any political subdivision that is a public, corporate body under the laws of this state the property of which is exempt from taxation, for the purpose of refunding any bonds, theretofore issued under authority of law and payable from the proceeds of taxes, including assessments, which may be levied annually at uniform rates and are secured by property subject thereto in the political subdivision, in advance of the maturity or call date of such bonds to be refunded. If the weighted average maturity of the refunding bonds is at least seventy-five percent of the weighted average maturity of the bonds being refunded, no election on the issuance of the refunding bonds shall be required. If the refunding bonds are combined into a single issue with bonds authorized for nonrefunding purposes, the bonds so authorized for nonrefunding purposes shall have been submitted at an election as otherwise provided by law.

B. When refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section are sold, the net proceeds shall be invested in obligations issued by or guaranteed by the United States government, if these investments will mature with interest so as to provide funds to pay when due, or called for redemption, the bonds to be refunded together with interest thereon and redemption premiums, if any, and such proceeds or obligations shall, and other funds legally available for such purposes may, be deposited in the respective principal and interest redemption funds and shall be held in trust for the payment of the refunded bonds with interest and redemption premiums, if any, on maturity or upon an available redemption date or on an earlier voluntary surrender with the consent of the issuer.

C. For bonds that are issued to refund outstanding bonds that are issued before September 1, 2016, in advance of the maturity dates of such bonds, the holder of the refunding bonds shall rely on the sufficiency of the funds or securities held in trust for the payment of the refunded bonds. The issuance of refunding bonds shall in no way infringe on the rights of the holder of the refunded bonds to rely on a tax levy for the payment of principal and interest on the refunded bonds if the investments in the redemption funds prove insufficient. The total aggregate of taxes levied to pay principal and interest on the refunding bonds in the aggregate shall not exceed the total aggregate principal and interest to become due on the refunded bonds from the date of issuance of the refunding bonds to the final date of maturity on the bonds being refunded. Subject to such limitation, taxes in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on all refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section, then outstanding, the installments of the principal thereof becoming due and payable in the ensuing year, and the annual portion of such sinking fund as may be set up for retirement thereof, shall be levied, assessed and collected as other taxes of the political subdivision and the proceeds therefrom kept in a special fund and used only for the purposes for which collected.

D. For bonds that are issued to refund or refinance bonds that are issued from and after August 31, 2016, in advance of the maturity dates of such bonds, the holder of the refunded bonds shall rely on the sufficiency of the funds or securities held in trust for the payment of the refunded bonds. To the extent that payment of amounts on the refunded bonds is provided for by the deposit of funds and securities held in trust for the payment of the refunded bonds, all obligations of the political subdivision to levy a tax for the payment of such amounts shall cease and terminate.Â  The refunded bonds shall in no way infringe on the rights of the holders of the refunding bonds to rely on a tax levy for the payment of principal of and interest on the refunding bonds if the investments in the redemption funds prove insufficient. The total aggregate of taxes levied to pay principal of and interest on the refunding bonds in the aggregate shall not exceed the total aggregate principal and interest to become due on the refunded bonds from the date of issuance of the refunding bonds to the final date of maturity on the bonds being refunded.Â  Subject to such limitation, taxes in an amount sufficient to pay the interest on all refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section, then outstanding, the installments of the principal thereof becoming due and payable in the ensuing year, and the annual portion of such sinking fund as may be set up for retirement thereof, shall be levied, assessed and collected as other taxes of the political subdivision and the proceeds therefrom kept in a special fund and used only for the purposes for which collected.

E. Proceedings pursuant to this section shall be had by the board or boards that would be authorized to issue and sell the bonds to be refunded if such bonds were then to be issued and sold. The refunding bonds to be issued pursuant hereto may be of serial, including semiannual, or term maturities payable at any time on or before the maximum maturity date otherwise authorized by this article, and the provisions relating to execution, validity, records, place of payment and payment, cancellation and destruction on maturity of the bonds to be refunded shall apply to such refunding bonds.

F. Refunding bonds to be issued pursuant to this section may be combined with bonds otherwise authorized, provided that they are of equal priority.

G. The powers conferred by this section are in addition to, and not in substitution of, and the limitations imposed by this section shall not affect the powers conferred by any other law.

H. The amount of net premium associated with a refunding bond issue may be used only for one or more of the following:

1. To fund the escrow account to pay the bonds to be refunded.

2. To pay the costs incurred in issuing the refunding bonds.

3. As a deposit in a debt service fund and only to pay interest on the bonds.

I. If the net premium associated with a refunding bond issue is used to fund the escrow account to pay the bonds to be refunded and the principal amount of the refunding bonds is less than the principal amount of the bonds being refunded, the difference between such principal amounts reduces the available aggregate indebtedness capacity of the political subdivision under the constitution and statutes of this state in an equal amount, provided that the difference in the amounts may not exceed the aggregate available indebtedness capacity of the political subdivision.Â  The difference in principal amount will not cause any increase or decrease in the principal amount authorized pursuant to any bond election. Any net premium used as provided in this subsection shall be amortized for all debt limitation purposes on a pro rata basis each year by multiplying the net premium used by a percentage equal to the percentage of the total principal amount of the bond issue that matures in that year.

J. For the purposes of this section, "net premium" means the difference between the par amount of the bond issue and the bond issue price determined pursuant to United States treasury regulations.

 

#### Section 35-474. Levy of tax for payment of bonds; security

A. The board of supervisors, on behalf of the county or a school district in the county, or the governing body or board of a municipal corporation that has issued refunding bonds shall levy, during each year in which the bonds are outstanding, a tax on all property in the political subdivision for which the bonds are issued, sufficient to pay the annual interest on all bonds then outstanding and the annual installment of the principal thereof becoming due and payable in the next ensuing year.Â  The annual levy shall not exceed the net amount necessary to meet annual payments of principal and interest, projected payments of principal and interest on new debt planned for the ensuing year, a reasonable delinquency factor, including an amount necessary to correct prior year errors or shortages in the levy, if applicable, and any expenses and fees required in conjunction with the authorization pursuant to section 35-512. Such taxes shall be levied, assessed and collected at the same time and in the same manner as other taxes are levied, assessed and collected. The proceeds of the taxes shall be kept in a special segregated fund and shall be used only for the purpose for which collected.

B. All bonds, heretofore and hereafter issued, are secured by a lien on all revenues received pursuant to the tax levy.Â  The lien arises automatically without the need for any action or authorization by the political subdivision or the political subdivision's governing body or board. The lien is valid and binding from the time of the issuance of the bonds. The revenues received pursuant to the levy of the tax are immediately subject to the lien. The lien attaches immediately to the revenues and is effective, binding and enforceable against the political subdivision, the political subdivision's successors, transferees and creditors and all other parties asserting rights in the revenues, irrespective of whether the parties have notice of the lien, without the need for any physical delivery, recordation, filing or further act.

 

#### Section 35-475. Exchange or sale of bonds; record of bonds paid or retired

A. The refunding bonds may be exchanged in like amount for the bonds to be refunded, or they may be sold by the governing board or body at not less than par and accrued interest, and the proceeds applied to the purpose for which the bonds were issued.

B. The governing board or body shall keep a record disclosing the date, number, amount and maturity of each bond, the payments of interest or principal thereon, and its destruction when paid or retired. All bonds paid and retired shall be burned and destroyed by the governing board or body.

F. On the summary sale of a lot, acre or parcel subject to an assessment lien levied by a flood protection district, if there are no offers to purchase the assessment lien, the lot, acre or parcel shall be struck off to the municipality or district without any payment being made by the flood protection district, and the district shall be deemed the purchaser and shall be vested with all remedies that a purchaser at the sale would have obtained. In addition, the district or municipality may bring a judicial action to foreclose the delinquent assessment lien at any time after it becomes the purchaser. Â Such action shall be filed in the superior court in the county in which the district and the assessed lot, acre or parcel are located, and shall be prosecuted by the district in the same manner and with the same results as the foreclosure of a mortgage or other lien on real property.Â  This subsection shall not be construed to change the priority of the assessment lien levied by a flood protection district, and such a lien shall remain a first lien, subject only to the lien for general taxes.

The powers granted by this article shall include cancellation or reduction of interest, penalties and costs which may be levied as assessed upon the property within the district by reason of any previous delinquency in the payment of the taxes or special assessments.

C. The taxing district shall prescribe by ordinance or resolution the manner of holding the hearing provided by subsection B of this section and of giving notice thereof and the effect to be given to its determination at the hearing.

Issuance by the corporation of one or more series of bonds for one or more purposes shall not preclude it from issuing other bonds in connection with the same project or any other project, but the proceedings whereunder any subsequent bonds may be issued shall recognize and protect any prior pledge or mortgage made for any prior issue of bonds.Â  Any bonds of the corporation at any time outstanding may at any time and from time to time be refunded by the corporation by the issuance of its refunding bonds in such amount as the board of directors may deem necessary but not exceeding an amount sufficient to refund the principal of the bonds so to be refunded, together with any unpaid interest thereon and any premiums and commissions necessary to be paid in connection therewith.

In the event of default in such payment or in any agreements of the corporation made as a part of the contract under which the bonds were issued, whether contained in the proceedings authorizing the bonds or in any mortgage executed as security therefor, may be enforced by mandamus, the appointment of a receiver, or by foreclosure of any such mortgage, or any one or more of such remedies.

#### Section 35-913. Special allocations for mortgage revenue bonds and mortgage credit certificates; definitions

A. This section governs allocations of the state ceiling made by the director pursuant to section 35-902, subsection C.

B. If the portion of a corporation's allocation computed pursuant to subsection C of this section is less than ten million dollars, the director shall first award ten million dollars of the state allocation to that corporation. Thereafter, the director shall award the remaining state allocation in the same proportion that the population of each of the remaining corporations' jurisdictions bears to the population of this state according to the census, minus the population of the corporations receiving a ten million dollar allocation pursuant to this subsection.

C. Each corporation that is described in section 35-706, subsection E and that submits a request for allocation pursuant to section 35-902, subsection C shall receive a portion of the allocation made by the director in the same proportion that the population of that corporation's jurisdiction bears to the population of this state, according to the census but in no event less than ten million dollars.

D. At any time before submitting a formal request for allocation, but no later than January 31, a corporation described in section 35-706, subsection E may submit to the director an allocation reservation for an amount not to exceed that portion of the allocation to which the corporation is entitled pursuant to this subsection. The allocation reservation may include an offer to use additional allocation amounts described in subsection E of this section for rural areas. On or before January 31, the Arizona industrial development authority may submit to the director an allocation reservation for the amounts described in subsection E of this section for rural areas. The allocation reservation does not constitute a formal request for allocation and does not obligate the Arizona industrial development authority or a corporation to submit a request for allocation.

E. The director shall require that one or more qualified mortgage revenue bond or qualified mortgage credit certificate programs benefit the residents of rural areas. Between February 1 and March 1, an allocation of the unreserved portion of the state ceiling under section 35-902, subsection C shall be made by the director for this purpose. The recipient of this allocation shall be the Arizona industrial development authority, or the Arizona industrial development authority and one or more corporations, or one or more corporations that have executed a cooperative agreement and that have jointly submitted an allocation reservation pursuant to subsection C of this section. Â The director shall determine the recipient of the allocation described in this subsection by March 1 from the Arizona industrial development authority or one or more of those corporations that have offered to use the allocation described in this subsection in an allocation reservation submitted before February 1. If neither the Arizona industrial development authority nor any corporation offers an allocation reservation to use this allocation before February 1 the director shall select the Arizona industrial development authority or a corporation for that purpose.

F. If the director selects the Arizona industrial development authority, or the Arizona industrial development authority and one or more corporations or one or more corporations to serve rural areas, the Arizona industrial development authority, the Arizona industrial development authority and one or more corporations or the corporation or corporations shall receive confirmation of the allocation described in subsection E of this section before March 1.Â  Mortgage credit certificates or the proceeds of qualified mortgage revenue bonds made available through the portion of the state ceiling allocated pursuant to subsection E of this section shall be reserved for at least a one hundred eighty-day period exclusively for the financing of single family dwelling units in rural areas. The director may extend the one hundred eighty-day period at the time of allocation or a later time based on market conditions. The director at any time may modify any extension based on market conditions at the time. After the one hundred eighty-day period or any extension, whichever is later, the director may allocate any reservation that has not been used for use within the jurisdiction of any corporation that is described in section 35-706, subsection E and that gives its consent.

G. The validity of a confirmation for qualified mortgage revenue bonds or a qualified mortgage credit certificate program to benefit residents of part of the state shall not be affected by reason of qualified mortgage revenue bonds or a qualified mortgage credit certificate program receiving a confirmation to benefit residents of another part of the state not being issued.

H. Except as provided in subsections F and G of this section, a corporation shall not exercise the powers granted under section 35-706, subsection A, paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 outside of its own jurisdiction.

I. At the time a confirmation is issued the director shall determine in writing the allocation amounts in the manner described in this section. In determining the recipient or recipients for the allocation described in subsection E of this section, the director may consider the effectiveness of alternative program structures in rural areas. No action may be brought questioning the accuracy of any determination made by the director pursuant to this section without a finding of the director's bad faith or wilful misconduct.

J. Confirmations of the state ceiling under section 35-902, subsection C may be applied toward a qualified mortgage revenue bond program or qualified mortgage credit certificate program in any combination deemed appropriate by the issuing corporation with the approval of its governing body or by the board of the Arizona industrial development authority for a program for rural areas established by the Arizona industrial development authority.

K. Denial of approval of the use of qualified mortgage revenue bond proceeds or qualified mortgage credit certificates in a city or town pursuant to section 35-706 or subsection L of this section does not affect the validity of the allocation or affect the amount of state allocation that is allocated for that purpose.

L. The Arizona industrial development authority may not permit proceeds of bonds or a qualified mortgage credit certificate program in rural areas to be used to finance projects that are owner-occupied single family dwelling units within the corporate limits of an incorporated city or town, the unincorporated area of a county or a reservation for an Indian tribe, unless the governing body of the city, town, county or tribe has approved the general location and character of the residences to be financed. Before the issuance of bonds or mortgage credit certificates for that purpose, the authority shall give written notice to the governing body of each city, town, county or tribal reservation in which it intends to permit proceeds of an issue of bonds or mortgage credit certificates to be used to finance projects that are owner-occupied single family dwelling units and of the general location and character of the residences that may be financed.Â  The governing body of the city, town, county or tribe is deemed to have given its approval unless it denies approval by formal action of the governing body within twenty-one days after receiving the written notice from the authority.Â  Approvals given or deemed to have been given with respect to use of proceeds of an issue of bonds or mortgage credit certificates under this subsection may not be withdrawn.Â  Denials may be withdrawn by the governing body of a city, town, county or tribe and approval may be given after a denial is withdrawn if the authority approves the withdrawal of the denial.

M. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Census" means the most recent United States decennial census or the special census conducted in accordance with section 42-5033 if it is more recent than the most recent United States decennial census.

2. "Population" of a corporation's jurisdiction means population according to the census.Â  The population of a corporation formed on behalf of a county equals the population of the county minus the population of any other corporation that is within the county, that is described in section 35-706, subsection E and that submits a request for allocation pursuant to section 35-902, subsection C.

3. "Rural areas" means all of the area of this state that is not located within the jurisdiction of a corporation described in section 35-706, subsection E.

When deposits are made in accordance with this chapter, an official of a public depositor is not personally liable for any loss resulting from the default or insolvency of any eligible depository in the absence of negligence, malfeasance, misfeasance or nonfeasance on the part of public depositor or the depositor's agents.

 

#### Section 35-1207. Collateral for public deposits

A. An eligible depository shall not accept or retain any public deposit that is required to be secured unless the eligible depository has deposited the required collateral with a qualified escrow agent or the administrator, if required.Â  Every eligible depository shall deposit with a qualified escrow agent eligible collateral equal to or in excess of the required collateral.Â  Required collateral shall be one hundred two percent of public deposits less any applicable deposit insurance.Â  Eligible collateral shall be valued at current market value.Â  Substitutions and withdrawals of eligible collateral may be made without prior notification or consent by the public depositor.Â  The administrator shall provide written consent before withdrawals of collateral.Â  Substitutions of collateral may be made with notification to the administrator.

B. Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, an eligible depository shall not be required to give bond or pledge securities or instruments in the manner provided in this section for the purpose of securing deposits that are received or held in the trust department of the depository and that are secured pursuant to 12 United States Code section 92a.

 

#### Section 35-1208. Qualified escrow agent; substitutions

A. Eligible collateral shall be held as provided in this article or by policy of the administrator. Â Eligible collateral shall be held in the custody of any bank, including a federal reserve bank, or any depository trust company.

B. Each eligible depository shall provide in a written deposit or pledge agreement between the eligible depository and the custodian of the collateral, or in such other manner as prescribed by the administrator by policy, that:

1. In the event of default or insolvency of the eligible depository for which the collateral is held, the custodian shall surrender the collateral to the administrator.

2. The custodian shall reasonably make available to the administrator any books, records and papers pertaining thereto for any examination or other reason necessary for the administration of this article.

C. An eligible depository at any time may make substitutions of eligible collateral maintained or pledged for the purposes of this article and shall at all times be entitled to collect and retain all income derived from the collateral without restriction.Â  The authorization to make substitutions of eligible collateral pursuant to this subsection may be suspended or revoked by the administrator if the eligible depository has become the subject of increased regulatory oversight as a result of the eligible depository's failure to maintain capital standards required by the depository's primary regulator.

 

#### Section 35-1209. Reports of eligible depositories

At the request of the administrator, each eligible depository shall submit to the administrator a report, as prescribed by the administrator, showing the current market value of the depository's pledged collateral.Â  The report shall be certified as to its accuracy by an authorized official of the eligible depository.

 

#### Section 35-1210. Procedure for payment of losses

When the administrator determines that an eligible depository securing public deposits in accordance with this section is a defaulting depository, the administrator shall take steps as promptly as practicable to reimburse public depositors of all uninsured public deposits held by the defaulting depository using the following procedures:

1. The administrator shall determine the amount of uninsured public deposits net of any deposit insurance held by the defaulting depository either with the cooperation of the department of insurance and financial institutions or the receiver appointed for the defaulting depository or by any other means available.

2. The administrator shall assess the amount of the uninsured public deposits determined under paragraph 1 of this section against the defaulting depository. The administrator shall promptly take possession of the eligible collateral deposited by the defaulting depository with the depository's qualified escrow agent, to the extent necessary to satisfy the administrator's assessment, and shall liquidate the eligible collateral.

3. On receipt of the liquidated eligible collateral, the administrator shall reimburse the public depositors from the proceeds of the collateral to the extent of the defaulting depository's deposit liability to the depositor, net of any applicable deposit insurance.

#### Section 35-1211. Civil penalties; hearing; noncompliance

A. The administrator may assess against and collect the following from an eligible depository for noncompliance with the requirements of this chapter:

1. A civil penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars for each day the eligible depository fails to maintain with its qualified escrow agent eligible collateral as required by this article.

2. A civil penalty of not more than one hundred dollars for each day beyond the time period specified in this article or by the policy of the administrator that the depository negligently or wilfully fails to file in the office of the administrator a written report required by this article.

B. The eligible depository deemed in noncompliance may request a hearing before a civil penalty is imposed pursuant to this section.Â  Any civil penalty assessed under this section shall be paid within thirty days after receipt of the assessment, or the administrator may assess and collect an additional penalty of five per cent of the amount of the civil penalty for each month or part of a month that the payment is delinquent. The administrator may make available to the public relevant information regarding civil penalties assessed against an eligible depository.

C. Any penalties collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund.

D. If an eligible depository fails to pay the penalties assessed by the administrator pursuant to this section, the administrator may notify local agency treasurers with deposits in the eligible depository of the noncompliance.

 

#### Section 35-1212. Fees; public deposit administration fund

A. The administrator shall annually assess every eligible depository that is securing any uninsured public deposits pursuant to this chapter a fee in an amount established by the administrator for the enforcement and administration of this chapter.Â  The fees shall fairly and equitably apply to all eligible depositories that are securing any uninsured public deposits pursuant to this chapter calculated according to the proportion of aggregate public monies that each depository holds in relation to the total of all aggregate public deposits held by those eligible depositories for each annual period. Â For the purposes of this subsection, monies initially invested pursuant to section 35-323.01, subsection A, paragraph 1 and deposited pursuant to section 35-323.01, subsection A, paragraph 2 shall not be included in determining the aggregate public monies held by an eligible depository that is securing any uninsured public deposits pursuant to this chapter.Â  The administrator shall deposit the fees in the public deposit administration fund.

B. The public deposit administration fund is established in the state treasury.Â  The fund shall consist of fees deposited pursuant to subsection A of this section and all interest earned on the investment of the monies in the fund.Â  Any interest shall be credited at least annually to the fund.Â  Except as otherwise provided in subsection A of this section, monies in the fund are continuously appropriated to the administrator for the administration and enforcement of this chapter.Â  Monies in the fund are exempt from the provisions of section 35-190, relating to lapsing of appropriations.Â  Monies shall not be appropriated from the state general fund for payment of any expenses incurred under this chapter, and the expenses shall not be charged against the state.Â  Any monies remaining in the fund at the end of each fiscal year that exceed the cost of administering this chapter for that fiscal year shall be applied as a credit for fees assessed pursuant to this section or refunded the following calendar year to the participating eligible depositories.
