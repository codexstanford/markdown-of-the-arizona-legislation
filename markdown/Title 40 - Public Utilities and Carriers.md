The maximum rates, terms of service or standards of service are effective within forty days after the notice unless the commission suspends the effective date. This subsection does not diminish the commission's authority and duty to set just and reasonable rates. An order denying or modifying the filing shall not be ordered until after the commission holds a hearing and finds and determines that such action does not unduly burden or disadvantage the entity in a manner that is not competitively neutral in relation to other telecommunications providers competing in this state regardless of the technology used and the regulatory classification of the other providers.  Any period of suspension may not be longer than thirty days after the end of the forty-day notice period. At the end of the suspension period, the requested maximum rates, terms of service or standards of service are effective unless the commission has already acted on the request.

Before any hearing or supplemental or further hearing is had the commission shall give the corporation affected thereby at least thirty days' written notice, specifying the time and place of the hearing, but such notice shall not prevent the commission from making any preliminary examination or investigation into such matters or from inquiring into them in any other investigation or hearing.

C. The original or supplemental findings, so made and filed, when properly certified under seal, shall be admissible in evidence in any action, proceeding or hearing before the commission or any court in which the commission, the state, or any officer, department or institution thereof, or any county, city, municipality or other body politic, and the corporation affected, is interested, whether arising under the provisions of this article or otherwise. Such findings, when received in evidence in any action or proceeding arising under this article, shall be conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated as of the dates therein stated under conditions then existing, and such facts may only be controverted by showing a subsequent change in conditions bearing upon the facts therein determined.

D. Findings made at supplemental hearings or investigations shall be considered in connection with and as a part of the original findings except insofar as the supplemental findings change or modify the findings made at the original hearing or investigation.

E. For purposes of this section, the commission may establish simplified procedures and may by order or rule dispense with a hearing for a telecommunications corporation or a member-owned nonprofit cooperative corporation.

#### Section 40-252. Rescission or amendment of orders by commission; collateral attack on final orders or decisions prohibited

The commission may at any time, upon notice to the corporation affected, and after opportunity to be heard as upon a complaint, rescind, alter or amend any order or decision made by it. When the order making such rescission, alteration or amendment is served upon the corporation affected, it is effective as an original order or decision. In all collateral actions or proceedings, the orders and decisions of the commission which have become final shall be conclusive.

#### Section 40-253. Application for rehearing; hearing; effect; decision

A. After any final order or decision is made by the commission, any party to the action or proceeding or the attorney general on behalf of the state may apply for a rehearing of any matter determined in the action or proceeding and specified in the application for rehearing within twenty days of entry of the order or decision. Unless otherwise ordered, the filing of such an application does not stay the decision or order of the commission. If the commission does not grant the application within twenty days, it is deemed denied. If the commission grants the application, the commission shall promptly hear the matter and determine it within twenty days after final submission.

B. No claim arising from any order or decision of the commission shall accrue in any court to any party or the state unless the party or the state makes, before the effective date of the order or decision, application to the commission for a rehearing.

C. The application shall set forth specifically the grounds on which it is based, and no person, nor the state, shall in any court urge or rely on any ground not set forth in the application.

D. An application for rehearing shall not excuse any person from complying with and obeying any order or decision, or any requirements of any order or decision of the commission theretofore made, or operate in any manner to stay or postpone the enforcement thereof, except in such cases and upon such terms as the commission by order directs.

E. If, after a rehearing and a consideration of all the facts, including those arising since the making of the order or decision, the commission finds that the original order or decision or any part thereof is in any respect unjust or unwarranted, or should be changed, the commission may abrogate, change, or modify the order or decision, and such order or decision has the same force and effect as an original order or decision, but shall not affect any right or the enforcement of any right arising from or by virtue of the original order or decision, unless so ordered by the commission.

#### Section 40-256. Time periods for rate decisions; calculation; simplified filing rules; interim rates and charges; definitions

A. From the date on which a utility's rate filing is determined to be sufficient in accordance with this section, the commission shall issue a decision establishing rates and charges for service within the following time periods:

1. For class 1 utilities, within two hundred seventy days.

2. For class 2 utilities, within one hundred eighty days.

B. For the purposes of calculating the time periods prescribed in subsection A, a rate filing shall be deemed sufficient if it substantially complies with the commission's rules governing the filing requirements for applications for increased rates or charges for utility service. The utilities division shall review each rate filing to ascertain whether it substantially complies with the applicable rules and shall submit its findings to the commission not more than thirty days after the date of the rate filing. If it is determined that a rate filing does not substantially comply with the applicable rules, the utilities division shall notify the utility, in writing, of the basis for its determination to allow the utility to cure its filing. If this written notice is not provided within thirty days after the date of the utility's rate filing, the rate filing is presumed to be in substantial compliance with the applicable rules and the applicable time period established in subsection A begins. If any deficiencies in the rate filing are identified and written notice is given to the utility, the applicable time period begins on the date the rate filing is amended to cure the deficiencies.

C. On the motion of any party to the contested case proceedings relating to the rate filing or on its own motion, the commission may determine that an extraordinary event that would substantially alter the relief requested in the utility's rate filing has occurred. If such a determination is made, the time period prescribed in subsection A begins again from the date of the determination.

D. To expedite the issuance of final decisions and to minimize the fees and expenses incurred by utilities, the commission shall promptly adopt rules providing for simplified filing requirements and procedures for rate filings by utilities whose annual operating revenues do not exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars.

E. If a decision in the rate filing has not been issued within the required time period, the commission shall provide that the utility may implement reasonable modifications to rates and charges based on those proposed in the rate filing, on an interim basis, and subject to refund, pending the issuance of a final decision. Notice of the implementation shall be given by keeping open for public inspection new schedules stating the modifications to be made in the schedules then in force and by mailing a written notice to all customers of the utility advising them of the modifications at least thirty days before the effective date of the modifications. Any party to the contested case proceedings relating to the rate filing, including the utilities division, or the commission on its own motion may request that a hearing be scheduled for the limited purpose of determining whether the utility should be required to file a bond approved by the commission in such amount and with sufficient security to ensure prompt payment of any refunds to the persons entitled to them, including an interest rate of not more than the maximum interest otherwise allowed by law, if the modified rates or charges placed into effect are finally determined by the commission to be excessive. The utility may substitute for the bond other arrangements satisfactory to the commission for the protection of the parties involved.

F. For purposes of this section:

1. "Annual operating revenues" means gross utility operating revenues derived from a utility's jurisdictional operations, including the requested rate relief.

2. "Class 1 utility" means a utility with annual operating revenues of one million dollars or more.

3. "Class 2 utility" means a utility with annual operating revenues of less than one million dollars.

4. "Combination utility" means a utility that provides more than one of the commodities or services in paragraph 7. For combination utilities, departmental operating revenues shall be used for classification purposes.

5. "Decision" means a final order, decision or determination of the commission that disposes of all issues involved in all parts or phases of the proceedings before the agency concerning a rate filing.

6. "Rate filing" means an application filed by a utility for the permanent modification to any rate or charge for service requiring the commission to determine the fair value of the utility's jurisdictional property used for the provision of utility service and the rate of return.

7. "Utility" means a public service corporation that is engaged in supplying electric, gas, telephone, water or sewer utility service in this state and that is subject to the jurisdiction of the commission.

A. A public service corporation, other than a railroad, shall not begin construction of a street railroad, a line, plant, service or system, or any extension thereof, without first having obtained from the commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity.

B. This section shall not require such corporation to secure a certificate for an extension within a city, county or town within which it has lawfully commenced operations, or for an extension into territory either within or without a city, county or town, contiguous to its street railroad or line, plant or system, and not served by a public service corporation of like character, or for an extension within or to territory already served by it, necessary in the ordinary course of its business. If a public service corporation, in constructing or extending its line, plant or system, interferes or is about to interfere with the operation of the line, plant or system of any other public service corporation already constructed, the commission, on complaint of the corporation claiming to be injuriously affected, may, after hearing, make an order and prescribe terms and conditions for the location of lines, plants or systems affected as it deems just and reasonable.

C. No such corporation shall exercise any right or privilege under any franchise or permit without first having obtained from the commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity.

E. When the commission determines after notice and hearing that any product or service of a telecommunications corporation is neither essential nor integral to the public service rendered by such corporation, it shall declare that such product or service is not subject to regulation by the commission.

B. Every applicant for a certificate shall submit to the commission evidence required by the commission to show that the applicant has received the required consent, franchise or permit of the proper county, city and county, municipal or other public authority.

C. The commission may, after a hearing, issue the certificate or refuse to issue it, or issue it for the construction of only a portion of the contemplated street railroad, line, plant or system, or extension thereof, or for the partial exercise only of the right or privilege, and may attach to the exercise of rights granted by the certificate terms and conditions it deems that the public convenience and necessity require. The commission may act after an application or after a hearing, if requested by any party, on an application for a certificate to provide any of the following telecommunications services:

1. Pay telephone service to end users if the applicant has not received a certificate to provide local exchange telecommunications service within the area where the pay telephone is or will be located.

2. Automated or live operator services accessed from a location where telephones are available to the public or transient users of the premises and where the applicant has not been certificated as either:

(a) A local exchange carrier for the location by January 1, 1996.

(b) A facilities based interexchange carrier by January 1, 1996.

3. Telecommunications services resold to the public for profit if the applicant obtains the services from another entity.

D. If a public service corporation desires to exercise a right or privilege under a franchise or permit which it contemplates securing, but which has not yet been granted to it, the corporation may apply to the commission for an order preliminary to the issue of the certificate. The commission may make an order declaring that it will thereafter, upon application, under rules it prescribes, issue the desired certificate, upon terms and conditions it designates, after the corporation has obtained the contemplated franchise or permit or may make an order issuing a certificate on the condition that the contemplated franchise or permit is obtained and on other terms and conditions it designates. If the commission makes an order preliminary to the issuance of the certificate, upon presentation to the commission of evidence that the franchise or permit has been secured by the corporation, the commission shall issue the certificate.

#### Section 40-283. Transmission lines; use of public streets for utility right-of-way; notice; election

A. Any person engaged in transportation or transmission business within the state may construct and operate lines connecting any points within the state and connect at the state boundary with like lines, except that within the confines of municipal corporations the use and occupancy of streets shall be under rights acquired by franchises according to law or licenses pursuant to title 9, chapter 5, articles 1.1 and 4, and subject to control and regulation by the municipal authorities. The use of highways, except state highways, by public utilities not within any incorporated city or town shall be regulated by the board of supervisors of the county by license or franchise.

B. A board of supervisors in granting a license or franchise, or at any time after it is granted, may impose restrictions and limitations upon the use of the public roads as it deems best for the public safety or welfare.

C. Every franchise granted under this article shall include provisions requiring the grantee to bear all expenses, including damage and compensation for any alteration of the direction, surface, grade or alignment of a county road, made for the purpose of such franchise. If the surface of a county highway is used by any grantee for trackage, the franchise shall include reasonable regulations for maintenance by the grantee of that portion of the highway so used.

D. A board of supervisors may authorize public service corporations, telecommunications corporations, cable operators or video service providers to construct a line, plant, service or system within the right-of-way of any road, highway or easement that is designated for access or public use by plat or survey of record of a subdivision, or of unsubdivided land as defined in section 32-2101, provided that any such authorization or construction pursuant to such authorization does not impose on the county the duty of maintaining the road or highway unless the county accepts the road or highway into the county maintenance system by appropriate resolution. This subsection does not grant county boards of supervisors additional authority to require public service corporations, telecommunications corporations, cable operators or video service providers to obtain licenses or franchises.

E. A board of supervisors, before granting any of the privileges authorized under this section, shall give public notice of its intention to grant such privileges by publishing notice in a newspaper of general circulation, published within the county, at least once a week for three weeks before the day set for consideration of such action. If, on or before such date, more than fifty percent of the qualified electors of the county petition the board of supervisors to deny the privilege, it shall do so, and any privilege granted against the petition is void.

#### Section 40-286. Exemption from antitrust statutes

Title 44, chapter 10, article 1, does not apply to any conduct or activity of a public service corporation holding a certificate of public convenience and necessity granted pursuant to this article, which conduct or activity is approved by a statute of this state or of the United States or by the corporation commission or an administrative agency of this state or of the United States having jurisdiction of the subject matter.

#### Section 40-346. Hearing on petition by corporation commission, board of supervisors or city or town council; determination of economic and technical feasibility; addition or elimination of certain areas

A. The corporation commission, board of supervisors or city or town council, as the case may be, shall hold a hearing, upon notice as provided in this article, to establish the fact that the requirements for the establishment of an underground conversion service area have been satisfied, and that owners of no more than forty per cent of the real property within the underground conversion service area, or no more than forty per cent of the owners of real property, have not objected to the formation of the underground conversion service area, and if the commission, board of supervisors or city or town council so determines, and if the commission, board of supervisors or city or town council further determines after considering all objections, that the cost of conversion as reflected in the joint report prepared pursuant to section 40-342 is economically and technically feasible for the public service corporations or public agencies involved and the property owners affected and that the underground conversion service area is a reasonably compact area of reasonable size, the commission, board of supervisors or city or town council shall then issue an order establishing the area as an underground conversion service area. In those cases where the commission, the board of supervisors and the city or town council have jurisdiction, all must issue orders establishing the area as an underground conversion service area before the public service corporations and public agencies owning overhead electrical or communication facilities therein shall be required to convert such facilities to underground.

B. If the corporation commission, board of supervisors or city or town council, as the case may be, should conclude at the hearing that territory not included in the petition should be included within the underground conversion service area, the real property owners in the additional territory shall be notified in like manner as provided in connection with the original hearing, and a subsequent hearing shall be held on the question of including the additional territory. In establishing the underground conversion service area, the corporation commission, the board of supervisors or the city or town council shall eliminate any territory described in the petition which it finds will not be benefited by the establishment of the underground conversion service area or in which it finds that conversion is not economically or technically feasible.

C. Additions to and alterations of an underground conversion service area shall be made in the manner provided for the establishment of the underground conversion service area.

D. Upon the order of the commission, board of supervisors or city or town council establishing the area as an underground conversion service area, the commission, board of supervisors or city or town council shall then direct the public service corporations or public agencies owning overhead electric or communication facilities, as defined in section 40-341, within the underground conversion service area to convert such facilities to underground in accordance with standard underground practices.

E. If the petition for the establishment of an underground conversion service area requests the conversion of facilities used or maintained to be used for the transmission of electric energy at nominal voltages in excess of twenty-five thousand, or having a current capacity in excess of twelve thousand kva, protests and objections may be filed separately for the conversion of electric facilities and such other facilities. The commission, board of supervisors or city or town council may order the conversion of electric facilities if the owners of no more than forty per cent of the real property within the underground conversion service area and no more than forty per cent of the owners of real property have not objected to the conversion of the electric facilities but have objected to the conversion of such other facilities, in which event the commission, board of supervisors or city or town council shall order the establishment of the underground service area for the conversion of electric facilities only. If the owners of not more than forty per cent of the real property within the underground conversion service area and no more than forty per cent of the owners of real property have not objected to the conversion of electric facilities and such other facilities and the commission or board makes such further determinations as are required by subsection A of this section, then the city or town council, the board of supervisors or the commission may order the establishment of an underground conversion service area for the purpose of converting the electric facilities and such other facilities and the cost of converting such other facilities shall be included in the underground conversion costs and shall be assessed to each lot or parcel of real property in the same manner as provided for in section 40-347.

F. The order of the commission, the board of supervisors or the city or town council establishing the underground conversion service area shall set forth the underground conversion costs to be charged to each lot or parcel.

#### Section 40-347. Establishment of conversion costs; apportionment of costs; method of payment

A. The order authorizing the establishment of the underground conversion service area shall authorize each public service corporation or public agency whose overhead electric or communication facilities are to be converted to charge the underground conversion costs to each lot or parcel of real property within the underground conversion service area.  The underground conversion costs shall be in an amount sufficient to repay the public service corporation or public agency for the following:

1. The remaining undepreciated original costs of the existing overhead electric and communication facilities to be removed as determined in accordance with the uniform system of accounts applicable to the public service corporation or public agency.

2. The actual costs of removing such overhead electric and communication facilities, less the salvage value of the facilities removed.

3. The contribution in aid of construction which the public service corporation or public agency would require under its rules and regulations applicable to underground conversion service areas.

4. If not paid in full as provided in section 40-348, the actual cost of converting to underground the facilities from the public place to the point of delivery on the lot or parcel owned by each owner receiving service, in the case of an electric public service corporation or public agency, or to the connection point within the house or structures, in the case of a communication corporation, less any credit which may be given such owner under the line extension policy of the public service corporation or public agency then in existence.

5. If property belonging to the United States, this state, county, city, school district or any other political subdivision or institution of the state or county is included in the underground conversion service area, and they do not voluntarily assume such costs, the underground conversion cost applicable to such property shall be charged pro rata against the remaining property included within the underground conversion service area.

B. The cost incurred in placing underground the facilities in public places shall be apportioned among the owners of property within the area on the basis of relative size of each parcel by the corporation commission, the board of supervisors or the city or town council. The underground conversion cost, as determined by the method prescribed in subsection A shall not exceed the estimated costs indicated in the joint report prepared by the public service corporation or public agency pursuant to subsection D of section 40-342 and, may be paid in cash by the property owners within sixty days from the date the overhead facilities are removed from public places, or may be paid by a uniform plan applicable to all property owners not paying within the sixty-day period in equal periodic installments over a reasonable period of time, not exceeding fifteen years, as established by the corporation commission, the board of supervisors or the city or town council, together with interest at a rate to be determined by the corporation commission, the board of supervisors or the city or town council but not to exceed eight per cent per annum.

C. If funds become available from other public or private sources to pay all or any part of the underground conversion costs, any such funds shall be applied on a pro rata basis to reduce the underground conversion cost charged against each parcel or lot.

D. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection B of this section, the public service corporation or public agency serving such area may by agreement with all the owners of the property in an underground conversion service area provide for reimbursement to it of the cost of such conversion on a different basis as to payment or security than that set out by the terms of this article.

#### Section 40-348. Conversion of service lines on owner's property; payment; notice of disconnection to owner

A. The service facilities within the boundaries of each lot or parcel within an underground conversion service area shall be placed underground at the same time as or after the underground system in private easements and public places is placed underground. The public service corporation or public agency involved, directly or through a contractor, shall, at the expense of the owner, convert to underground its facilities on any such lot or parcel up to the point of delivery, in the case of an electric public service corporation or public agency, or to the connection point within the house or structure, in the case of a communication corporation, upon being requested by the owner. Overhead electric service facilities beyond the point of delivery to the service entrance shall be placed underground by the owner, acting directly or through a contractor.

B. If the property owner does not reimburse the public service corporation or public agency in cash for all such costs or expenses so incurred by it within thirty days after completion of such conversion, or reach other agreement with the public service corporation or public agency involved for payment in some other manner, such costs shall be included in the costs on which the underground conversion cost for such property is calculated, as provided by this article.

C. Upon completion of the underground system in public places the corporation commission, board of supervisors or city or town council, as the case may be, shall mail a notice to each owner of a lot or parcel located therein advising him of the provisions of subsection A and stating that unless such owner complies with the requirements of such subsection within thirty days thereafter, all buildings, structures and improvements located upon the lot or parcel will be subject to disconnection from the electric or communication facilities providing service thereto. Thereafter if the owner of any lot or parcel shall fail to comply within the time specified, the public service corporation or public agency providing electric or communication service shall disconnect and remove all overhead electric or communication facilities providing service to any building, structure or improvement located upon such lot or parcel.  Written notice of the proposed disconnection shall be given at least thirty days prior to disconnection by leaving a copy of such notice at the principal building, structure or improvement located upon such lot or parcel.

#### Section 40-349. Permit or easement for conversion of service lines to be furnished by owner

A. The public service corporation or corporations or public agency or agencies shall not commence the work referred to in section 40-348 on property other than private easements or public places until the owner has furnished a permit or easement to the public service corporation or public agency, expressly authorizing such public service corporation or public agency and its representative officers, employees, agents and contractors to enter upon such lot or parcel for such purpose and agreeing to the inclusion of the costs thereof in the underground conversion service costs in the event such costs or any part thereof remain unpaid thirty days after completion.

B. The public service corporation or public agency shall remove its overhead facilities replaced by underground facilities in accordance with this article in the area after the underground system in the private easements and public places has been energized, thereby discontinuing service to those parcels or lots whose owners have not furnished a permit or easement as provided in subsection A of this section.

A. A person shall not make or begin any excavation in any public street, alley, right-of-way dedicated to the public use or public utility easement or in any express or implied private property utility easement or in any apartment community or mobile home park without first determining whether underground facilities will be encountered, and if so where they are located from each and every underground facilities operator and taking measures for control of the facilities in a careful and prudent manner.  For all excavations in an apartment community or mobile home park, the excavator shall inform the landlord as promptly as practical that the excavator intends to submit an inquiry to the landlord that will trigger the landlord's obligations provided by subsection B of this section and the inquiry itself shall be made by certified mail to the landlord, using a form prepared by a one-call notification center.  The inquiry to a landlord may be made by a one-call notification center for a reasonable fee to the excavator.

B. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, upon receipt of the excavator's inquiry, the underground facilities operator shall respond as promptly as practical, but in no event later than two working days, by carefully marking such facility with stakes or paint or in some  customary  manner.  A landlord shall respond in the same manner and as promptly as practical, but in no event later than ten working days.  No person shall begin excavating before the location and marking are complete or the excavator is notified that marking is unnecessary.  If the excavator consents, an underground facilities operator may notify a one-call notification center that marking is unnecessary pursuant to a method established by the one-call notification center.  An underground facilities operator may assign any marking or notification obligations required by this subsection to an agent or servant of the underground facilities operator.  An underground facilities operator may notify the excavator that marking is unnecessary pursuant to any mutually agreeable method.

C. On a timely request by the underground facilities operator, the excavator shall mark the boundaries of the area requested to be excavated in accordance with a color code designated by the commission or by applicable custom or standard in the industry.  A request under this subsection for excavator marking does not alter any other requirement of this section.

D. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, a person shall not begin excavating in any apartment community or mobile home park before the landlord has completed marking the underground facility or the excavator is notified that marking is unnecessary.  After underground facility markings are complete or the excavator has received notice that marking is unnecessary, an excavator shall notify the landlord if any of the following conditions exist:

1. Visible and obvious evidence, such as pavement cuts, that would alert a reasonable excavator to the presence of an unmarked underground facility within the boundary of the intended area of excavation.

2. The excavator has concerns regarding the accuracy and meaning of the marks.

3. The excavator encounters an underground facility that has not been marked.

4. The excavator encounters an underground facility that has been incorrectly marked or marked in the wrong location.

E. For every excavation in an apartment community or mobile home park where the excavation method is boring:

1. Every underground facilities operator shall be notified of this methodology.

2. The excavator shall ensure that sufficient clearance is maintained between the bore path and any marked underground facility.

3. The excavator shall visually check the drill head each time it passes through potholes, entrances and exit pits, including during pullback.

4. Each underground facilities operator shall be given a reasonable opportunity to inspect its facility before and during the boring operation.

F. If a landlord fails to respond to an excavator's request in a manner required by this article, an excavator does not violate this article and fulfills the standard of care of a reasonably prudent excavator if the excavator complies with all of the following:

1. One working day before conducting the excavation, the excavator notifies the landlord in writing or by fax that the excavator has determined that the acts or omissions of the landlord is a refusal to respond to an excavator's request.

2. The excavator investigates for the presence of visible and obvious evidence that would alert a reasonable excavator to the presence of an unmarked underground facility within the boundaries of the area to be excavated.

3. The excavator carefully locates all unmarked facilities that are known to exist due to the excavator's investigation performed pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection using one of the methods listed in subsection G of this section and carefully marks the facilities with stakes or paint or in some customary manner.  In addition, when a landlord provides verbal or written information regarding the location of underground facilities that are within the boundaries of the area to be excavated, the excavator carefully locates all such identified facilities using one of the methods listed in subsection G of this section and carefully marks the facilities with stakes or paint or in some customary manner.

4. The excavator takes measures to control all such located facilities in a careful and prudent manner.

5. The excavator shall not excavate if the excavator receives a response from the landlord that notifies or alerts the excavator to the presence of a mistake or an intention by the landlord to respond in a manner that is consistent with this article, even if the response will be untimely. A landlord's delay, failure to respond to a location request, failure to mark or other noncompliance is not excused by the excavator's or landlord's compliance with this subsection.

G. Except as otherwise provided in this section, in performing the marking required by subsection B of this section, the underground facilities operator of an underground facility installed after December 31, 1988 in a public street, alley or right-of-way dedicated to public use or public utility easement, but not including any express or implied private property utility easement, shall carefully locate the facility by referring to installation records of the facility that are in the possession of the underground facility operator and utilizing one of the following methods:

1. Vertical line or facility markers.

10. Surface extensions of underground facilities.

11. Any other surface or subsurface location technique that is at least as accurate as the other marking methods in this subsection and that is not prohibited by the commission or by federal or state law. This paragraph does not obligate an underground facilities operator to be aware of and utilize every surface or subsurface location technique available.

H. Except as otherwise provided in this section, for an underground facility other than one installed after December 31, 1988, in a public street, alley or right-of-way dedicated to public use or public utility easement, in performing the marking required by subsection B of this section, the underground facilities operator may refer to installation records or other records relating to the facility to assist in locating the facility and shall carefully locate the facility utilizing one of the methods listed under subsection G of this section.

I. If an underground facilities operator is unable to complete the location and marking within the time period provided by subsection B of this section, the facilities operator shall satisfy the requirements of this section by providing prompt notice of these facts to the excavator and assigning one or more representatives to be present on the excavation site at all pertinent times as requested by the excavator to provide facility location services until the facilities have been located and marked or the excavator is notified that marking is unnecessary pursuant to any mutually agreeable method. A person that receives notice from the underground facilities operator of these facts shall not begin excavating before the underground facilities operator has completed marking the underground facility or the excavator is notified that marking is unnecessary. Except as provided in subsection J of this section, the underground facilities operator shall bear all of its own expenses associated with assigning representatives.

J. The marking required by subsection B of this section is valid for fifteen working days from the date of the marking.  If the excavation will continue past the validity period of the marks as provided by this subsection, the excavator shall notify the underground facilities operator or an organization designated by the underground facilities operator at least two working days before the end of the validity period.  All requests for facility markings and requests to extend the validity period of the markings shall be for the purpose of excavating within the validity period of the markings.  An excavator that requests facility markings shall limit the request to an area that can reasonably be excavated within the validity period of the markings.  A person who violates this subsection is liable to the one-call notification center and to all affected underground facilities operators for any damages proximately caused by the violation, including economic loss.

K. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent an excavator and an underground facilities operator from holding a preconstruction conference regarding marking and location of underground facilities and entering into a mutually agreeable written schedule for marking or excavating or written arrangement that may constrain the excavation methods or that may provide for the delivery of installation records to the excavator for the purpose of satisfying the requirements of this section, except that this subsection does not eliminate the excavator's obligation to notify the underground facilities operator to locate and mark excavation sites under subsection B of this section based on the actual construction schedule.

L. For abandoned and apparently abandoned underground facilities:

1. The underground facilities operator shall notify the excavator whether the facility is active or abandoned.  An inactive facility shall be considered active for purposes of this subsection.  This section does not obligate any person to represent that an underground sewer facility in any public street, alley, right-of-way dedicated to public use or public utility easement is abandoned if it was installed on or before December 31, 2005 and it is not owned by an underground facilities operator of a sewer system. This paragraph does not obligate a landlord to represent that an underground facility in any apartment community or mobile home park is abandoned if it was installed before January 1, 2007.

2. For an underground facility abandoned after December 31, 1988 or covered by installation records prepared under section 40-360.30, the underground facilities operator may not advise or represent to the excavator that a facility or portion of a facility is abandoned unless the underground facilities operator has verified, by reference to installation records or by testing, that the facility or portion is actually abandoned and not merely inactive. For all other abandoned or apparently abandoned underground facilities, each one-call notification center shall establish a method of providing personnel from an underground facilities operator qualified to safely inspect and verify that the facility is abandoned or active.  For the purposes of this article, an underground facilities operator shall not represent that an underground facility is abandoned unless the facility has been verified as abandoned pursuant to this subsection.

3. For the purposes of this article, if an excavator encounters an apparently abandoned underground facility, the excavator shall not treat the underground facility as abandoned until the excavator has received notification that the underground facility is abandoned pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection or has notified the underground facilities operator of the apparent abandonment and has received verification of abandonment pursuant to paragraph 2 of this subsection.

4. Each one-call notification center may establish a method for reimbursing the verifying underground facilities operator for the expenses incurred under paragraph 2 of this subsection.  The reimbursement method shall not include any charge or expense to the excavator. A landlord that fails to advise or represent that an underground facility is abandoned pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection, whose underground facility is verified as abandoned pursuant to this subsection and who has not filed information with a one-call notification center is liable to the one-call notification center and to all affected underground facilities operators and excavators for the cost of verifying abandonment together with any damages, including economic loss, proximately caused by the violation.

M. All new and active underground facilities installed in any real property after December 31, 2005 shall be installed with a detectible underground location device unless the facility is capable of being detected from above ground with an electronic locating device or the facility is installed within single family residential property and is beneath a pool, permanent pool decking that is less than forty-eight inches from the pool or a permanent building.  A person who violates this subsection is subject to a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars. The building official shall administer and enforce this subsection for all underground facilities except those that are installed for a public utility or municipal corporation.  Any penalties received by the building official shall be deposited in the municipality's or political subdivision's general fund, as applicable.  Except as required by a city, town or county building code or other related code, for purposes of locating an underground facility a building official or political subdivision shall not compel the installation of one or more clean-outs on any underground sewer facility that is owned by another person and serves one customer where any portion of the underground sewer facility is in any public street, alley, right-of-way dedicated to public use, private property or easement.

N. Nothing in this section shall be construed as prohibiting the use of warning tape, warning markers or any other warning device by the underground facilities operator.

O. For every underground facilities operator of a sewer system:

1. For the purposes of this article, an underground facilities operator of a sewer system is responsible for locating and carefully marking the underground sewer facilities owned by another person pursuant to subsection B of this section if those underground facilities are installed after December 31, 2005 and are in any public street, alley, right-of-way dedicated to public use or public utility easement.

2. In performing the marking required by this subsection, the underground facilities operator of the sewer system shall carefully locate the facility by referring to installation records of the facility and by using one of the methods listed in subsection G of this section.

3. This subsection does not obligate an underground facilities operator of a sewer system to locate and mark the underground sewer facilities owned by another person if the customer receiving sewer service from the underground sewer facility refuses to grant permission to the underground facilities operator of a sewer system to access the real property for the purpose of ascertaining the location of the underground sewer facility in any public street, alley, right-of-way dedicated to public use or public utility easement.

4. This subsection does not obligate an underground facilities operator of a sewer system to maintain, clean or unstop underground sewer facilities owned by another person.

P. For every landlord:

1. For the purposes of this article, each landlord is responsible for marking the underground facilities operated by the landlord pursuant to subsection B of this section.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "underground facilities operated by the landlord" includes every underground facility that is in an apartment community or a mobile home park and that:

(a) Discharges into an underground facility that is operated by the landlord.

(b) Is supplied by an underground facility that is operated by the landlord.

(c) Is not operated by a public utility or municipal corporation.

2. If a landlord is unable to complete the location and marking within the time period provided by subsection B of this section, the landlord shall satisfy its obligations in the manner provided by subsection I of this section.  Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the excavator and the landlord from entering into a mutually agreeable written schedule or written arrangement for satisfying the requirements of this section in the manner provided by subsection K of this section.
