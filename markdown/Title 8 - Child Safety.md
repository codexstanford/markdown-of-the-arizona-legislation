#### Section 8-105. Preadoption certification; investigation; central adoption registry

A. Before any prospective adoptive parent may petition to adopt a child the person shall be certified by the court as acceptable to adopt children. A certificate shall be issued only after an investigation conducted by an officer of the court, by an agency, by the department or by an entity contracted by the department to do an investigation and home study for foster home licensing or preadoption certification. A written application for certification shall be made directly to the court, to an agency, to the department or to an entity contracted by the department, in the form and content required by the court, agency or department.

B. The department is not required to accept every application for certification. In determining which applications to accept the department may give priority to applications filed by adult residents of this state who wish to adopt a child who has any special needs as defined in section 8-141.

C. After receiving and accepting the written and completed application of the prospective adoptive parent or parents, which shall include a financial statement and a physician's or a registered nurse practitioner's statement of each applicant's physical health, the department, the agency, an officer of the court or the entity contracted by the department shall conduct or cause to be conducted an investigation of the prospective adoptive parent or parents to determine if they are fit and proper persons to adopt children.

The prospective adoptive parent and each other adult member of the household must certify on forms that are provided by the department and that are notarized whether that person is awaiting trial on or has ever been convicted of any of the criminal offenses listed in section 41-1758.07, subsections B and C in this state or similar offenses in another state or jurisdiction.

G. The investigator shall not reveal to the prospective adoptive parents the identity of a child or the child's parent or parents and shall not reveal to the child or the child's parent or parents the identity of the prospective adoptive parents if these facts are not already known.

H. Within ninety days after the original application prescribed by subsection A of this section has been accepted, the department, the agency or the entity contracted by the department or a person or agency designated by the court to conduct an investigation shall present to the juvenile court the written report required by subsection F of this section, which shall include a definite recommendation for certifying the applicant as being acceptable or nonacceptable to adopt children and the reasons for the recommendation.

I. Within sixty days after receiving the investigation report required by subsections F and H of this section, the court shall certify the applicant as being acceptable or nonacceptable to adopt children based on the investigation report and recommendations of the report. A certification remains in effect for eighteen months from the date of its issuance and may be extended for additional one year periods if after review the court finds that there have been no material changes in circumstances that would adversely affect the acceptability of the applicant to adopt.

J. The court may require additional investigation if it finds that additional information is necessary on which to make an appropriate decision regarding certification.

K. Any applicant who has been certified as nonacceptable may petition the court to review that certification. Notice shall be given to all interested parties and notice may be given to the foster care review board if the child sought to be adopted is in out-of-home placement and is a dependent child or the subject of a dependency action.  The matter shall be heard by the court, which may affirm or reverse the certification.

L. If the applicant is certified as nonacceptable, the applicant may not reapply for certification to the court, to any agency, to the department or to an entity contracted by the department for one year.

M. The department shall maintain a central adoption registry that includes the names of all prospective adoptive parents currently certified by the court as acceptable to adopt children, except those who request that their names not be included, the names of all children who are under the jurisdiction of the department and who are currently available for adoption, the names of any other children who are currently available for adoption and whose names are voluntarily entered in the registry by any agency, parent or other person that has the right to give consent to the child's adoption, and other information as the department may elect to include in aid of adoptive placements.  Access to information in the registry shall be made available on request to any agency under assurances as the department may require that the information sought is in furtherance of adoptive placements and that confidentiality of the information is preserved.

N. This section does not apply if:

1. The prospective adoptive parent is the spouse of the birth or legal parent of the child to be adopted or is an uncle, aunt, adult sibling, grandparent or great-grandparent of the child of the whole or half-blood or by marriage or adoption.

2. The birth or legal parent is deceased but at the time of death the parent had legal and physical custody of the child to be adopted and the child had resided primarily with the spouse of the birth or legal parent during the twenty-four months before the death of the parent.

3. The grandparent, great-grandparent, uncle, aunt, great-uncle, great-aunt or adult sibling is deceased but at the time of death that person had legal and physical custody of the child to be adopted and the child had resided primarily with the spouse of the grandparent, great-grandparent, uncle, aunt, great-uncle, great-aunt or adult sibling during the twenty-four months before the death of the grandparent, great-grandparent, uncle, aunt, great-uncle, great-aunt or adult sibling.

4. The applicant is a licensed foster parent who is petitioning to adopt a child currently placed by the department in the foster parent's home and the department recommends the adoption of the child by the foster parent applicant.

O. If the applicant is not a licensed foster parent and has adopted a child within three years preceding the current application and is applying to adopt another child, the department, the agency or an entity contracted by the department or a person designated by the court to conduct an investigation shall only provide an update report on any changes in circumstances that have occurred since the previous certification.  If the applicant has adopted a child more than three years before the current application and is applying to adopt another child, the department, the agency or an entity contracted by the department or a person designated by the court to conduct an investigation may provide an updated report on any changes in circumstances that have occurred since the previous certification. The court shall certify the applicant as acceptable to adopt unless there are changes in circumstances that adversely affect the applicant's parenting ability. In making this determination, the court shall consider information from the prior certification.

 

#### Section 8-105.01. Adoption; racial preferences; prohibition; exception

A. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the division, an agency or the court shall not deny or delay a placement or an adoption certification based on the race, the color or the national origin of the adoptive parent or the child.

For purposes of this section, religiously affiliated organizations may qualify as community organizations provided that no state funding may be used for religious purposes.

#### Section 8-106. Consent to adoption; waiver; consent to the release of information; notification to potential fathers

A. The court shall not grant an adoption of a child unless consent to adopt has been obtained and filed with the court from the following:

1. The child's birth or adoptive mother, if living.

2. The child's father if any of the following is true:

(b) The father has adopted the child.

(c) The father's paternity is established under title 25, chapter 6, article 1 or section 36-334.

5. An agency that has been given consent to place the child for adoption by the parent or parents whose consent would be necessary under paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection, or that has been given authority in other legal proceedings to place the child for adoption.

6. The guardian of any adult parent for whom a guardian is currently appointed.

7. The division if it has been given consent to place the child for adoption by the parent or parents whose consent would otherwise be necessary pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection or if it has been given authority in other legal proceedings to place the child for adoption.  The court may waive the requirement for consent if the court determines, after a hearing on actual notice to all persons who may be adversely affected, that waiving the requirement is clearly in the child's best interest.

B. It is not necessary for a person to obtain consent to adopt from the following:

1. An adult parent for whom a guardian is currently appointed.

2. A parent whose parental rights have been terminated by court order.

3. A parent who has previously consented to an agency's or the division's placement of the child for adoption.

F. A notarized affidavit signed by the mother listing all potential fathers shall be filed with the court. The affidavit shall attest that all of the information contained in the affidavit is complete and accurate.

6. The potential father's responsibility to begin to provide financial support for the child if paternity is established.

7. That the potential father's failure to file a paternity action pursuant to title 25, chapter 6, article 1, and to serve the mother and proceed to judgment in the paternity action as prescribed by this section, bars the potential father from bringing or maintaining any action to assert any interest in the child.

H. Service on a mother of a title 25, chapter 6, article 1 paternity action pursuant to this section may be accepted by an attorney or agency that is licensed in this state and that is representing the mother. A mother may omit her address from the affidavit and notice to potential fathers if the address of her attorney or the agency is provided in the affidavit. Service on an attorney or agency pursuant to this subsection is limited to service of the initial verified petition and summons in the paternity action.  Service on the attorney does not make the attorney the attorney of record for the mother in the paternity action and does not make the agency the agent for the mother in the paternity action.

I. The notice required pursuant to subsection G of this section shall be in substantially the following form:

Notice:

Notice is given to _______________ that you have been identified by ______________________, the natural mother, as a potential father of a child to be born or, born on _____________, in _________.

2. Under sections 8-106 and 8-107, Arizona Revised Statutes, you have the right to consent or withhold consent to the adoption.

3. Your written consent to the adoption is irrevocable once you give it.

5. You have the obligation to proceed to judgment in the paternity action.

6. You have the right to seek custody.

7. If you are established as the child's father, you must begin to provide financial support for the child.

8. If you do not file a paternity action under title 25, chapter 6, article 1, Arizona Revised Statutes, and do not serve the mother within thirty days after completion of the service of this notice and pursue the action to judgment, you cannot bring or maintain any action to assert any interest in the child.

9. The Indian child welfare act may supersede the Arizona Revised Statutes regarding adoption and paternity.

10. For the purposes of service of a paternity action under title 25, chapter 6, article 1, Arizona Revised Statutes, service may be made on the mother at _____________ or her agency or attorney at ___________.

11. You may wish to consult with an attorney to assist you in responding to this notice.

J. A potential father who fails to file a paternity action and who does not serve the mother within thirty days after completion of service on the potential father as prescribed in subsection G of this section waives his right to be notified of any judicial hearing regarding the child's adoption or the termination of parental rights and his consent to the adoption or termination is not required.

#### Section 8-106.01. Putative fathers registry; claim of paternity; adoptive interest

A. A person who is seeking paternity, who wants to receive notice of adoption proceedings and who is the father or claims to be the father of a child shall file notice of a claim of paternity and of his willingness and intent to support the child to the best of his ability with the state registrar of vital statistics in the department of health services. The department of health services shall provide forms for the purpose of filing the notice of a claim of paternity. Forms shall be made available in the department of health services, the office of the clerk of the board of supervisors in each county, every hospital, every licensed child placement agency, the department of economic security, the department of child safety, sheriff's offices, jails, prisons, state department of corrections facilities and department of juvenile corrections facilities.

B. The notice of a claim of paternity may be filed before the birth of the child but shall be filed within thirty days after the birth of the child. The notice of a claim of paternity shall be signed by the putative father and shall include his name and address, the name and last known address of the birth mother and either the birth date of the child or the probable month and year of the expected birth of the child. The putative father who files a notice of a claim of paternity under this section shall notify the registrar of vital statistics of any change of his address. The department of health services shall maintain a confidential registry for this purpose. The department shall only respond to written inquiries of the confidential registry that are received from the court, the division, a licensed adoption agency or a licensed attorney participating or assisting in a direct placement adoption. The department shall provide a certificate signed by the state registrar of vital statistics stating that a diligent search has been made of the registry of notices of claims of paternity from putative fathers listing all filings found or stating that no filing has been found pertaining to the father of the child in question.

C. If the court determines the claimant is not the child's father it shall notify the department of health services and shall order the department to remove that person's name from the putative fathers registry.

D. If the mother denies that the putative father filing the notice of a claim of paternity is the father, the department of health services shall notify the putative father of his responsibility to establish paternity.

E. A putative father who does not file a notice of a claim of paternity as required under this section waives his right to be notified of any judicial hearing regarding the child's adoption and his consent to the adoption is not required, unless he proves, by clear and convincing evidence, both of the following:

1. It was not possible for him to file a notice of a claim of paternity within the period of time specified in subsection B of this section.

2. He filed a notice of a claim of paternity within thirty days after it became possible for him to file.

F. Lack of knowledge of the pregnancy is not an acceptable reason for failure to file. The fact that the putative father had sexual intercourse with the mother is deemed to be notice to the putative father of the pregnancy.

G. When a certificate provided pursuant to subsection B of this section is received by the court, the division, a licensed adoption agency or a licensed attorney participating or assisting in a direct placement adoption from the department that lists filings of a putative father or fathers, the putative father or fathers who filed timely notices of claims of paternity and who have not previously been served shall be served with the notice prescribed in section 8-106, subsection G. A putative father who fails to file a paternity action pursuant to title 25, chapter 6, article 1 within thirty days of completion of service of the notice prescribed in section 8-106 is barred from bringing or maintaining any action to assert any interest in the child.

H. If in any adoption proceeding there is not a showing that a putative father has consented to the adoption or has waived his rights regarding the proposed adoption, the petitioner shall file with the court, before the court enters a final decree of adoption, a certificate from the department of health services signed by the state registrar of vital statistics stating that a diligent search has been made of the registry of notices of claims of paternity from putative fathers and that no filing has been found pertaining to the father of the child in question.

 

#### Section 8-107. Time and contents of consent

A. All consents to adoption shall be in writing and signed by the person giving the consent and witnessed by two or more credible witnesses who are at least eighteen years of age and who subscribe their names in the presence of the person giving the consent or shall be acknowledged by the person giving consent before a notary public.

B. A consent given before seventy-two hours after the birth of the child is invalid.

C. The consent shall be dated, shall sufficiently identify and give the addresses of the party giving the consent and the name and address of the witness or witnesses and shall sufficiently identify the child to whose adoption the consent is given.

2. The particular person or persons authorized to adopt the child by the person giving the consent.

E. The true names of the adopting person or persons shall be used, except that fictitious names may be used if the consent also truthfully states that the adopting person or persons are currently certified as acceptable to adopt the child, that the consenting party knows that the names used are fictitious and does not wish to know the true names and that the consenting party has been furnished with all information which the consenting party wishes to know about the adopting person or persons.

F. The consent shall contain a statement which includes the following:

1. The consequences of the consent pursuant to section 8-117.

2. The irrevocability of the consent pursuant to section 8-106.

3. The prohibition of any direct or indirect compensation for the consent except as provided in section 8-114.

G. A consent other than to any agency or the division which does not designate a particular person or persons, or which purports to permit a third person to locate or nominate an adoptive parent, is invalid.

#### Section 8-108. Petition for child's custody by noncertified party; hearing; exceptions

A. A person who is not currently certified as acceptable to adopt but who has custody of a child who the person intends to adopt shall petition the court for an order permitting that person to keep custody of the child pending certification. The person shall file the petition not later than five days after the person obtains custody of the child. The court shall hold a hearing within ten days after the person files the petition. The child shall attend the hearing, except for good cause shown.  At the hearing the burden of proof is on the petitioner to show that permitting custody is in the child's best interests. The court may permit the petitioner to have custody or it may order that custody be given to some other person or agency as it deems to be in the child's best interests.  If the court permits the person to continue to have custody of the child, the court shall order the investigation for preadoption certification and report as required by section 8-105 to continue.  If an application for certification has not been filed before the hearing, the court shall order that an application for certification be filed within thirty days after the hearing date.

B. If a petition is not filed by the person intending to adopt a child, the division, an agency or any other interested person may petition the court for such a hearing. On the filing of a petition the court shall set the matter for hearing and issue its order to the person having custody of the child to appear before it to show cause why custody should not be denied. The hearing shall then be held and the court's order made as provided in subsection A of this section.

C. A custody petition or hearing is not required in any of the following cases:

1. If the person who intends to adopt the child is the spouse of a birth parent of the child.

2. If the person who intends to adopt the child or one of these persons is an uncle, aunt, adult sibling, grandparent, or great-grandparent of the child of the whole or half-blood or by marriage.

3. If the person who intends to adopt the child is currently certified as acceptable to adopt the child.

4. If custody of the child has been given or is to be given to an agency or to the division or to a licensed or certified foster home.

5. If the person who intends to adopt the child is currently the court appointed guardian of the child.

#### Section 8-109. Petition to adopt; contents

A. The potential adoptive parent or parents, an agency or the division may file a petition to adopt. The petition shall specify:

1. The full name, age and place of residence of the prospective adoptive parent and, if married, the date and place of marriage and the relationship if any to the child.

2. That a certificate of acceptability to adopt has been issued in favor of the prospective adoptive parent and the date of its issuance or the reason preadoption certification is not required.

9. Full disclosure of any fees or anything of value given or paid to any person or organization in connection with the adoption of the child.

B. Any written consent required by this article may be attached to the petition or may be filed after the filing of the petition at or before the hearing.

B. If the court, by order, authorizes the use of a fictitious name, the real name of the child shall be kept in a sealed envelope in the court file and shall not be opened except on order of the court after good cause has been shown.

#### Section 8-111. Notice of hearing on petition to adopt; service

After a petition to adopt has been filed, the clerk of the superior court shall set a time and place for a hearing by the court. Notice shall be as provided for the service of process in civil actions to:

On the filing of a petition the court shall hold a hearing within ten days, unless the hearing is waived for good cause shown.  The court shall approve living expenses that the person has paid, unless found unreasonable.  The person who wishes to pay the one thousand dollars in living expenses of a birth mother shall file an affidavit with the court signed by the birth mother verifying that the birth mother has been given written notice and that she understands that the payment of these expenses by any person does not obligate the birth mother to place the child for adoption and that a valid consent to the adoption can only be given after the child's birth without regard to any cost or expense paid by any person in connection with the adoption. A maximum of one thousand dollars may be advanced for birth parent living expenses without a motion.  In determining what living expenses are reasonable and necessary, the court shall consider but not be limited to the following factors:

The accounting shall include all living expenses, including living expenses advanced pursuant to subsection B for which a motion is not required, and shall be accompanied by an affidavit that is signed by the birth mother, either before or after the birth of the child, that verifies that she has been given written notice and that she understands that the payment of these expenses does not obligate her to place her child for adoption and that she may give a valid consent to the adoption only after the child's birth without regard to any cost or expense paid by any person in connection with the adoption.  This subsection does apply to an agency placement adoption or to a direct placement adoption made through an agency.

F. The court shall allow, disallow or allow in part fees, payments, disbursements and commitments as shown in the accounting.

The written order of the court shall include the findings of fact on which it based its order, including the court's jurisdiction and the date and place of birth of the child being adopted based on the best available evidence.

B. If the exact place of birth is unknown, the order shall include the information that is known and designate a place of birth according to the best information known as to the country of origin.

### Article 8 - Juvenile Competency

#### Section 8-291. Definitions

In this article, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Clinical liaison" means a mental health expert or another individual who has experience and training in mental health or developmental disabilities and who is qualified and appointed by the court to aid in coordinating the treatment or training of juveniles who are found incompetent to stand trial.  If developmental disability is an issue, the clinical liaison shall be an expert in developmental disability.

2. "Incompetent" means a juvenile who does not have sufficient present ability to consult with the juvenile's lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding or who does not have a rational and factual understanding of the proceedings against the juvenile. Age alone does not render a person incompetent.

3. "Juvenile" means a person who is under eighteen years of age at the time the issue of competency is raised.

4. "Mental health expert" means a physician who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 or a psychologist who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 19.1 and who is all of the following:

(a) Familiar with this state's competency standards and statutes.

(b) Familiar with the treatment, training and restoration programs that are available in this state.

(c) Certified by the court as meeting court developed guidelines.

 

#### Section 8-291.01. Effect of incompetency; request for examination

A. A juvenile shall not participate in a delinquency, incorrigibility or criminal proceeding if the court determines that the juvenile is incompetent to proceed.

B. At any time after the filing of a petition for delinquency or incorrigibility or a petition that seeks to transfer a juvenile to adult court, a party may request in writing or the court on its own motion may order that the juvenile be examined to determine if the juvenile is competent.  The request shall state the facts in support of the request for a competency examination. The presence of a mental illness, defect or disability alone is not grounds for finding a juvenile incompetent. The court shall not order a juvenile who is under the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to participate in a treatment program for the restoration of competency unless the court made a prior finding of probable cause pursuant to rule 3(f), rules of procedure for the juvenile court.

#### Section 8-291.02. Expert appointment; costs; immunity

A. If the court determines that grounds exist for a competency examination, the court shall appoint two or more mental health experts.  The mental health experts shall examine the juvenile, issue a report and, if necessary, testify regarding the juvenile's competency.  The court, on its own motion or upon motion of any party, may order that one of the mental health experts appointed shall be a physician specializing in psychiatry and licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17.  The state and the juvenile, upon approval of the court, may stipulate to the appointment of only one expert.

B. The court may order the juvenile to submit to any physical, neurological or psychological examination, if necessary, to adequately determine the juvenile's mental condition.

C. The county shall pay the costs of any examination that is ordered pursuant to subsection B, except that if a municipal court judge refers a case, the political subdivision shall pay the costs of the examination.

D. This section does not prohibit any party from retaining the party's own expert to conduct additional examinations at the party's own expense.

E. A person who is appointed as a mental health expert or a clinical liaison is immune from liability for acts or omissions pursuant to this section, except that the mental health expert or clinical liaison may be liable for intentional, wanton or grossly negligent acts that are done in the performance of the expert's or liaison's duties.

 

#### Section 8-291.03. Screening report

A. After the court determines that reasonable grounds exist to support the plea of insanity, the court or any party, with the consent of the juvenile, may request that the mental health expert provide a screening report.  The screening report shall include both:

1. The mental status of the juvenile at the time of the offense.

2. If the mental health expert determines that the juvenile suffered from a mental disease, defect or disability at the time of the offense, the relationship  of the disease, defect or disability to the alleged offense.

B. If the juvenile's state of mind at the time of the offense will be included in the examination, counsel for the juvenile shall provide the available juvenile court, medical and educational records to the court.  The court shall not appoint the expert to address the issue until the court receives the records.

C. Within ten working days after the mental health expert is appointed, the parties shall provide any of the juvenile’s additional medical or criminal history records that are requested by the court or the mental health expert.

#### Section 8-291.04. Examination; competency to stand trial

A. The court shall set and may change the conditions under which the examination of competency to stand trial is conducted.

C. The defense attorney shall be available to the mental health expert who conducts the examination.

D. A proceeding to determine if a juvenile is competent to stand trial shall not delay a judicial determination of the juvenile’s eligibility for preadjudication release.  Unless the court determines that a juvenile’s preadjudication detention is necessary for the evaluation process, a juvenile who is otherwise entitled to release shall not be involuntarily confined or detained solely because the issue of the juvenile’s competence to stand trial has been raised and an examination has been ordered.

E. If a juvenile is granted preadjudication release, the court may order the juvenile to appear at a designated time and place for an outpatient examination.  The court may make the juvenile’s appearance a condition of the juvenile’s preadjudication release from detention.

F. The court may order that the juvenile be involuntarily detained until the examination is completed if the court determines that any of the following applies:

1. The juvenile will not submit to an outpatient examination as a condition of release.

2. The juvenile refuses to appear for an examination.

3. An adequate examination is impossible without the detention of the juvenile.

G. If a juvenile is detained or committed for an inpatient examination, the length of the detention or commitment shall not exceed the period of time that is necessary for the examination.  The detention or commitment for examination shall not exceed thirty days, except that the detention or commitment may be extended by fifteen days if the court finds that extraordinary circumstances exist.  The county shall pay the costs of an inpatient examination, except that if a municipal court judge orders the inpatient examination, the political subdivision shall pay the costs of the examination.

#### Section 8-291.05. Misdemeanor charges; dismissal; notice

A. If the court finds that a juvenile has been adjudicated incompetent to stand trial within the past year, the court may hold a hearing to dismiss any misdemeanor charge against the juvenile if the juvenile continues to be incompetent to stand trial.  The court shall give ten days' notice of the hearing to the prosecutor and the juvenile.  On receipt of this notice, the prosecutor shall notify the victim of the hearing.

B. If a misdemeanor charge is dismissed pursuant to this section, the court may order the initiation of civil commitment proceedings or may appoint a guardian ad litem to proceed with a dependency investigation.

A. The privilege against self-incrimination applies to any examination or to any statement that is made to restoration personnel during the course and scope of a court ordered restoration program.

B. Any evidence or statement that is obtained during an examination or any evidence or statement that is made to restoration personnel during the course and scope of a restoration program is not admissible in any proceeding to determine the juvenile's guilt or innocence unless the juvenile presents evidence that is intended to rebut the presumption of sanity.

C. Any statement that a juvenile makes during any examination, any statement that a juvenile makes to restoration personnel during the course and scope of a restoration program or any evidence resulting from the statement concerning any other event or transaction is not admissible in any proceeding to determine the juvenile's guilt or innocence of any other charges that are based on those events or transactions.

D. Any statement that the juvenile makes during an examination, any part of the evaluations that is obtained during an examination or any statements that the juvenile makes to restoration personnel during the course and scope of a restoration program may not be used for any purpose without either:

5. For use by a mental health treatment provider that provides treatment to the juvenile or that assesses the juvenile for treatment.

6. For data gathering.

7. For scientific study.

F. If the court orders reports to be open for the purposes of statistical analysis, data gathering or scientific study pursuant to subsection E of this section, the reports shall be anonymous.

C. Except as provided in section 8-323, the county attorney has sole discretion to decide whether to divert or defer prosecution of a juvenile offender.

F. If the county attorney diverts the prosecution of a juvenile to the juvenile court, the juvenile probation officer shall conduct a personal interview with the alleged juvenile offender.  At least one of the juvenile's parents or guardians shall attend the interview.  The probation officer may waive the requirement for the attendance of the parent or guardian for good cause.

The resolution of the program is not a conviction of crime, does not impose any civil disabilities ordinarily resulting from a conviction and does not disqualify the juvenile in any civil service application or appointment.

H. In order to participate in a community based alternative program the juvenile who is referred to a program shall admit responsibility for the essential elements of the accusation and shall cooperate with the program in all of its proceedings.

I. All of the following apply to each community based alternative program that is established pursuant to this section:

1. The juvenile's participation is voluntary.

M. If the juvenile successfully completes the consequences, the county attorney shall not file a petition in juvenile court and the program's resolution shall not be used against the juvenile in any further proceeding and is not an adjudication of incorrigibility or delinquency.  The resolution of the program is not a conviction of crime, does not impose any civil disabilities ordinarily resulting from a conviction and does not disqualify the juvenile in any civil service application or appointment.

N. The county attorney or juvenile court shall assess the parent of a juvenile who is diverted pursuant to subsection A of this section a fee of fifty dollars unless, after determining the inability of the parent to pay the fee, the county attorney or juvenile court assesses a lesser amount.  If the juvenile was adopted or placed in permanent guardianship after the juvenile was determined by the court to be a dependent child, the county attorney or juvenile court shall consider the totality of the child's circumstances and the nature of the dependency. The county attorney or juvenile court may waive all or part of the fee prescribed by this subsection if the county attorney or juvenile court determines extenuating circumstances exist.  All monies assessed pursuant to this subsection shall be used for the administration and support of community based alternative programs or juvenile court diversion programs.  Any amount greater than forty dollars of the fee assessed pursuant to this subsection shall only be used to supplement monies currently used for the salaries of juvenile probation and surveillance officers and for support of programs and services of the superior court juvenile probation departments.  The clerk of the superior court shall pay all monies collected from this assessment to the county treasurer for deposit in the juvenile probation fund, to be utilized as provided in section 12-268, and the county attorney shall pay all monies collected from this assessment into the county attorney juvenile diversion fund established by section 11-537.

O. The supreme court shall annually establish an average cost per juvenile for providing diversion services in each county, based on the monies appropriated for diversion pursuant to section 8-322, excluding the cost of juvenile intake services provided by the juvenile court, and the number of juveniles diverted the previous year.  On the county attorney's certification to the supreme court of the number of juveniles diverted to a county attorney community based alternative program each quarter, the annual average cost per juvenile for each juvenile diverted shall be reimbursed to the county attorney juvenile diversion fund established by section 11-537 out of monies appropriated to the supreme court for diversion programs.

P. If the juvenile does not acknowledge responsibility for the offense, or fails to comply with the consequences set by the community based alternative program, the case shall be submitted to the county attorney for review.

Q. After reviewing a referral, if the county attorney declines prosecution, the county attorney may return the case to the juvenile probation department for further action as provided in subsection F of this section.

The number of hours to be spent working shall be set by the court based on the severity of the offense but shall not be less than sixteen hours.

K. If a juvenile is committed to the department of juvenile corrections, the court shall specify the amount of the monetary assessment imposed pursuant to subsection G or H of this section.

1. The person is not progressing toward treatment goals.

2. The person terminates treatment.

3. The person commits a new offense after reaching eighteen years of age.

The court shall credit community restitution performed at a rate that is equal to the minimum wage prescribed by section 23-363, subsections A and B, rounded up to the nearest dollar. If the juvenile is convicted of a second or subsequent violation of section 13-1602, subsection A, paragraph 5 and is ordered to perform community restitution, the court may order the parent or guardian of the juvenile to assist the juvenile in the performance of the community restitution if both of the following apply:

A. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state, except that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law.  The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.

1. Remedial training and technical assistance as directed by the interstate commission.

2. Alternative dispute resolution.

3. Fines, fees and costs in such amounts as are deemed to be reasonable as fixed by the interstate commission.

4. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact. Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted and the interstate commission has therefore determined that the offending state is in default.  Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the interstate commission to the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council.  The grounds for default include, but are not limited to, failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, the bylaws or duly promulgated rules and any other grounds designated in commission bylaws and rules.  The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default.  The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default.  If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination.

H. The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the interstate commission and the defaulting state.

I. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.

J. The interstate commission, by majority vote of the members, may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default.  In the event judicial enforcement is necessary the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation, including reasonable attorney fees.

K. The compact dissolves effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state.  Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact becomes null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the interstate commission shall be wound up and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws.

ARTICLE XII

(a) Undertake working with and accompanying the minor or vulnerable adult victim through all proceedings, including delinquency, civil and dependency proceedings.

(b) Communicate with the minor or vulnerable adult victim.

3. The representative's training, if any, to serve as a minor or vulnerable adult victim's representative.

4. The likelihood of the representative being called as a witness in the case.

E. The minor or vulnerable adult victim's representative shall accompany the minor or vulnerable adult victim through all proceedings, including delinquency, criminal, dependency and civil proceedings, and, before the minor's or vulnerable adult's courtroom appearance, shall explain to the minor or vulnerable adult the nature of the proceedings and what the minor or vulnerable adult will be asked to do, including telling the minor or vulnerable adult that the minor or vulnerable adult is expected to tell the truth. The representative shall be available to observe the minor or vulnerable adult in all aspects of the case in order to consult with the court as to any special needs of the minor or vulnerable adult.

4. A lawful representative of the legal entity has the right, if present, to be heard at any proceeding relating to restitution or disposition of the delinquent.

#### Section 8-385.01. Victims' rights for neighborhood associations

A. A neighborhood association may register with the city, town or county in which the neighborhood association is located to invoke the rights that are afforded pursuant to this article. The city, town or county shall establish procedures for the registration of neighborhood associations pursuant to this section. The procedures shall require the neighborhood association to provide to the city, town or county the name and telephone number of one person who shall act on behalf of the neighborhood association and who may receive notice or invoke rights pursuant to this section. The neighborhood association shall notify the city, town or county of any changes to this information. If the neighborhood association fails to keep this information current, the neighborhood association is deemed to have waived its rights under this section.

B. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, if a juvenile commits an act that if committed by an adult would be a crime under section 13-1602, subsection A, paragraph 5, section 13-3102, subsection A, paragraph 9, section 13-3201 or 13-3204, section 13-3208, subsection B or section 13-3209, 13-3405, 13-3407, 13-3408, 13-3421 or 13-4702, a neighborhood association that is registered with a city, town or county pursuant to subsection A of this section may receive notice or may invoke rights pursuant to the following sections:

The law enforcement agency shall fill out the form prescribed by section 8-386. Thereafter the neighborhood association, through the contact person, shall be afforded all of the rights listed under subsection B of this section.

 

#### Section 8-386. Information provided to victim by law enforcement agencies

A. As soon after the detection of an offense as the victim may be contacted without interfering with an investigation or arrest, the law enforcement agency responsible for investigating the offense shall provide electronic forms, pamphlets, information cards or other materials to the victim:

1. That allows the victim to request or waive applicable rights to which the victim is entitled, on request, under this article.

2. That provides the victim a method to designate a lawful representative if the victim so chooses pursuant to section 8-384, subsection A or section 8-385.

3. That provides notice to the victim of all of the following information:

A.

After the victim requests a reexamination proceeding and after the court gives reasonable notice, the court shall afford the victim a reexamination proceeding to consider the issues raised by the denial of the victim's right. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, the court shall reconsider any decision that arises from a proceeding in which the victim's right was not protected and shall ensure that the victim's rights are thereafter protected.

B. The failure to use reasonable efforts to perform a duty or provide a right is not cause to seek to set aside an adjudication or disposition after trial.  Failure to afford a right under this chapter shall not provide grounds for a new trial. A victim who was given notice of a plea or sentencing proceeding may make a motion to reopen a plea or sentence only if the victim was not voluntarily absent from the proceeding and has asserted the right to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue and the right to be heard was denied and, in the case of a plea, the accused has not pled to the highest offense charged.  This subsection does not affect the victim's right to restitution, which the victim may seek to enforce at any time.

C. Unless the juvenile is discharged from the juvenile's sentence, the failure to use reasonable efforts to provide notice and a right to be present or be heard pursuant to this chapter at a proceeding that involves a postadjudication release is a ground for the victim to seek to set aside the postadjudication release until the victim is afforded the opportunity to be present or be heard.

D. If the victim seeks to have a postadjudication release set aside pursuant to subsection C of this section, the court or department of juvenile corrections shall afford the victim a reexamination proceeding after the parties are given notice.

E. A reexamination proceeding conducted pursuant to this section or any other proceeding that is based on the failure to perform a duty or provide a right shall commence not more than thirty days after the appropriate parties have been given notice that the victim is exercising the right to a reexamination proceeding pursuant to this section or to another proceeding based on the failure to perform a duty or provide a right.

1. That the parent has abandoned the child.

2. That the parent has neglected or wilfully abused a child.  This abuse includes serious physical or emotional injury or situations in which the parent knew or reasonably should have known that a person was abusing or neglecting a child.

3. That the parent is unable to discharge parental responsibilities because of mental illness, mental deficiency or a history of chronic abuse of dangerous drugs, controlled substances or alcohol and there are reasonable grounds to believe that the condition will continue for a prolonged indeterminate period.

4. That the parent is deprived of civil liberties due to the conviction of a felony if the felony of which that parent was convicted is of such nature as to prove the unfitness of that parent to have future custody and control of the child, including murder of another child of the parent, manslaughter of another child of the parent or aiding or abetting or attempting, conspiring or soliciting to commit murder or manslaughter of another child of the parent, or if the sentence of that parent is of such length that the child will be deprived of a normal home for a period of years.

6. That the putative father failed to file a notice of claim of paternity as prescribed in section 8-106.01.

7. That the parents have relinquished their rights to a child to an agency or have consented to the adoption.

8. That the child is being cared for in an out-of-home placement under the supervision of the juvenile court, the division or a licensed child welfare agency, that the agency responsible for the care of the child has made a diligent effort to provide appropriate reunification services and that one of the following circumstances exists:

(a) The child has been in an out-of-home placement for a cumulative total period of nine months or longer pursuant to court order or voluntary placement pursuant to section 8-806 and the parent has substantially neglected or wilfully refused to remedy the circumstances that cause the child to be in an out-of-home placement.

(b) The child who is under three years of age has been in an out-of-home placement for a cumulative total period of six months or longer pursuant to court order and the parent has substantially neglected or wilfully refused to remedy the circumstances that cause the child to be in an out-of-home placement, including refusal to participate in reunification services offered by the department.

(c) The child has been in an out-of-home placement for a cumulative total period of fifteen months or longer pursuant to court order or voluntary placement pursuant to section 8-806, the parent has been unable to remedy the circumstances that cause the child to be in an out-of-home placement and there is a substantial likelihood that the parent will not be capable of exercising proper and effective parental care and control in the near future.

9. That the identity of the parent is unknown and continues to be unknown following three months of diligent efforts to identify and locate the parent.

10. That the parent has had parental rights to another child terminated within the preceding two years for the same cause and is currently unable to discharge parental responsibilities due to the same cause.

11. That all of the following are true:

(a) The child was cared for in an out-of-home placement pursuant to court order.

(b) The agency responsible for the care of the child made diligent efforts to provide appropriate reunification services.

12. Clear and convincing evidence that the parent committed a sexual assault against the petitioning parent and the child was conceived as a result of the sexual assault.  If the parent who is the subject of the petition pleads guilty to or is convicted of a violation of section 13-1406 or a violation of an offense in another jurisdiction that if committed in this state would be a violation of section 13-1406, the court may accept the guilty plea or conviction as evidence that the child was conceived as a result of a sexual assault by that parent.  For the purposes of this paragraph:

(a) "Oral sexual contact" has the same meaning prescribed in section 13-1401.

(b) "Sexual assault" means intentionally or knowingly engaging in sexual intercourse or oral sexual contact with a person without the consent of that person.

(c) "Sexual intercourse" has the same meaning prescribed in section 13-1401.

C. Evidence considered by the court pursuant to subsection B of this section shall include any substantiated allegations of abuse or neglect committed in another jurisdiction.

E. In considering the grounds for termination prescribed in subsection B, paragraph 8 of this section, the court shall not consider the first sixty days of the initial out-of-home placement pursuant to section 8-806 in the cumulative total period.

(d) Appropriate jurisdictional arrangements for the care of children will be promoted.

ARTICLE II. DEFINITIONS

As used in this compact:

(d) "Placement" means the arrangement for the care of a child in a family free or boarding home or in a child-caring agency or institution but does not include any institution caring for the mentally ill, mentally defective or epileptic or any institution primarily educational in character, and any hospital or other medical facility.

ARTICLE III. CONDITIONS FOR PLACEMENT

(a) No sending agency shall send, bring, or cause to be sent or brought into any other party state any child for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption unless the sending agency shall comply with each and every requirement set forth in this article and with the applicable laws of the receiving state governing the placement of children therein.

(b) Prior to sending, bringing or causing any child to be sent or brought into a receiving state for placement in foster care or as a preliminary to a possible adoption, the sending agency shall furnish the appropriate public authorities in the receiving state written notice of the intention to send, bring, or place the child in the receiving state. The notice shall contain:

(1) The name, date and place of birth of the child.

ARTICLE IV. PENALTY FOR ILLEGAL PLACEMENT

The sending, bringing, or causing to be sent or brought into any receiving state of a child in violation of the terms of this compact shall constitute a violation of the laws respecting the placement of children of both the state in which the sending agency is located or from which it sends or brings the child and of the receiving state. Such violation may be punished or subjected to penalty in either jurisdiction in accordance with its laws. In addition to liability for any such punishment or penalty, any such violation shall constitute full and sufficient grounds for the suspension or revocation of any license, permit, or other legal authorization held by the sending agency which empowers or allows it to place, or care for children.

ARTICLE V. RETENTION OF JURISDICTION

(a) The sending agency shall retain jurisdiction over the child sufficient to determine all matters in relation to the custody, supervision, care, treatment and disposition of the child which it would have had if the child had remained in the sending agency's state, until the child is adopted, reaches majority, becomes self-supporting or is discharged with the concurrence of the appropriate authority in the receiving state. Such jurisdiction shall also include the power to effect or cause the return of the child or its transfer to another location and custody pursuant to law. The sending agency shall continue to have financial responsibility for support and maintenance of the child during the period of the placement. Nothing contained herein shall defeat a claim of jurisdiction by a receiving state sufficient to deal with an act of delinquency or crime committed therein.

(b) When the sending agency is a public agency, it may enter into an agreement with an authorized public or private agency in the receiving state providing for the performance of one or more services in respect of such case by the latter as agent for the sending agency.

(c) Nothing in this compact shall be construed to prevent a private charitable agency authorized to place children in the receiving state from performing services or acting as agent in that state for a private charitable agency of the sending state; nor to prevent the agency in the receiving state from discharging financial responsibility for the support and maintenance of a child who has been placed on behalf of the sending agency without relieving the responsibility set forth in paragraph (a) hereof.

ARTICLE VI. INSTITUTIONAL CARE OF DELINQUENT CHILDREN

A child adjudicated delinquent may be placed in an institution in another party jurisdiction pursuant to this compact, but no such placement shall be made unless the child is given a court hearing on notice to the parent or guardian with opportunity to be heard, prior to his being sent to such other party jurisdiction for institutional care and the court finds that:

1. Equivalent facilities for the child are not available in the sending agency's jurisdiction; and

2. Institutional care in the other jurisdiction is in the best interest of the child and will not produce undue hardship.

ARTICLE VII. COMPACT ADMINISTRATOR

The executive head of each jurisdiction party to this compact shall designate an officer who shall be general coordinator of activities under this compact in his jurisdiction and who, acting jointly with like officers of other party jurisdictions, shall have power to promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this compact.

Withdrawal of a party state shall not affect the rights, duties and obligations under this compact of any sending agency therein with respect to a placement made prior to the effective date of withdrawal.

ARTICLE X. CONSTRUCTION AND SEVERABILITY

The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof. The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.

#### Section 8-845. Disposition hearing

A. After receiving and considering the evidence on the proper disposition of the case, the court may place a dependent child in the care of the child's parents, subject to the supervision of the department. If placement with the child's parents is contrary to the child's welfare, the court may place the child as follows in accordance with the child's best interests:

1. With a grandparent or another member of the child's extended family, including a person who has a significant relationship with the child.

2. In a licensed foster home.

3. In an appropriate public or private agency licensed to care for children.

4. In a suitable school.

5. In the independent living program established pursuant to section 8-521.

6. With any adult as a permanent guardian pursuant to article 12 of this chapter.

B. In reviewing the status of the child and in determining its order of disposition, the court shall consider the health and safety of the child as a paramount concern and the following criteria:

1. The goals of the placement and the appropriateness of the case plan.

2. The services that have been offered to reunite the family.

3. If returning the child home is not likely, the efforts that have been or should be made to evaluate or plan for other permanent placement plans.

4. The efforts that have been made or should be made to place the child with the child's siblings or to provide frequent visitation or contact when placement with siblings has not been possible.

C. The court shall review the permanent plan that has been established for the child. In reviewing the status of the child, the court, insofar as possible, shall seek to reunite the family. If the court does not order reunification of the family, the court shall order a plan of adoption or another permanent plan that is in the child's best interest and that takes into consideration the placement of the child with siblings or that provides for frequent visitation or contact between siblings unless the court determines that either the placement with the siblings or the visitation or contact would be contrary to the child's or a sibling's safety or well-being. If the court finds that an aggravating circumstance described in section 8-846, subsection D, paragraph 1 exists, the department shall file a motion for termination of parental rights within ten business days after the date of the court order, unless termination of parental rights is not in the best interests of the child.

D. Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, reasonable efforts to place a child for adoption may be made concurrently with reasonable efforts to reunify the family.

#### Section 8-846. Services provided to the child and family

A. Except as provided in subsections D, E and F of this section, if the child has been removed from the home, the court shall order the department to make reasonable efforts to provide services to the child and the child's parent.

B. If the court determines that services supplemental to those provided through the department are available from another source at no cost to this state, the court may order the services on agreement of the provider.

C. The court may employ an individual or individuals to facilitate collaboration between the parties and to ensure the delivery of court-ordered services.  An employee acting in that capacity has access to all documents and information necessary to ensure service delivery regarding the child and the child's family without obtaining prior approval from the child, the child's family or the court. The employee may disclose documents and information the employee acquires, reviews or produces only as prescribed pursuant to section 8-807.

D. The court shall consider the following factors in determining whether reunification services are required to be provided. Reunification services are not required to be provided if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that: 

1. One or more of the following aggravating circumstances exist:

(a) A party to the action provides a verified affidavit that states that a reasonably diligent search has failed to identify and locate the parent within three months after the filing of the dependency petition or the parent has expressed no interest in reunification with the child for at least three months after the filing of the dependency petition.

(b) The parent or guardian is suffering from a mental illness or mental deficiency of such magnitude that it renders the parent or guardian incapable of benefitting from the reunification services. This finding shall be based on competent evidence from a psychologist or physician that establishes that, even with the provision of reunification services, the parent or guardian is unlikely to be capable of adequately caring for the child within twelve months after the date of the child's removal from the home.

(c) The child previously has been removed and adjudicated dependent due to physical or sexual abuse. After the adjudication the child was returned to the custody of the parent or guardian and then subsequently removed within eighteen months due to additional physical or sexual abuse.

(d) The parent or guardian committed an act that constitutes a dangerous crime against children as defined in section 13-705 or caused a child to suffer serious physical injury or emotional injury or the parent or guardian knew or reasonably should have known that another person committed an act that constitutes a dangerous crime against children as defined in section 13-705 or caused a child to suffer serious physical injury or emotional injury.

(e) The parent's rights to another child have been terminated, the parent has not successfully addressed the issues that led to the termination and the parent is unable to discharge parental responsibilities.

(f) After a finding that a child is dependent, all of the following are true:

(i) A child has been removed from the parent or guardian on at least two previous occasions.

(ii) Reunification services were offered or provided to the parent or guardian after the removal.

(iii) The parent or guardian is unable to discharge parental responsibilities.

(g) A child who is currently under six months of age was exposed to a drug or substance as described in section 8-201, paragraph 25, subdivision (c) and both of the following are true:

(i) The parent of the child is unable to discharge parental responsibilities because of a history of chronic abuse of dangerous drugs or controlled substances.

(ii) Reasonable grounds exist to believe that the parent's condition will continue for a prolonged or indeterminate period based on a competent opinion from a licensed health care provider with experience in the area of substance abuse disorders. For the purposes of this item "licensed health care provider" means a physician licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17, a psychologist licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 19.1, a nurse practitioner licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 15 whose population foci include psychiatric-mental health and a licensed independent substance abuse counselor licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 33.

2. The parent or guardian of a child has been convicted of a dangerous crime against children as defined in section 13-705, murder or manslaughter of a child, or of sexual abuse of a child, sexual assault of a child, sexual conduct with a minor, molestation of a child, commercial sexual exploitation of a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor or luring a minor for sexual exploitation.

E. The court shall consider any criminal prosecution relating to the offenses that led to the child's removal from the home and shall abide by any orders of the criminal court.  Information may be provided by law enforcement or the county attorney.

F. If a dependency petition was filed pursuant to section 8-873.01 or 8-874, subsection J, the court may direct the division not to provide reunification services to the child's parents unless the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that these services would be in the child's best interests.

#### Section 8-847. Periodic review hearings

A. After the disposition hearing, the court shall hold periodic review hearings at least once every six months as required by federal law.

B. At a proceeding to review the disposition orders of the court, the court shall provide the following persons notice of the review and the right to participate in the proceeding:

1. The authorized agency charged with the child's care and custody.

2. Any foster parents in whose home the child resided within the last six months or resides at present, except for those foster parents who maintain a receiving foster home where the child has resided for ten days or less.  The petitioner shall provide the court with the names and addresses of all foster parents who are entitled to notice pursuant to statute.

3. A shelter care facility or receiving foster home where the child resides or has resided within the last six months for more than ten days.  The petitioner shall provide the court with the names and addresses of all shelter care facilities and receiving foster homes that are entitled to notice pursuant to this paragraph.

E. At any periodic review hearing the court shall determine:

1. Whether the department has identified and assessed placement of the child with a relative or person who has a significant relationship with the child.

2. Whether the parent or guardian has complied with the court order pursuant to section 8-824, subsection D, paragraph 6 or section 8-842 subsection B, paragraph 1.

F. If the court finds that a child is no longer dependent, before it dismisses the proceeding the court shall provide notice of the sibling information exchange program established pursuant to section 8-543 to the following:

1. An adult who is the former dependent child in the proceeding for whom the periodic review hearing is held.

2. A parent or guardian with legal custody of the former dependent child for whom the periodic review hearing is held.

 

### Article 11 - Permanency Determination

#### Section 8-861. Return of child

After the temporary custody hearing, on request of a parent or guardian the court shall order that the child be returned to the child's parent or guardian if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the return of the child would not create a substantial risk of harm to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or safety.  The court shall consider the failure of the parent or guardian to comply with the terms of the case plan as evidence that return of the child would create a substantial risk of harm to the child.

#### Section 8-862. Permanency hearing

A. The court shall hold a permanency hearing to determine the future permanent legal status of the child:

1. Within thirty days after the disposition hearing if the court does not order reunification services.

2. Within six months after a child who is under three years of age is removed from the child's home.  The court shall not continue that permanency hearing beyond six months after the child who is under three years of age is removed from the child's home unless the party who is seeking the continuance shows that the determination prescribed in section 8-829, subsection A, paragraph 6 has been made or will be made within the time prescribed in that paragraph.

3. In all other cases, within twelve months after the child is removed from the child's home.  The court shall not continue the permanency hearing beyond twelve months after the child is removed from the child's home unless the party who is seeking the continuance shows that the determination prescribed in section 8-829, subsection A, paragraph 5 has been made or will be made within the time prescribed in that paragraph.

B. At the permanency hearing, the court shall determine:

1. Whether termination of parental rights, adoption, permanent guardianship pursuant to section 8-872 or some other permanent legal status is the most appropriate plan for the child and shall order the plan to be accomplished within a specified period of time.

2. Whether reasonable efforts have been made to finalize the permanency plan in effect.

3. What efforts have been made in the permanency plan to place the child with the child's siblings or to provide frequent visitation or contact, unless the court had already determined that placement with all or any siblings or visitation or contact is not possible or would be contrary to the child's or a sibling's safety or well-being.

C. If the court determines that the child should remain in out-of-home placement longer than eighteen months from the date of the permanency order, the court shall conduct a review of the order at least once each year. After reviewing the order, the court may reaffirm the order or direct other disposition of the child.

D. If the court determines that the termination of parental rights is clearly in the best interests of the child, the court shall:

1. Order the department or the child's attorney or guardian ad litem to file within ten days after the permanency hearing a motion alleging one or more of the grounds prescribed in section 8-533 for termination of parental rights.  The party who files the motion has the burden of presenting evidence at the termination hearing to prove the allegations in the motion.

2. Set a date for an initial hearing on the motion for termination of parental rights within thirty days after the permanency hearing. If the termination is contested at the initial hearing, the court shall set a date for the trial on termination of parental rights within ninety days after the permanency hearing.

E. The department shall make reasonable efforts to place the child in a timely manner in accordance with the permanency plan and to complete whatever steps are necessary to finalize the permanent placement of the child.

F. If the court determines that permanent guardianship is clearly in the best interests of the child, the court shall:

1. Order the department or the child's attorney or guardian ad litem to file within ten days after the permanency hearing a motion alleging the grounds prescribed in section 8-871 for permanent guardianship. The party who files the motion has the burden of presenting evidence at the hearing to prove the allegations in the motion.

2. Set a date for an initial hearing on the motion for permanent guardianship within thirty days after the permanency hearing. If the permanent guardianship is contested at the initial hearing, the court shall set a date for the trial on the permanent guardianship within ninety days after the permanency hearing.

G. Evidence considered by the court in making a decision pursuant to this section also shall include any substantiated allegations of abuse or neglect committed in another jurisdiction.

H. If the court determines that termination of parental rights or permanent guardianship is clearly in the best interest of the child and the child has been placed in a prospective permanent placement, unless the action is required by federal law, state law or regulation, any action that is inconsistent with the case plan of severance and adoption, including removal of the child from that placement, may occur only by court order or if the prospective permanent placement requests the child's removal. If a motion to change the case plan or for removal of a child is filed, a copy of the motion must be provided to the prospective permanent placement at least fifteen days before a hearing on the motion. If the prospective permanent placement does not appear at a hearing on a motion for removal, the court may not take any action on the motion unless the court finds that good faith efforts were made to provide a copy of the motion to the prospective permanent placement.  The prospective permanent placement has the right to be heard in the proceeding. This right does not require that the prospective permanent placement be made a party to the proceeding solely on the basis of that right. This subsection does not apply to any removal pursuant to section 8-456 or 8-821.  If the child is an Indian child as defined pursuant to the Indian child welfare act (25 United States Code section 1903), the court and the parties must comply with all applicable requirements of that act. For the purposes of this subsection, a prospective permanent placement includes:

1. A grandparent or another member of the child's extended family including a person who has a significant relationship with the child.

2. A person or persons with an expressed interest in being the permanent placement for the child in a certified adoptive home where the child resides, a home that is a permanent placement for a sibling of the child or a licensed family foster home where the child resides.

I. This section does not prevent the department from presenting for the court's consideration a grandparent or another member of the child’s extended family including a person who has a significant relationship with the child and who has not been identified as a prospective permanent placement for the child before the child's placement with a prospective permanent placement.

 

#### Section 8-863. Hearing to terminate parental rights; notice; grounds

A. At least ten days before the initial hearing on the termination of parental rights pursuant to this article, the party who is responsible for filing a motion pursuant to section 8-862, subsection D shall serve the motion on all parties as prescribed in rule 5(c) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure, including any person who has filed a petition to adopt or who has physical custody pursuant to a court order in a foster-adoptive placement.

B. The court may terminate the parental rights of a parent if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence one or more of the grounds prescribed in section 8-533.

C. If a parent does not appear at the hearing, the court, after determining that the parent has been served as provided in subsection A of this section, may find that the parent has waived the parent's legal rights and is deemed to have admitted the allegations of the petition by the failure to appear. The court may terminate the parent-child relationship as to a parent who does not appear based on the record and evidence presented as provided in rules prescribed by the supreme court.

D. Sections 8-538 and 8-539 apply to orders of termination issued pursuant to this section.

#### Section 8-864. Timing of motions and hearings; consolidation of hearings

Notwithstanding any other statute, the court may order or permit the filing of a motion for termination or permanent guardianship before the permanency hearing is held, consolidate hearings or provide for a different order of hearings if:

1. The permanency hearing is held no later than the time prescribed in section 8-862, subsection A.

2. The termination hearing is held no later than the time prescribed in section 8-862, subsection D, paragraph 2.

3. The permanent guardianship hearing is held no later than the time prescribed in section 8-862, subsection F, paragraph 2.

 

### Article 12 - Permanent Guardianship

#### Section 8-871. Permanent guardianship of a child

A. The court may establish a permanent guardianship between a child and the guardian if the prospective guardianship is in the child's best interests and all of the following apply:

1. The child has been adjudicated a dependent child or is the subject of a pending dependency petition. If the child has not been adjudicated dependent, all parties have been served pursuant to section 8-872, subsection B and no party objects, the court may grant a permanent guardianship. If the child has not been adjudicated dependent and any party objects to a motion for permanent guardianship, the court may schedule a settlement conference or mediation or may strike the motion and proceed with the dependency petition.

2. The child has been in the custody of the prospective permanent guardian for at least nine months. The court may waive this requirement for good cause.

3. If the child is in the custody of the department or agency, the department or agency has made reasonable efforts to reunite the parent and child and further efforts would be unproductive.  The court may waive this requirement if it finds one or more of the following:

(a) Reunification efforts are not required by law.

(b) Reunification of the parent and child is not in the child's best interests because the parent is unwilling or unable to properly care for the child.

(c) The child is the subject of a pending dependency petition and there has been no adjudication of dependency.

4. The likelihood that the child would be adopted is remote or termination of parental rights would not be in the child's best interests.

B. If the child is the subject of a pending dependency petition not filed by the department, the court shall notify the department of the motion for permanent guardianship not later than fourteen court days after the motion is filed, and the department may conduct an investigation into the allegations contained in the dependency petition. The department shall have ten court days from the court's notification to inform the court and parties of its position on the guardianship. If the department objects to the motion, the department may take action necessary to protect the health and safety of the child who is the subject of the guardianship motion, including moving to intervene in the dependency action or filing a separate dependency petition. The department, the agency or a person designated as an officer of the court shall provide a guardianship report pursuant to section 8-872, subsection E to the court not later than ten days following the court's order to provide the report.

C. The court may consider any adult, including a relative or foster parent, as a permanent guardian. An agency or institution may not be a permanent guardian. The court may appoint a person nominated by the child if the child is at least twelve years of age, unless the court finds that the appointment would not be in the child's best interests. The court shall consider the child's objection to the appointment of the person nominated as permanent guardian.

D. In proceedings for permanent guardianship, the court shall give primary consideration to the physical, mental and emotional needs and safety of the child.

E. Unless otherwise set forth in the final order of permanent guardianship, a permanent guardian is vested with all of the rights and responsibilities set forth in section 14-5209 relating to the powers and duties of a guardian of a minor, other than those rights and responsibilities of the birth or adoptive parent, if any, that are set forth in the decree of permanent guardianship.

F. At the guardianship hearing, or by notice filed after the appointment of a permanent guardian or a successor permanent guardian pursuant to section 8-874, the guardian may advise the court as to the identity and contact information of potential successor permanent guardians.

G. The department or agency shall not be responsible for the requirements pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section for a petition concerning a child who is not in the care, custody and control of the department or agency.

 

#### Section 8-872. Permanent guardianship; procedure

A. Any party to a dependency proceeding or a pending dependency proceeding may file a motion for permanent guardianship. The motion shall be verified by the person who files the motion and shall include the following:

1. The name, sex, residence and date and place of birth of the child.

2. The facts and circumstances supporting the grounds for permanent guardianship.

3. The name and address of the prospective guardian and a statement that the prospective guardian agrees to accept the duties and responsibilities of guardianship.

4. The basis for the court's jurisdiction.

5. The relationship of the child to the prospective guardian.

6. Whether the child is subject to the Indian child welfare act of 1978 (P.L. 95-608; 92 Stat. 3069; 25 United States Code sections 1901 through 1963) and if so:

(a) The tribal affiliations of the child's parents.

(b) The specific actions the person who files the motion has taken to notify the parents' tribes and the results of those contacts, including the names, addresses, titles and telephone numbers of the persons contacted. The person shall attach to the motion as exhibits any correspondence with the tribes.

(c) The specific efforts that were made to comply with the placement preferences under the Indian child welfare act of 1978 or the placement preferences of the appropriate Indian tribes.

7. The name, address, marital status and date of birth of the birth parents, if known.

B. The person who files the motion shall serve notice of the hearing and a copy of the motion on all parties as prescribed in rule 5(c) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure, including any person who has filed a petition to adopt or who has physical custody pursuant to a court order in a foster-adoptive placement. In addition to the requirements of rule 5(c) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure, the notice shall be sent by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, to any parent, Indian custodian and tribe of an Indian child as defined in the Indian child welfare act of 1978 (25 United States Code section 1903).

C. The person who files the motion shall provide a copy of the notice of hearing to the following persons if the person has not been served pursuant to subsection B of this section:

1. The child's current physical custodian.

2. Any foster parent with whom the child has resided within six months before the date of the hearing.

3. The prospective guardian if the guardian is not the current physical custodian.

4. Any other person the court orders to be provided notice.

D. The court shall hold the guardianship adjudication hearing within ninety days after the initial guardianship hearing.

E. In a proceeding for permanent guardianship, on the request of a parent, the court shall appoint counsel for any parent found to be indigent if the parent is not already represented by counsel. The court may also appoint one for the child if a guardian ad litem has not already been appointed.

F. Before a final hearing, the department, the agency or a person designated as an officer of the court shall conduct an investigation addressing the factors set forth in section 8-871, whether the prospective permanent guardian or guardians are fit and proper persons to become permanent guardians and whether the best interests of the child would be served by granting the permanent guardianship. The findings of this investigation shall be set forth in a written report provided to the court and all parties before the hearing. The court may require additional investigation if it finds that the welfare of the child will be served or if additional information is necessary to make an appropriate decision regarding the permanent guardianship. The court may charge a reasonable fee for this investigation pursuant to section 8-133, if performed by an officer of the court. The court may waive the requirements of this subsection for good cause.

G. Before the court may appoint a guardian, the court shall require the prospective guardian to furnish either a valid fingerprint clearance card or a full set of fingerprints to enable the court to determine the applicant's suitability as guardian. If the prospective guardian does not submit a valid fingerprint clearance card, the prospective guardian shall submit a full set of fingerprints to the court for the purpose of obtaining a state and federal criminal records check pursuant to section 41-1750 and Public Law 92-544. The department of public safety may exchange this fingerprint data with the federal bureau of investigation.

H. The person who files the motion has the burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence. In any proceeding involving a child who is subject to the Indian child welfare act of 1978, the person who files the motion has the burden of proof by beyond a reasonable doubt.

I. A court order vesting permanent guardianship with an individual divests the birth or adoptive parent of legal custody of or guardianship for the child but does not terminate the parent's rights. A court order for permanent guardianship does not affect the child's inheritance rights from and through the child's birth or adoptive parents.

J. On finding that grounds exist for a permanent guardianship, the court may incorporate into the final order provisions for visitation with the natural parents, siblings or other relatives of the child if this order would be in the child's best interests and any other provision that is necessary to rehabilitate the child or to provide for the child's continuing safety and well-being. The court may order a parent to contribute to the support of the child to the extent it finds the parent is able.

K. On the entry of the order establishing a permanent guardianship, the dependency action shall be dismissed. If the child was in the legal custody of the department during the dependency, the court may order the department to conduct the investigation and prepare the report for the first report and review hearing. If the child was not in the legal custody of the department, the court may order the child's attorney or guardian ad litem to file a report for the report and review hearing. The court shall retain jurisdiction to enforce its final order of permanent guardianship. The court may order a report and shall set a review to be held within one year following the entry of the final order and may set such other and further proceedings as may be in the best interests of the child. Before a report and review hearing, the court may cause an investigation to be conducted of the facts and circumstances surrounding the welfare and best interests of the child and a written report to be filed with the court. The court may charge a reasonable fee for this investigation pursuant to section 8-133, if performed by an officer of the court.

L. The department or agency shall not be responsible for the requirements pursuant to subsections F, J and K of this section for a motion concerning a child not in the care, custody and control of the department or agency.

M. The court shall provide the guardian with written notice of the sibling information exchange program established pursuant to section 8-543.

 

#### Section 8-873. Revocation of permanent guardianship

A. The child, a parent of the child, the guardian of the child or any party to the dependency proceeding may file a petition for the revocation of an order granting permanent guardianship if there is a significant change of circumstances, including:

1. The child's parent is able and willing to properly care for the child.

2. The child's permanent guardian is unable to properly care for the child.

B. The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the child in any proceeding for the revocation of permanent guardianship.

C. The court may revoke the order granting permanent guardianship of a child who previously has been adjudicated a dependent child if the party petitioning for revocation proves a change of circumstances by clear and convincing evidence and the revocation is in the child's best interest.  When making this determination, the court shall consider all of the following:

1. The child's position on the revocation of the guardianship if the child is at least twelve years of age.

2. The duration of the guardianship and the level of contact between the parent and the child during the guardianship.

3. Any other relevant factor.

2. The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the parent has remedied the grounds alleged in the guardianship motion.

3. The court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the return of the child would not create a substantial risk of harm to the child's physical, mental or emotional health or safety. When making this determination, the court shall consider all of the following:

(a) The child's position on the revocation of the guardianship if the child is at least twelve years of age.

(b) The duration of the guardianship and the level of contact between the parent and the child during the guardianship.

(c) Any other relevant factor.

E. The court may set a case plan of guardianship after revocation of a permanent guardianship even though no successor guardian has been identified if the court has ordered that no reunification services be provided to the child's parent.

 

#### Section 8-873.01. Permanent guardianship dependency proceedings; reunification services

A. If a dependency petition is filed on a permanent guardian, the court shall order reunification services in the pending dependency proceeding for the parent whose child was previously adjudicated dependent resulting in the appointment of the permanent guardian if, after receiving notice, the parent meets all of the following:

1. Is willing to care for the child.

2. Makes a written or oral request to the court to participate in reunification services at the parent's initial appearance.

3. Proves by clear and convincing evidence that there has been a significant change of circumstances that indicates that the parent may be able to care for the child and that reunification services are in the child's best interests.

B.

C. If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that there has been a significant change of circumstances that indicates that the parent may be able to care for the child and that reunification services are in the child's best interests, the court shall order the department to provide reunification services to the parent.

 

#### Section 8-874. Appointment of successor permanent guardian

A. If a permanent guardian appointed pursuant to section 8-872 is unable or unwilling to continue to serve as permanent guardian, the permanent guardian, the division or an interested party may file a motion for appointment of a successor permanent guardian.  The motion shall be verified by the person filing the motion and shall include the following:

1. The name, sex, address and date and place of birth of each child who is the subject of the motion.

3. The reason why the permanent guardian is no longer able or willing to serve as permanent guardian of the child.

4. The name and address of the proposed successor permanent guardian, if any.

1. The relationship between the proposed successor permanent guardian and the child.

2. The proposed successor guardian's agreement to assume the duties and responsibilities of permanent guardian, including compliance with all court orders.

C. On the filing of a motion pursuant to subsection A of this section, the court shall:

1. Set a date for an initial guardianship review hearing within thirty days after the motion is filed.

2. Appoint an attorney for the child and appoint an attorney for the proposed successor guardian, if necessary. The court is not required to appoint an attorney for the parent of the child.

(b) Directing the division to complete a criminal records check and home study to determine the suitability of the proposed successor permanent guardian to serve as the permanent guardian of the child.

(c) Directing the division to conduct an investigation to determine whether dependency proceedings should be initiated.

E. If the child is at least twelve years of age, the court shall consider the child's objection to the proposed successor permanent guardian.

F. At the hearing, if the court finds that the proposed successor permanent guardian is suitable to assume the responsibilities of permanent guardian and that appointment would be in the child's best interests, the court shall grant the motion, terminate the appointment of the current permanent guardian and enter any other orders as may be necessary for the safety and well-being of the child, including:

1. Appointing the proposed successor permanent guardian as a provisional permanent guardian of the child for a period not to exceed nine months and setting a hearing to determine whether the appointment should be made permanent.

2.

1. Is willing to care for the child.

2. Makes a written or oral request to the court to participate in reunification services at the parent's initial appearance.

K. The court may order that the case plan of guardianship remain in place even though no successor guardian has been identified if the court has ordered that no reunification services be provided to the child's parent.

 

### Article 13 - Substance Abuse Treatment Assistance

#### Section 8-882. Program development

## Chapter 13 - EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH PROGRAMS

### Article 1 - General Provisions

#### Section 8-1151. Findings and declarations

(Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 applies)

 

A. The people of Arizona find that:

1. Early learning experiences directly impact a child's long-term educational success.  Research shows that that the majority of a child's brain structure is formed before age three and that the years between birth and kindergarten are when children develop many of their language skills, thought processes, self-confidence, discipline and values.

2. Health, vision and dental screenings that detect children's health problems early enable them to receive the care they need to grow and thrive.

3. Children entering school who have had high-quality early childhood developmental experiences, inside the home or in other settings of their parents' choice, are better able to succeed academically and have greater opportunities.

4. All Arizonans benefit from providing early childhood development opportunities for our children.  For children, such efforts give them a healthy start and an opportunity to succeed.  For parents, the availability and affordability of quality early childhood development programs helps them retain jobs and earn higher incomes.  For taxpayers, early development programs save tax dollars by lowering drop-out rates, reducing crime and cutting the cost of social services.

5. All Arizona children should begin school with the skills they need for long-term educational and personal success.

6. For these reasons, the people of Arizona find that providing dedicated funding to improve the quality, accessibility and affordability of early childhood development opportunities in the setting of the parents' choice should be one of the state's top priorities.

B. The people of Arizona therefore declare our intent to provide the necessary coordination and funding for early childhood development and health programs in Arizona that will:

1. Work with parents, community leaders, local governments, public and private entities and faith-based groups to improve the quality of and increase access to early childhood development programs in communities throughout the state.

2. Increase access to preventive health programs and health screenings.

3. Offer parents and families support and education about early child development and literacy.

4. Recognize the diversity of Arizona communities and give them a voice in identifying programs to address their particular needs.

5. Provide training and support to early childhood development providers.

6. Be subject to accountability and audit requirements, including requirements that the success of the board and regional partnerships, as well as the programs they undertake and fund, be measured by outcomes for children and families.

#### Section 8-1152. Definitions

(Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 applies)

 

In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Board" means the Arizona early childhood development and health board established by this chapter.
