Vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at the time the signal is exhibited.

(b) Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal, shown alone or in combination with another indication, may cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow or such other movement as is permitted by other indications shown at the same time. Vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within an adjacent crosswalk and to other traffic lawfully using the intersection.

A law enforcement officer or a jurisdiction issuing a citation to a person who violates this subdivision shall provide written notice to the person that if eligible, the person may attend defensive driving school or, if not eligible or if the person chooses not to attend defensive driving school and is found responsible or enters a plea of responsible for a violation of this subsection, the person must attend and successfully complete traffic survival school educational sessions. The notice shall include a reference to red light violations and state that if the person is required to attend traffic survival school the person will receive notice from the motor vehicle division.

A right turn may be prohibited against a red signal at any intersection if a sign prohibiting the turn is erected at the intersection.

(c) The driver of a vehicle on a one-way street that intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves to the left shall stop in obedience to a red signal but may then make a left turn into the one-way street.  The driver shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians and other traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at the intersection, except that such left turn may be prohibited if a sign prohibiting the turn is erected at the intersection.

(d) Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal as provided in section 28-646, a pedestrian facing a steady red signal alone shall not enter the roadway.

B. If an official traffic control signal is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, this section applies except as to those provisions of this section that by their nature can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of a sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

J. A timely request for a hearing stays the suspension until a hearing is held, except that the department shall not return any surrendered license or permit to the person but may issue temporary permits to drive that expire not later than when the department has made its final decision.  If the person is a resident without a license or permit or has an expired license or permit, the department may allow the person to apply for a restricted license or permit. If the department determines the person is otherwise entitled to the license or permit, the department shall issue and retain a restricted license or permit subject to this section.

K. Hearings requested under this section shall be conducted in the same manner and under the same conditions as provided in section 28-3306.  For the purposes of this section, the scope of the hearing shall include only the issues of whether:

Within thirty days after a suspension order is sustained, the affected person may file a petition in the superior court to review the final order of suspension or denial by the department in the same manner provided in section 28-3317.  The court shall hear the review of the final order of suspension or denial on an expedited basis.

N. If the suspension or determination that there should be a denial of issuance is not sustained, the ruling is not admissible in and has no effect on any administrative, civil or criminal court proceeding.

O. If it has been determined under the procedures of this section that a nonresident's privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this state has been suspended, the department shall give information either in writing or by electronic means of the action taken to the motor vehicle administrator of the state of the person's residence and of any state in which the person has a license.

P. After completing any alcohol or other drug screening that is ordered by the department pursuant to this chapter, a person whose driving privilege is suspended pursuant to this section may apply to the department for a special ignition interlock restricted driver license pursuant to section 28-1401. Unless the certified ignition interlock period is extended by the department pursuant to section 28-1461, a person who is issued a special ignition interlock restricted driver license as provided in this subsection shall maintain a functioning certified ignition interlock device in compliance with this chapter during the remaining period of the suspension prescribed by this section.  This subsection does not apply to a person whose driving privilege is suspended for a second or subsequent refusal within a period of eighty-four months.

Q. Notwithstanding section 28-1401, the department may issue a special ignition interlock restricted driver license to a person for an offense described in subsection A of this section.  A person who applies for and who is issued a special ignition interlock restricted driver license pursuant to this subsection agrees to the administrative action taken by the department against the person's license.  Once the department issues a special ignition interlock restricted driver license pursuant to this subsection, the person waives any right to an administrative hearing contesting the administrative action against the person's license pursuant to this section or section 28-1385.

#### Section 28-1322. Preliminary breath tests; rules on approval of devices

1. The test was performed using a quantitative breath testing device approved by the department of health services or the department of public safety. A properly authenticated certification by the department of health services or the department of public safety or judicial notice of department of health services or department of public safety rules is sufficient to establish this requirement.

2. The operator who conducted the test possessed a valid permit issued by the department of health services or the department of public safety to operate the device used to conduct the test.

3. Duplicate tests were administered and the test results were within 0.02 alcohol concentration of each other or an operator observed the person charged with the violation for twenty minutes immediately preceding the administration of the test.

1. If there was at that time 0.05 or less alcohol concentration in the defendant's blood, breath or other bodily substance, it may be presumed that the defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

2. If there was at that time in excess of 0.05 but less than 0.08 alcohol concentration in the defendant's blood, breath or other bodily substance, that fact shall not give rise to a presumption that the defendant was or was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor, but that fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.

3. If there was at that time 0.08 or more alcohol concentration in the defendant's blood, breath or other bodily substance, it may be presumed that the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

A. The court shall allow the allegation of a prior conviction or any other pending charge of a violation of section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383 or an act in another jurisdiction that if committed in this state would be a violation of section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383 filed twenty or more days before the date the case is actually tried and may allow the allegation of a prior conviction or any other pending charge of a violation of section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383 or an act in another jurisdiction that if committed in this state would be a violation of section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383 filed at any time before the date the case is actually tried if this state makes available to the defendant when the allegation is filed a copy of any information obtained concerning the prior conviction or other pending charge. Any conviction may be used to enhance another conviction irrespective of the dates on which the offenses occurred within the eighty-four month provision.  For the purposes of this article, an order of a juvenile court adjudicating a person delinquent is equivalent to a conviction.

B. In addition to any other penalties prescribed by law, the judge shall order a person who is convicted of a violation of section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383 to complete alcohol or other drug screening that is provided by a facility approved by the department of health services, the United States department of veterans affairs or a probation department.  If a judge determines that the person requires further alcohol or other drug education or treatment, the person may be required pursuant to court order to obtain alcohol or other drug education or treatment under the court's supervision from an approved facility. The judge may review an education or treatment determination at the request of the state, the defendant or the probation officer or on the judge's initiative. The person shall pay the costs of the screening, education or treatment unless, after considering the person's ability to pay all or part of the costs, the court waives all or part of the costs.  If a person is referred to a screening, education or treatment facility, the facility shall report to the court whether the person has successfully completed the screening, education or treatment program. The court may accept evidence of a person's completion of alcohol or other drug screening pursuant to section 28-1445 as sufficient to meet the requirements of this section or section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383 or may order the person to complete additional alcohol or other drug screening, education or treatment programs. If a person has previously been ordered to complete an alcohol or other drug screening, education or treatment program pursuant to this section, the judge shall order the person to complete an alcohol or other drug screening, education or treatment program unless the court determines that alternative sanctions are more appropriate.

C. After a person who is sentenced pursuant to section 28-1381, subsection I has served twenty-four consecutive hours in jail or after a person who is sentenced pursuant to section 28-1381, subsection K or section 28-1382, subsection D or E has served forty-eight consecutive hours in jail and after the court receives confirmation that the person is employed or is a student, the court shall provide in the sentence that the defendant, if the defendant is employed or is a student and can continue the defendant's employment or schooling, may continue the employment or schooling for not more than twelve hours a day nor more than six days a week, unless the court finds good cause to not allow the release and places those findings on the record.  The person shall spend the remaining day, days or parts of days in jail until the sentence is served and shall be allowed out of jail only long enough to complete the actual hours of employment or schooling.

D. Unless the license of a person convicted under section 28-1381 or 28-1382 has been or is suspended pursuant to section 28-1321 or 28-1385, the department on receipt of the abstract of conviction of a violation of section 28-1381 or 28-1382 shall suspend the license of the affected person for not less than ninety consecutive days.

E. When the department receives notification that the person meets the criteria provided in section 28-1385, subsection H, the department shall suspend the driving privileges of the person for not less than thirty consecutive days and shall restrict the person's driving privileges as described in section 28-144 for not less than sixty consecutive additional days.

F. If a person is placed on probation for violating section 28-1381 or 28-1382, the probation shall be supervised unless the court finds that supervised probation is not necessary or the court does not have supervisory probation services.

G. Any political subdivision processing or using the services of a person ordered to perform community restitution pursuant to section 28-1381 or 28-1382 does not incur any civil liability to the person ordered to perform community restitution as a result of these activities unless the political subdivision or its agent or employee acts with gross negligence.

H. The court may order alternative sanctions to community restitution that is ordered pursuant to section 28-1381, subsection K or section 28-1382, subsection E if the court determines that education, treatment or other alternative sanctions are more appropriate.

#### Section 28-1388. Blood and breath tests; violation; classification; admissible evidence

A. If blood is drawn under section 28-1321, only a physician, a registered nurse or another qualified person may withdraw blood for the purpose of determining the alcohol concentration or drug content in the blood. The qualifications of the individual withdrawing the blood and the method used to withdraw the blood are not foundational prerequisites for the admissibility of a blood alcohol content determination made pursuant to this subsection.

B. If a law enforcement officer administers a duplicate breath test and the person tested is given a reasonable opportunity to arrange for an additional test pursuant to subsection C of this section, a sample of the person's breath does not have to be collected or preserved.

C. The person tested shall be given a reasonable opportunity to arrange for any physician, registered nurse or other qualified person of the person's own choosing to administer a test or tests in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test by a person does not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.

D. If a person under arrest refuses to submit to a test or tests under section 28-1321, whether or not a sample was collected pursuant to subsection E of this section or a search warrant, evidence of refusal is admissible in any civil or criminal action or other proceeding. The issue of refusal is an issue of fact to be determined by the trier of fact in all cases.

E. Notwithstanding any other law, if a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a person has violated section 28-1381 and a sample of blood, urine or other bodily substance is taken from that person for any reason, a portion of that sample sufficient for analysis shall be provided to a law enforcement officer if requested for law enforcement purposes. A person who fails to comply with this subsection is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.

F. A person who collects blood, urine or any other bodily substance under this section or any hospital, laboratory or clinic employing or using the services of the person does not incur any civil liability as a result of this activity if requested by a law enforcement officer to collect blood, urine or other bodily substances unless the person, while performing the activity, acts with gross negligence.

G. A statement by the defendant that the defendant was driving a vehicle that was involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of any person is admissible in any criminal proceeding without further proof of corpus delicti if it is otherwise admissible.

#### Section 28-1389. Waiver of fine, surcharge or assessment

The court shall not waive a fine or assessment imposed pursuant to this article or a surcharge imposed pursuant to section 12-116.01 or 12-116.02 for a conviction of an offense listed in this article.

 

#### Section 28-1390. Emergency personnel; law enforcement

A. Notwithstanding any other law, if a law enforcement officer reasonably believes that a person may have violated section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383, the law enforcement officer may request emergency department personnel of a health care institution as defined in section 36-401 to provide to the law enforcement officer a copy of any written or electronic report of the person’s blood alcohol concentration.

B. Before requesting the information required by subsection A of this section, a law enforcement officer shall obtain permission from the emergency department director or the director’s designee to speak with the personnel.  The permission shall not be refused, but may be delayed if, in the opinion of the emergency department director or the director’s designee, taking the personnel away from patient care duties could cause patient harm.

C. If a law enforcement officer makes a request of emergency department personnel pursuant to subsection A of this section, the personnel shall comply with the request.  Emergency department personnel are not required to determine whether a law enforcement officer has a reasonable belief that a person may have violated section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383 when complying with the request in subsection A of this section.

D. Emergency department personnel do not incur any civil liability as a result of complying with this section unless the personnel, while performing the activity, act with gross negligence.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, if a civil penalty is paid on entry of judgment, the court may reduce the civil penalty by up to five percent of the penalty imposed.

C. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the court shall not initiate collection procedures on an unpaid civil penalty or notify the department to refuse to renew a vehicle registration for an unpaid civil traffic violation if all of the following apply:

1. The unpaid civil penalty is for a traffic violation for which the final disposition occurs more than thirty-six months before the court initiates collection proceedings.

2. The court does not have a paper or electronic record dated within thirty-six months after the traffic violation occurs indicating that the responsible person was notified that the civil penalty is unpaid and due.

#### Section 28-1602. Photo enforcement violations; law enforcement review; violation; classification; service of process; no duty to identify photo or respond; definitions

A. Notwithstanding any other law, if a person receives a notice of violation in the mail for a violation of chapter 3, article 3 or 6 of this title or of a city or town ordinance for excessive speed or failure to obey a traffic control device that is obtained using a photo enforcement system, the person does not have to do either of the following:

1. Identify who is in the photo.

2. Respond to the notice of violation.

B. The notice of violation must state the following:

1. The notice is not a court issued document and the recipient is under no obligation to identify the person or respond to the notice.

2. Failure to respond to the notice may result in official service that may result in an additional fee being levied.

D. A photo enforcement company may not determine whether a violation of chapter 3, article 3 or 6 of this title occurred for the purpose of the issuance of a citation.  A violation of this subsection is a class 1 misdemeanor.

E. In addition to any other means authorized by the Arizona rules of civil procedure, alternative service of process must be sent by certified mail with an additional copy by regular mail and a notice must be posted on the front door of the business or residence and, if present and accessible, a residence's garage door.  Service of the complaint is complete on filing the mailing receipt and proof of posting in the court having jurisdiction of the violation.  Notwithstanding any other law, a person's driving privileges may not be suspended or revoked as a result of a citation that is served by alternative service of process under this subsection.

G. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Notice of violation" means a notice issued by a photo enforcement company or municipality that is not a uniform traffic ticket and complaint.

2. "Photo enforcement system" has the same meaning prescribed in section 28-601.

B. In determining whether to mitigate a civil penalty, the court may consider any relevant information, including any of the following:

1. The civil penalty's impact on the person's ability to pay restitution.

2. Whether the civil penalty would constitute a financial hardship to the person or the person's immediate family.

3. Whether the person receives temporary assistance for needy families pursuant to 42 United States Code section 603 or supplemental nutrition assistance pursuant to 7 United States Code sections 2011 through 2036c.

4. Whether the person receives benefits pursuant to the supplemental security income program (42 United States Code sections 1381 through 1383f).

5. Whether the person is legally authorized to be employed and is seeking, obtaining or maintaining employment or is attending school.

#### Section 28-1872. Adoption of compact

The nonresident violator compact is adopted and enacted into law as follows:

Nonresident Violator Compact

Article I

Findings, Declaration of Policy and Purpose

(a) The party jurisdictions find that:

(1) In most instances, a motorist who is cited for a traffic violation in a jurisdiction other than his home jurisdiction either:

(i) Must post collateral or bond to secure appearance for trial at a later date.

(ii) If unable to post collateral or bond, is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted.

(iii) Is taken directly to court for the trial to be held.

(2) In some instances, the motorist's driver's license may be deposited as collateral to be returned after he has complied with the terms of the citation.

(3) The purpose of the practices described in paragraphs (1) and (2) above is to ensure compliance with the terms of a traffic citation by the motorist who, if permitted to continue on his way after receiving the traffic citation, could return to his home jurisdiction and disregard his duty under the terms of the traffic citation.

(4) A motorist receiving a traffic citation in his home jurisdiction is permitted, except for certain violations, to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and to immediately continue on his way after promising or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation.

(5) The practice described in paragraph (1) above causes unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the motorist who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial or pay the fine, and thus is compelled to remain in custody until some arrangement can be made.

(6) The deposit of a driver's license as a bail bond, as directed in paragraph (2) above, is viewed with disfavor.

(7) The practices described herein consume an undue amount of law enforcement time.

(b) It is the policy of the party jurisdictions to:

(1) Seek compliance with the laws, ordinances and administrative rules and regulations relating to the operation of motor vehicles in each of the jurisdictions.

E. Any administrator, executor, trustee or other representative of the owner, a peace officer or a person repossessing a vehicle under the terms of any conditional sales contract, lease, chattel mortgage or other security agreement or a purchaser at a sale foreclosing a lien, or the assignee or legal representative of any such person, may operate a vehicle from the place of repossession or place where it was formerly kept to a garage or place of storage in the county or state where the contract was recorded or where the person repossessing the vehicle resides or to any other garage or place of storage that is not more than seventy-five miles from the place of repossession or place where the vehicle was formerly kept by the owner if either of the following conditions exists:

5. Is subject to the following provisions that are not required to be in the policy:

(a) The liability of the insurance carrier with respect to the insurance required by this chapter becomes absolute when injury or damage covered by the motor vehicle liability policy occurs.

(b) The satisfaction by the insured of a judgment for the injury or damage is not a condition precedent to the right or duty of the insurance carrier to make payment on account of the injury or damage.

(c) The insurance carrier may settle any claim covered by the policy, and if the settlement is made in good faith, the amount of the claim is deductible from the limits of liability specified in subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section.

#### Section 28-4010. Motor vehicle liability policy; primary and excess coverage

A. If two or more policies affording valid and collectible motor vehicle liability insurance apply to the same motor vehicle that is involved in an occurrence out of which a liability loss arises and one of the policies affords coverage to a named insured engaged in the business of selling, repairing, servicing, delivering, testing, road testing, parking or storing motor vehicles, both of the following are conclusively presumed:

1. If at the time of loss the motor vehicle is being operated by a person engaged in one of the businesses or by the person's employee or agent, the insurance afforded by the policy issued to the person engaged in the business is primary and the insurance afforded by any other policy is excess.

2. If at the time of loss the motor vehicle is being operated by a person other than a person described in this subsection, the insurance afforded by the policy issued to a person engaged in a business described in this subsection is excess over all other insurance available to the operator as a named insured or otherwise.

B. Except as provided in subsection A, if two or more policies affording valid and collectible liability insurance apply to the same motor vehicle that is involved in an occurrence out of which a liability loss arises, it is conclusively presumed that the insurance afforded by that policy in which the motor vehicle is described or rated as an owned automobile is primary and the insurance afforded by any other policy or policies is excess.

C. The presumptions stated in subsection A may be modified or amended only by a written agreement signed by all insurers who have issued a policy or policies applicable to a loss described in subsection A and all named insureds under these policies.

#### Section 28-4011. Bonds; motor carriers; amount; failure of security

A. A self-insurer or partial self-insurer shall file a bond with the director on a form approved by the director with a surety company authorized by the corporation commission to transact business in this state as surety on the bond.  The self-insurer or partial self-insurer shall be the principal obligor and this state shall be the obligee on the bond.  The bond shall be conditioned on the compliance by the self-insurer or partial self-insurer with laws governing motor carriers.

B. The director shall fix the total amount of the bond required of a self-insurer or partial self-insurer and may increase or reduce the amount at any time, subject to the limitations provided in this section.  The bond required of a self-insurer or partial self-insurer shall be at least two hundred fifty thousand dollars.

C. A self-insurer or partial self-insurer may request in writing that the director reduce a bond required pursuant to this section.  The director may reduce a bond if the director determines that the self-insurer or partial self-insurer has continuously complied with this article and the self-insurer or partial self-insurer has not incurred claims for accidents involving motor vehicles for at least the previous three consecutive years. If the director determines that the reduction of the bond would jeopardize public safety, the director may elect to retain the bond or may increase the bond amount required.  A person who is aggrieved by a decision of the director pursuant to this subsection may appeal the decision by requesting a hearing.

D. If liability on the bond filed by the self-insurer or partial self-insurer with the director is discharged or reduced or if in the opinion of the director a surety on the bond given has become unsatisfactory or unacceptable, the director may require the self-insurer or partial self-insurer to file a new bond with satisfactory sureties in the same amount.  If the self-insurer or partial self-insurer fails to file a new bond as required, the director shall cancel the person's certificate of self-insurance or partial self-insurance immediately.  If a new bond is furnished by the self-insurer or partial self-insurer, the director shall cancel and surrender the bond for which the new bond is substituted.

E. If the director decides that the amount of the existing bond is insufficient to ensure the safety of the public and the director gives the self-insurer or partial self-insurer five days written notice mailed to the self-insurer's or partial self-insurer’s last known address, on the written demand of the director, the self-insurer or partial self-insurer shall immediately file an additional bond in the same manner and form with a surety company on the bond approved by the director in an amount determined by the director as necessary to protect public safety at all times. If the self-insurer or partial self-insurer fails to file an additional bond as required, the director shall immediately cancel the certificate of self-insurance or partial self-insurance of the person.

F. A surety on a bond furnished by a self-insurer or partial self-insurer shall be released and discharged from all liability to this state accruing on the bond on the last day of the month that includes the sixtieth day after the date on which the surety files with the director a written request to be released and discharged.  The request does not relieve, release or discharge the surety from liability already accrued or from liability that accrues before the last day of the month that includes the end of the sixty day period.  On receipt of notice of the request, the director shall promptly notify the self-insurer or partial self-insurer who furnished the bond and shall immediately cancel the certificate of self-insurance or partial self-insurance of the person, unless the self-insurer or partial self-insurer, on or before the last day of the month that includes the end of the sixty day period, files with the director a new bond with a surety company satisfactory to the director in the amount and form provided in this section.  If a new bond is furnished by the self-insurer or partial self-insurer, the director shall cancel and surrender the bond for which the new bond is substituted.

### Article 5 - Franchise Regulation

#### Section 28-4451. Product liability; warranty obligations; audits; vehicle exports; used vehicle recall obligations; definition

A. Each manufacturer shall file with the director a copy of the delivery and preparation obligations required to be performed by a new motor vehicle dealer before delivery of new motor vehicles to buyers. These delivery and preparation obligations constitute the new motor vehicle dealer's only responsibility for the product liability as between the new motor vehicle dealers and the manufacturer.  The new motor vehicle dealer shall furnish the buyer of a new motor vehicle with a signed copy of the manufacturer's or distributor's delivery and preparation requirements indicating that all of the requirements have in fact been performed.

B. Any mechanical, body or parts defects arising from any express or implied warranties of the manufacturer constitute the manufacturer's product or warranty liability.

C. The manufacturer or distributor shall compensate an authorized new motor vehicle dealer who performs work to rectify the manufacturer's or distributor's warranty obligations, recall obligations or delivery and preparation obligations.

D. The compensation that the manufacturer or distributor pays to a new motor vehicle dealer for diagnostic work, repair service and labor shall be fair and reasonable and, at the option of the new motor vehicle dealer, may be determined pursuant to subsection E of this section.  Time allowances for the diagnosis and performance of warranty work and service shall be reasonable and adequate for the work or services to be performed.  The compensation that the manufacturer or distributor pays to the new motor vehicle dealer for parts used in warranty or recall related service shall be fair and reasonable and, at the option of the new motor vehicle dealer, may be determined pursuant to subsection E of this section.

E. The new motor vehicle dealer may declare the retail rates that it customarily charges for parts or labor or both parts and labor by submitting to the manufacturer or distributor the lesser of one hundred sequential, nonwarranty, customer-paid service repair orders or ninety consecutive days of customer-paid service repair orders for warranty-like repairs made not more than one hundred eighty days before the submission.  The new motor vehicle dealer's retail labor rate shall be determined by dividing the amount of the dealer's total labor sales contained in the submitted repair orders by the total number of labor hours that generated those sales. The new motor vehicle dealer's retail rate for parts shall be a percentage determined by dividing the total sales for parts in the submitted repair orders by the new motor vehicle dealer's total cost for those parts, minus one, multiplied by one hundred to produce a percentage.  Declared rates are presumed to be fair and reasonable except that a manufacturer or distributor, within thirty days after receiving the new motor vehicle dealer's submission, may rebut the presumption by reasonably substantiating that the rate or rates are inaccurate or unreasonable compared to other similarly situated same line-make new motor vehicle dealers in this state. The new motor vehicle dealer's declared parts, labor or both parts and labor rates shall go into effect thirty days following the manufacturer's or distributor's receipt of the declaration, unless the manufacturer or distributor timely sends a rebuttal of the declared rate or rates to the new motor vehicle dealer.  If any of the declared rates are rebutted, the manufacturer or distributor shall propose an adjustment of the rebutted rate or rates within thirty days after receiving the new motor vehicle dealer's submission. If the new motor vehicle dealer does not agree with the proposed adjusted rate or rates, it may file a protest with the director within thirty days after receipt of the manufacturer's or distributor's proposal.  If a protest is timely filed, the director shall inform the manufacturer or distributor that a timely protest has been filed and that a hearing will be held on the protest if any available manufacturer or distributor mediation opportunity has been used and was unsuccessful in reaching an agreement between the parties.

F. In calculating the retail rate or rates that a new motor vehicle dealer customarily charges for parts or labor, the following work may not be included in the calculation:

1. Repairs for manufacturer or distributor special events, specials or promotional discounts for retail customer repairs.

2. Parts sold at wholesale.

3. Engine assemblies and transmission assemblies, if the new motor vehicle dealer agrees to be compensated for those assemblies with a handling charge instead of a retail parts markup.

4. Routine maintenance not covered under any retail customer warranty, such as fluids, filters and belts not provided in the course of repairs.

5. Nuts, bolts, fasteners and similar items that do not have individual part numbers.

6. Vehicle reconditioning.

G. The manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch may reasonably and periodically audit a new motor vehicle dealer to determine the validity of paid claims for dealer compensation or any charge-backs for warranty parts or service compensation. Audits shall only be for the twelve month period immediately following the date of the payment. This limitation does not apply if the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch reasonably suspects fraud.  As a result of an audit that is authorized by this subsection, the manufacturer or distributor has the right to charge back to the new motor vehicle dealer the amount of any previously paid claim after the new motor vehicle dealer has had notice and an opportunity to participate in any available manufacturer or distributor mediation processes and all legal appeals have been exhausted if mediation failed to result in an agreement.

H. The manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch shall reserve the right to reasonable periodic audits to determine the validity of paid claims for dealer compensation or any charge-backs for consumer or dealer incentives. Audits shall only be for a one year period immediately following the date of the payment. This limitation does not apply if the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch reasonably suspects fraud. As a result of an audit authorized by this subsection, the manufacturer or distributor has the right to charge back to the new motor vehicle dealer the amount of any previously paid claim after the new motor vehicle dealer has had notice and an opportunity to participate in any available manufacturer or distributor mediation processes and all legal appeals have been exhausted if mediation failed to result in an agreement.

I. All claims by new motor vehicle dealers under this section for labor and parts and all claims for compensation relative to any sales incentive programs shall be paid within thirty days after approval by the manufacturer or distributor subject to the manufacturer's or distributor's right to audit the claims provided in subsection G or H of this section.  All claims shall be either approved or disapproved within thirty days after receipt on forms and in the manner specified by the manufacturer or distributor. Any claim not disapproved in writing or by means of electronic transmission within thirty days after receipt is deemed approved, and payment must be made within thirty days after approval.

J. If a manufacturer or distributor furnishes a part or component to a new motor vehicle dealer, at no cost, to use in performing repairs under a recall, campaign service action or warranty repair, the manufacturer or distributor shall compensate the dealer for the part or component in the same manner as warranty parts compensation under this section by compensating the dealer the retail parts rate on the wholesale cost for the part or component as listed in the manufacturer's or distributor's price schedule, minus the wholesale cost for the part or component.

K. A manufacturer or distributor may not require a new motor vehicle dealer to establish the retail rates customarily charged by the dealer for parts or labor by an unduly burdensome or time-consuming method or by requiring information that is unduly burdensome or time-consuming to provide calculations, including part-by-part or transaction-by-transaction calculations.  A new motor vehicle dealer may not declare any new retail rate more than once in any twelve-month period. A manufacturer or distributor may use the repair orders submitted by a new motor vehicle dealer under subsection E of this section to validate any or all of a new motor vehicle dealer's current warranty reimbursement rates or require a new motor vehicle dealer to submit, not more than once every twelve months, repair orders pursuant to this section to validate the new motor vehicle dealer's retail rate or rates.  If a manufacturer or distributor finds that any of a new motor vehicle dealer's retail rates have declined, the manufacturer or distributor may prospectively reduce the respective warranty reimbursement rate.

L. If the new motor vehicle dealer has otherwise properly submitted the claim pursuant to the manufacturer's or distributor's warranty or incentive program guidelines, a manufacturer or distributor may not deny a claim by a new motor vehicle dealer for reimbursement of any warranty parts or service compensation or any consumer or dealer incentive compensation based solely on a new motor vehicle dealer's incidental failure to comply with a specific claim processing requirement that does not put into question the legitimacy of the claim.  If a claim is rejected for such an incidental requirement the new motor vehicle dealer may correct or complete and resubmit a previously submitted warranty or incentive claim for a period of up to sixty days following the new motor vehicle dealer's receipt of first notice of the failure from the manufacturer or distributor. A manufacturer or distributor is not required to approve any such warranty or incentive claim if all claim processing requirements are not complied with by the new motor vehicle dealer within the time periods prescribed by this section.

M. If a new motor vehicle dealer sells or leases a vehicle to a customer who exports the vehicle to a foreign country, unless the manufacturer, distributor or importer proves that the new motor vehicle dealer knew or reasonably should have known that the vehicle would be exported, a manufacturer, distributor or importer shall not do any of the following:

1. Refuse to sell, allocate or deliver new motor vehicles to the new motor vehicle dealer.

2. Charge back to or withhold payments or other things of value from the new motor vehicle dealer that the new motor vehicle dealer otherwise would be eligible for under an incentive program or contest.

3. Prevent a new motor vehicle dealer from participating in any sales promotion or program.

4. Take an adverse action against a new motor vehicle dealer, including reducing vehicle allocations or terminating or threatening to terminate a dealer.

N. There is a rebuttable presumption that the new motor vehicle dealer described in subsection M of this section did not know or should not have reasonably known that the vehicle described in subsection M of this section would be exported. The presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence that the new motor vehicle dealer knew or should have reasonably known that the vehicle was to be exported.

O. If a timely protest is filed under subsection E of this section, the director shall:

1. Enter an order fixing the time and place of a hearing on the protest. The hearing shall be held within seventy-five days after the date of the order.

2. Send by certified mail a copy of the order to the dealer and the manufacturer.

3. Appoint a member of the Arizona state bar who shall be designated as an administrative law judge to conduct the hearing and who shall be compensated under a contractual relationship.

P. Prehearing discovery shall be conducted pursuant to the Arizona rules of civil procedure.

Q. Evidence that would be admissible under the issues in such an action in a state or federal court is admissible in a hearing held by the administrative law judge.  The administrative law judge shall reasonably apportion all costs between the parties, including compensation for the administrative law judge's services.  The administrative law judge may:

1. Issue subpoenas.

2. Administer oaths.

3. Compel the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers, documents and all other evidence.

4. Apply to the superior court in the county in which the hearing is held for a court order enforcing this section.

R. A transcript of the testimony of all witnesses taken at the hearing shall be made and preserved.  Within forty-five days after the hearing the administrative law judge shall make written findings of fact and conclusions of law and enter a final order.

S. A party to the hearing before the administrative law judge may appeal pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.  An appeal of a decision of an administrative law judge has preference over other civil matters and shall be heard at the earliest practicable date.

T. As a condition to the appeal, the appealing party shall file a cash bond, supersedeas bond or its equivalent with the director.  The bond shall be sufficient in amount to cover the damages incurred by the prevailing party, but the amount of the bond may not exceed the lesser of fifty thousand dollars or ten percent of the appealing party's net worth. The appealing party may file alternatives to cash such as certificates of deposit purchased from a financial institution licensed to do business in this state pursuant to title 6 or bonds of the United States government.

U. A manufacturer shall compensate its new motor vehicle dealers for all labor and parts that are required to perform recall repairs. The compensation shall be fair and reasonable and, at the option of the new motor vehicle dealer, may be determined pursuant to subsection E of this section. If parts or a remedy is not reasonably available to perform a recall service or repair on a used motor vehicle held for sale by the new motor vehicle dealer that is authorized to sell new motor vehicles of the same line-make of the recalled motor vehicle within thirty days after the manufacturer issues a stop-sale or do not drive notification on the used motor vehicle, the manufacturer shall compensate the new motor vehicle dealer at a rate of at least 1.5 percent of the value of the used motor vehicle per month, or prorated portion of a month when applicable, until a date when the recall parts or remedy are delivered to the dealer or when the vehicle is no longer in the new motor vehicle dealer's inventory.

V. The value of the used motor vehicle that is subject to a stop-sale or do not drive notification shall be the average trade-in value for used vehicles as determined by reference to a nationally recognized publication that reports on used motor vehicle values.

W. It is a violation of this section for a manufacturer to reduce the amount of compensation that is otherwise owed to a new motor vehicle dealer, whether through a chargeback, removal from an incentive program, reduction in amount owed under an incentive program or any other means, because the new motor vehicle dealer has submitted a claim for compensation under subsection U of this section or was otherwise compensated for a vehicle that is subject to a recall if a stop-sale or do not drive notification has been issued.

X. All reimbursement claims that are made by a new motor vehicle dealer pursuant to subsection U of this section for recall remedies or repairs or for compensation if no part or repair is reasonably available and the used motor vehicle is subject to a stop-sale or do not drive notification shall be made in compliance with at least one of the following:

1. In a like manner as a warranty reimbursement claim under this section.

2. At a rate set forth in a national compensation program that the manufacturer manages if the compensation provided to the new motor vehicle dealer equals or exceeds the reimbursement level for a claim that is determined as a warranty reimbursement claim pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection.

3. At the level set forth in the national compensation program without further consideration if the manufacturer and new motor vehicle dealer agree.

Y. The manufacturer shall approve or disapprove a claim within thirty days after it is submitted to the manufacturer in the manner and on the forms the manufacturer reasonably prescribes. The manufacturer shall pay a claim within thirty days after approval of the claim. Any claim that is not specifically disapproved in writing by the manufacturer within thirty days following the manufacturer's receipt of the claim is deemed approved.

Z. Subsections U through Y of this section apply only to used motor vehicles that are subject to safety or emissions recalls pursuant to and recalled in accordance with federal law and for which a stop-sale or do not drive notification has been issued and to motor vehicle manufacturers and new motor vehicle dealers with used motor vehicles of the line-make that the new motor vehicle dealer is franchised to sell or on which the new motor vehicle dealer is authorized to perform recall repairs.

AA. Subsections U through Y of this section apply only to new motor vehicle dealers holding an affected used motor vehicle for sale that was any of the following:

1. In inventory at the time the stop-sale or do not drive notification was issued.

2. Taken in the used motor vehicle inventory of the new motor vehicle dealer as a consumer trade-in incident to the purchase of a new motor vehicle from the new motor vehicle dealer after the stop-sale or do not drive notification was issued.

3. Properly taken in the used motor vehicle inventory of the new motor vehicle dealer as a lease return vehicle returned to the new motor vehicle dealer in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract.

BB. For the purposes of this section, "stop-sale or do not drive notification" means a notification that is issued by a manufacturer to some or all of its franchised dealerships and that states that certain used motor vehicles in the dealerships' inventories shall not be sold or leased, either at retail or wholesale, due to a federal safety defect or noncompliance recall or a federal or California emissions recall.

 

#### Section 28-4452. Limitations; franchise establishment, cancellation, termination or nonrenewal

A. Notwithstanding the terms, provisions or conditions of an agreement or franchise, a franchisor shall not cancel, terminate or refuse to renew a franchise unless the franchisor has good cause for termination or nonrenewal.

B. A franchisor shall not enter into a franchise for the purpose of establishing an additional new motor vehicle dealership in a community in which the same line-make is then represented, unless there is good cause for the additional new motor vehicle dealership under the franchise and unless it is in the public interest.

If a franchisor seeks to enter into a franchise establishing an additional new motor vehicle dealership of the same line-make, the franchisor shall, and the franchisee may at any time, file with the director a notice of intention to enter into a franchise for additional representation of the same line-make.

B. If the franchisor intends to establish an additional new motor vehicle dealership, the director shall send notice within five days of receipt to all franchisees of the same line-make in the community and to all other franchises located within ten miles of the proposed dealership by the shortest street route, if located outside the community, who are then engaged in the business of offering to sell or selling the same line-make. In counties with a population of less than two hundred thousand persons, the notice additionally shall be sent to all dealers located within twenty miles of the proposed new franchise as determined by the shortest street route. The director shall address copies of notices to the principal place of business of the franchisees.

C. The relocation or the reopening of a dealership within two years of the closing within the area of responsibility assigned in the franchise is not considered an additional dealership for purposes of this chapter, provided that the location of the replacement dealership is within one mile of the previous location.

1. The objector is a new motor vehicle dealer located in the same community as the proposed new motor vehicle dealership, or within ten miles by the shortest street route of the proposed dealership, if located outside the community. If the proposed franchise is located in a county with a population of less than two hundred thousand persons, a dealer of the same line-make located within twenty miles, as determined by the shortest street route, also has standing to object pursuant to this section.

2. The objector is providing facilities, equipment, parts, capital and personnel in substantial compliance with its contractual obligation to the franchisor.

#### Section 28-4455. Determination of standing; failure to object

A. If the director intends to determine that the objector has established both of the reasons prescribed by section 28-4454, subsection B, the director shall notify the franchisor and allow the franchisor to submit evidence in rebuttal before the director makes a final determination.

If there is an objection to the establishment of a new motor vehicle dealership, the administrative law judge shall determine that good cause does or does not exist to establish the proposed dealership.

D. Evidence that would be admissible under the issues in such an action in a state or federal court is admissible in a hearing held by the administrative law judge.

The party may file alternatives to cash such as certificates of deposit purchased from a financial institution licensed to do business in this state or bonds of the United States government.

#### Section 28-4457. Franchise termination, cancellation or nonrenewal; good cause; changes

A. Notwithstanding the terms, provisions or conditions of an agreement or franchise, the following are not good cause for the termination, cancellation or nonrenewal of a franchise:

1. The change of ownership of the franchisee's dealership. This paragraph does not authorize a change in ownership that would have the effect of the sale of the franchise without the manufacturer's or distributor's consent.  The consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The burden of establishing the reasonableness is on the franchisor.

2. The fact that the franchisee refused to purchase or accept delivery of a new motor vehicle, parts or accessories or any other commodity or service not ordered by the franchisee.

B. If a franchisor enters into or attempts to enter into a franchise, whether on termination or cancellation, on refusal to renew another franchise or on the establishment of an additional new motor vehicle dealership in a community where the same line-make is then represented, without first complying with this chapter, a license under this chapter shall not be issued to that franchisee or proposed franchisee to engage in the business of selling new motor vehicles that are manufactured or distributed by that franchisor.

C. In determining whether good cause has been established for terminating, canceling or not renewing a franchise, the administrative law judge shall consider the existing circumstances, including the following:

1. Amount of business transacted by the franchisee.

2. Investment necessarily made and obligations incurred by the franchisee in the performance of the franchisee's part of the franchise.

3. Permanency of the investment.

4. Whether it is injurious to the public welfare for the business of the franchisee to be discontinued.

5. Whether the franchisee has adequate new motor vehicle facilities, equipment, parts and qualified management, sales and service personnel to reasonably provide consumer care for the new motor vehicles sold at retail by the franchisee and any other new motor vehicle of the same line-make.

6. Whether the franchisee refuses to honor warranties of the franchisor to be performed by the franchisee if the franchisor reimburses the franchisee for the warranty work performed by the franchisee.

7. Except as provided in subsection A:

(a) Failure by the franchisee to substantially comply with those requirements of the franchise that are determined by the administrative law judge to be reasonable and material.

(b) Bad faith by the franchisee in complying with those terms of the franchise that are determined by the administrative law judge to be reasonable and material.

D. If failure by the franchisee to substantially comply with a reasonable and material provision of the franchise relates to the performance of sales or service by the franchisee, good cause is established if all of the following are true:

1. The franchisor notifies the franchisee of the failure in writing.

2. The notice states that it is provided for failure of performance pursuant to this chapter.

3. The franchisee is provided a reasonable opportunity in which to exert good faith efforts to carry out the provisions of the franchise. The reasonable opportunity provided shall be over a period of at least one hundred eighty days.

4. The franchisee does not demonstrate substantial compliance with the franchisor's performance standards during that period and the failure to demonstrate compliance is not due to factors controlled by the franchisor.

E. In determining whether good cause has been established for entering into an additional franchise for the same line-make the administrative law judge shall consider the existing circumstances including the following:

1. Amount of business transacted by other franchisees of the same line-make in that community.

2. Investment necessarily made and obligations incurred by other franchisees of the same line-make in that community in the performance of their part of their franchises.

3. Whether the franchisees of the same line-make in that community are providing adequate consumer care for the new motor vehicle products of the line-make, including the adequacy of new motor vehicle dealer sales and service facilities, equipment, supply of parts and qualified management, sales and service personnel.

4. The economic impact on existing franchisees of the same line-make due to the addition of a franchise.

5. The effect on the retail motor vehicle business and the consuming public.

F. On the termination or nonrenewal of a franchise for any reason, including the cessation of a line-make but not including a voluntary termination of the franchise agreement by the franchisee or a termination by the franchisor based on good cause as determined pursuant to this section, the franchisor must do all of the following:

1. Pay the franchisee being terminated the fair market value of the franchise as of the date of the notice of termination or nonrenewal or twelve months before the date of notice, whichever is greater.  The fair market value shall be the goodwill value of the franchisee's franchise in the franchisee's community as of the relevant date.

2. Reimburse the franchisee for the cost of any facility upgrades and renovations required by the franchisor within three years before the termination or nonrenewal less any offsets actually received by the franchisee from the franchisor toward the upgrades or renovations, including stipends, credits and other subsidies.

3. Repurchase any data processing programs, software and equipment required by the franchisor for communication of sales, service, warranty or other information to the franchisor or report data to the franchisor that meets the following criteria:

(a) Was used by the franchisee exclusively for the line-make vehicle covered by the dealer agreement being terminated or not renewed.

(b) Was purchased by the franchisee in the three year period before the termination or nonrenewal of the dealer agreement or was leased by the franchisee before the effective date of the termination or nonrenewal, except that the franchisor shall only be responsible for payments under the lease for a period not to exceed three years.

4. Pay to the franchisee an amount equal to twelve months' rent at the fair market rental value for the real property, except that if the real property is leased from a third party who is unrelated to the franchisee, the amount to be paid by the franchisor shall equal twelve months' rent pursuant to the current lease of the real property in effect at the time of the termination or nonrenewal.  If the termination or nonrenewal relates to fewer than all of the franchises operated by the franchisee at a single location, the amount to be paid by the franchisor pursuant to this paragraph shall be based on the percentage of the total square footage attributed to the franchise being terminated or not renewed at the time of the termination or nonrenewal.

5. Compensate the franchisee for all new, unused and undamaged parts listed in the manufacturer's current parts catalog and still in the original merchandising packaging.  The prices for the parts are the prices in effect as of the effective date of the termination or nonrenewal of the franchise, less any applicable allowances, credits or subsidies actually received by the franchisee from the franchisor.

6. Compensate the franchisee for the fair market value of all undamaged, except for ordinary wear and tear, and unmodified special tools, equipment and signage that are required by the franchisor and that are acquired by the franchisee within the three year period before the termination or nonrenewal.

7. Compensate the franchisee at the dealer's net acquisition cost for all new, undamaged, unmodified and unsold vehicle inventory of the current model year and one model year before that is acquired from the manufacturer or from another same line-make dealer in the ordinary course of business before the effective date of the termination or nonrenewal if the vehicle has less than five hundred miles registered on the odometer.

G. Payments made pursuant to subsection F are in addition to any other payments required by the laws of this state or the applicable franchise agreement.  Payments shall be made to the franchisee no later than ninety days after the effective date of the termination or nonrenewal of the dealer agreement and a showing that the franchisee can deliver good and clear title to the items described in subsection F.

 

#### Section 28-4458. Coercion prohibited

A. A manufacturer of new motor vehicles, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, field representative, officer or agent or any representative of a manufacturer of new motor vehicles, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, field representative, officer or agent shall not coerce or attempt to coerce a new motor vehicle dealer to do any of the following:

3. Do any other act unfair to the dealer by threatening to cancel or not renew a franchise existing between the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or representative of the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch and the dealer.

4. Construct, renovate or make substantial alterations to the dealer's facilities unless the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or representative of the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor or distributor branch is able to demonstrate that the changes are reasonable and justifiable in light of current and reasonably foreseeable economic conditions, the availability of additional vehicle allocation and the dealer's market for the sale of vehicles or unless the alteration is reasonably required to effectively display and service a vehicle based on the technology of the vehicle.

5. Enter into a real property use or site control agreement as a condition of awarding a franchise, adding a line-make or dealer agreement to an existing new motor vehicle dealer, renewing a dealer agreement, approving the sale or transfer of the ownership of a dealership or approving the relocation of a dealership.  This paragraph does not apply to a real property use or site control agreement if either of the following is offered to and accepted by the dealer without coercion or condition in exchange for a real property use or site control agreement:

(a) Fair and reasonable monetary consideration.

6. In connection with the sale of a used motor vehicle, other than a used motor vehicle sold pursuant to a factory's certified pre-owned program, require the use of only parts and accessories manufactured by the manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or importer.  This paragraph does not apply to parts used to perform repairs pursuant to a recall or repairs performed pursuant to a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or importer's warranty.

B. A manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or field representative or an officer, agent or representative of a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or field representative shall not require, coerce or attempt to coerce any new motor vehicle dealer in this state to refrain from participation in the management of, investment in or acquisition of any other line-make of new motor vehicle or related products unless justified by reasonable business considerations.

C. A manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch, field representative or officer shall not coerce or attempt to coerce a motor vehicle dealer and a manufacturer shall not do either of the following:

1. Release to any outside party any confidential financial information of the dealer that may be provided from time to time by the dealer.

2. Release to the general public average or composite prices, identified as such, based in whole or in part on such financial information.

D. Information described in subsection C, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section shall not be released without the express written consent of the dealer, except that it may be released:

1. Pursuant to subpoena or as otherwise required by law in any administrative, judicial or arbitration proceeding or in any law enforcement investigation.

E. A manufacturer, importer or distributor shall not adopt, change, establish or implement a plan or system for the allocation, scheduling or delivery of new motor vehicles, parts or accessories to its motor vehicle dealers that is not fair, reasonable and equitable or modify an existing plan or system for the allocation, scheduling or delivery of new motor vehicles, parts or accessories in a manner that causes the plan or system to be unreasonable, unfair or inequitable. On the request of a franchisee, a manufacturer, importer or distributor shall disclose in writing to the franchisee the basis on which new motor vehicles, parts and accessories are allocated, scheduled and delivered among the manufacturer's, importer's or distributor's dealers of the same line-make.

F. A manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or field representative or an officer, agent or representative of a manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or field representative shall not require a dealer or condition the awarding of a franchise, the addition of a line-make, the renewal of a franchise, the approval of the relocation of a franchise or the approval of a sale or transfer of a franchise on the willingness of a dealer or a proposed dealer or owner of an interest in the dealership facility to construct, renovate or maintain exclusive facilities, personnel or showroom area dedicated to a particular line-make if the imposition of such a requirement would be unreasonable in light of the existing circumstances, including the manufacturer's reasonable business considerations, present economic and market conditions and forecasts for future economic and market conditions in the dealer's retail territory. The manufacturer, factory branch, distributor, distributor branch or field representative has the burden of proof to demonstrate that its demand for exclusivity is justified by reasonable business considerations and is reasonable in light of the dealer's circumstances. This subsection does not apply to a voluntary agreement between a dealer and a manufacturer if separate and valuable consideration was offered and accepted.  The renewal of a franchise agreement does not, by itself, constitute separate and valuable consideration.  The manufacturer has the burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the dealer entered into a voluntary agreement regarding exclusivity.

G. Any condition, stipulation or provision in a franchise or distributorship agreement purporting to bind any person acquiring or holding a franchise or distributorship to waive compliance with any provision of this chapter or any other law of this state is void except that a person who is acquiring or holding a franchise or distributorship is not prohibited under this section from electing in writing, at or after the time a dispute arises, from using any voluntary dispute resolution procedure, from entering into any voluntary agreement to settle legitimate disputes between the disputed parties or from entering into any agreement waiving any provision of this chapter or any other law of this state for which the franchisee receives separate and valid consideration at the time of the execution of the waiver.

The manufacturer or distributor notifies the dealer in writing within sixty days after receipt of the completed application forms and related information generally used by a manufacturer or distributor to conduct its review and a copy of all agreements regarding the proposed transfer of its intent to exercise its right of first refusal or its rejection of the proposed transfer. If the manufacturer or distributor fails to notify the dealer of its exercise of its right of first refusal or its rejection of the proposed transfer within the sixty day period, the proposed transfer is deemed to be approved by the manufacturer or distributor.

The exercise of the right of first refusal results in the dealer receiving the same or greater compensation than the dealer negotiated or contracted to receive in connection with the proposed change of all, or substantially all, ownership of the dealership or transfer of all, or substantially all, dealership assets.

3. The proposed change of all, or substantially all, dealership assets does not involve the transfer of assets or the transfer or issuance of stock by the dealer or one or more dealer owners to a designated family member or members or the spouse, child, grandchild, spouse of a child or grandchild, brother, sister or parent of the dealer or one or more dealer owners or to a qualified manager, a partnership or a corporation controlled by any of those persons.

4. The manufacturer or distributor agrees to pay the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney fees that do not exceed the usual, customary and reasonable fees charged for similar work done for other clients, incurred by the proposed new owner and transferee before the manufacturer's or distributor's exercise of its right of first refusal in negotiating and implementing the contract for the proposed change of all, or substantially all, ownership of the dealership or transfer of all, or substantially all, dealership assets. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, a manufacturer or distributor shall not pay those expenses and attorney fees if the dealer has not submitted or caused to be submitted to the manufacturer or distributor an accounting of those expenses within twenty days after the dealers' receipt of the manufacturer's or distributor's written request for the accounting.

The motor vehicle fuel and use fuel taxes imposed pursuant to this section and the aviation fuel taxes imposed pursuant to section 28-8344 are conclusively presumed to be direct taxes on the consumer or user but shall be collected and remitted to the department by suppliers for the purpose of convenience and facility only.  Motor vehicle fuel, use fuel and aviation fuel taxes that are collected and paid to the department by a supplier are considered to be advance payments, shall be added to the price of motor vehicle fuel, use fuel or aviation fuel and shall be recovered from the consumer or user.

D. Motor vehicle fuel and use fuel taxes imposed pursuant to this section on the use of motor vehicle fuel and use fuel and the aviation fuel taxes imposed pursuant to section 28-8344 on the use of aviation fuel, other than by bulk transfer, arise at the time the motor vehicle, use or aviation fuel either:

1. Is imported into this state and is measured by invoiced gallons received outside this state at a refinery, terminal or bulk plant for delivery to a destination in this state.

2. Is removed, as measured by invoiced gallons, from the bulk transfer terminal system or from a qualified terminal in this state.

3. Is removed, as measured by invoiced gallons, from the bulk transfer terminal system or from a qualified terminal or refinery outside this state for delivery to a destination in this state as represented on the shipping papers if a supplier imports the motor vehicle, use or aviation fuel for the account of the supplier or the supplier has made a tax precollection election pursuant to section 28-5636.

E. If motor fuel is removed from the bulk transfer terminal system or from a qualified terminal or is imported into this state, the original removal, transfer or importation of the motor fuel is subject to the collection of the tax. If this motor fuel is transported to another qualified terminal or reenters the bulk transfer terminal system, the subsequent sale of the motor fuel on which tax has been collected is not subject to collection of an additional tax if proper documentation is retained to support the transaction.

A. A supplier shall file a bond with the director on a form approved by the director with a surety company authorized by the Arizona corporation commission to transact business in this state as surety on the bond.

If the supplier fails to file an additional bond as required, the director shall cancel the license of the supplier immediately.

F. A surety on a bond furnished by a supplier shall be released and discharged from all liability to this state accruing on the bond on the last day of the month that includes the sixtieth day after the date on which the surety files with the director a written request to be released and discharged.  The request does not relieve, release or discharge the surety from liability already accrued or from liability that accrues before the last day of the month that includes the end of the sixty day period. On receipt of notice of the request, the director shall promptly notify the supplier who furnished the bond and shall cancel the license of the supplier immediately, unless the supplier, on or before the last day of the month that includes the end of the sixty day period, files with the director a new bond with a surety company satisfactory to the director in the amount and form provided in this section.  If the new bond is furnished by the supplier, the director shall cancel and surrender the bond for which the new bond is substituted.

C. The director may cancel the license of a supplier on investigation and sixty days' notice mailed to the last known address of the supplier if the director determines that the person to whom the license has been issued is no longer engaged in the business of a supplier and has not been engaged in the business of a supplier for six months before the cancellation.

F. Each supplier who elects to precollect tax under this section agrees to waive any defense that the state lacks jurisdiction to require collection on all out-of-state sales by the supplier as to which the supplier had knowledge that the shipments were destined for this state and agrees that this state imposes the requirement pursuant to this subsection under its general police powers to regulate the movement of motor vehicle or aviation fuel.

G.

1. Progress payments may be made by the department to the contractor on the basis of a duly certified and approved estimate of the work performed during a preceding period of time.  The progress payments shall be paid on or before fourteen days after the estimate of the work is certified and approved. The estimate of the work shall be deemed received by the department on submission to the person designated by the department for the submission, review or approval of the estimate of the work. An estimate of the work submitted under this section shall be deemed approved and certified seven days after the date of submission unless before that time the department prepares and issues a specific written finding detailing those items in the estimate of the work that are not approved and certified under the contract.  The department may withhold an amount from the progress payment that is sufficient to pay the expenses the department reasonably expects to incur in correcting the deficiency set forth in the written finding. On completion and acceptance of separate divisions of the contract on which the price is stated separately in the contract, payment may be made in full including retained percentages, less deductions, unless a substitute security has been provided.

2. The contractor shall pay to the contractor's subcontractors or material suppliers and each subcontractor shall pay to the subcontractor's subcontractors or material suppliers, within seven days after receipt of each progress payment, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, the respective amounts allowed the contractor or subcontractor on account of the work performed by the contractor's or subcontractor's subcontractors or material suppliers, to the extent of each subcontractor's or material supplier's interest in the amount. These payments to subcontractors or material suppliers shall be based on payments received pursuant to this section. Any diversion by the contractor or subcontractor of payment received for work performed on a contract or failure to reasonably account for the application or use of the payments constitutes grounds for disciplinary action by the registrar of contractors. A subcontractor or material supplier shall notify the registrar of contractors and the department in writing of any payment less than the amount of percentage approved for the class or item of work as set forth in this section.

3. A subcontractor may notify the department in writing requesting that the subcontractor be notified by the department in writing within five days after payment of each progress payment that is made to the contractor.  The subcontractor's request under this paragraph remains in effect for the duration of the subcontractor's work on the project.

4. If any payment to a contractor is delayed after the date due, interest shall be paid at the rate of one percent per month or a fraction of the month on the unpaid balance.

5. If any periodic or final payment to a subcontractor or material supplier is delayed by more than seven days after receipt of the periodic or final payment by the contractor or subcontractor, the contractor or subcontractor shall pay the subcontractor or material supplier interest, beginning on the eighth day, at the rate of one percent per month or a fraction of a month on the unpaid balance.

B. A contract for construction shall not materially alter the rights of any contractor, subcontractor or material supplier to receive prompt and timely payment as provided under this section.

C. This section does not prevent a contractor or subcontractor, at the time of application and certification to the department or contractor, from withholding the application and certification to the department or contractor for payment to the subcontractor or material supplier for unsatisfactory job progress, defective construction work or materials not remedied, disputed work or materials, third-party claims filed or reasonable evidence that a claim will be filed, failure of a subcontractor to make timely payments for labor, equipment and materials, damage to the contractor or another subcontractor, reasonable evidence that the subcontract cannot be completed for the unpaid balance of the subcontract amount or a reasonable amount for retention that does not exceed the annual percentage retained by the department.

D. This section does not create a duty of the department to a subcontractor or material supplier other than the duty to notify pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section and does not create a cause of action in favor of a subcontractor or material supplier against this state, the department or any state employee or agent.

E. If the department directs the contractor in writing to perform changed or additional work in accordance with the terms of the construction contract and the contractor submits to the department a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract, pending a final determination of the total amount to be paid for the changed or additional work, the contractor may request payment for changed or additional work that the contractor completed during the preceding calendar month in monthly pay estimates based on the costs the contractor incurred to perform that work.  The person designated in the construction contract to certify and approve the monthly payment estimate shall make an interim determination for purposes of approval for payment of those costs and certify for payment the amount that person determines to be reasonably justified. Either party may disagree with the interim determination and may assert a claim in accordance with the terms of the construction contract.

F. If the department directs the contractor in writing to perform changed or additional work in accordance with the construction contract and the contractor submits to the department a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract and if the contractor directs the subcontractor to perform the changed or additional work in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the contractor and subcontractor and the subcontractor submits to the contractor a reasonable cost estimate of the changed or additional work as may be required under the construction contract, pending a final determination of the total amount to be paid for the changed or additional work, the subcontractor may request payment from the contractor for the changed or additional work that the subcontractor completed during the preceding calendar month in monthly pay estimates based on the costs the subcontractor incurred to perform that work.  Either party may disagree with the interim determination and may assert a claim in accordance with the terms of the agreement between the contractor and subcontractor.

At least one fee appraisal or one in-house appraisal is required for property that is offered to the public.  The director shall disclose the amount of the low appraisal before a public auction.  If at a public auction the amount of the highest responsible bid does not equal or exceed the amount of the low appraisal, the director shall advise the bidders that the amount of the low appraisal has not been met and shall continue the bidding until the amount of the highest responsible bid equals or exceeds the amount of the low appraisal.  If the highest responsible bid does not equal or exceed the amount of the low appraisal, the director shall reject all bids.  If the director is unable to sell real property pursuant to this subsection for an amount that equals or exceeds the low appraisal, the director may convey the real property by direct sale after at least thirty days' notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the real property is located at an amount that is at least equal to eighty per cent of the low appraisal, except that, if the director receives more than one offer before the termination of the thirty day notice period in an amount that is at least equal to eighty per cent of the low appraisal, the director shall sell the real property at public auction.

E. A sale pursuant to subsection B or D of this section may be made for cash or on terms of at least twenty per cent down with the balance payable in annual, biannual, quarterly or monthly installments for ten years, and the unpaid balance bears interest at a rate determined by the director.

If the director does not receive an offer within sixty days after the date of the notice, the director may dispose of the property at the best price the director can obtain for the property pursuant to procedures established by the director. For the purposes of this subsection, "net value" means the estimated market value of the property reduced by the cost to sell the property and the cost of continued maintenance of the property.

G. The director may:

1. Execute all deeds or conveyances necessary to convey any real property or interest in the real property to be conveyed under this section and shall sell any real property or interest in real property for the highest responsible bid, the direct sale price or the appraised market value of the property, as applicable.

J.

#### Section 28-7098. Appraisal; condemnation; initial offer

A. Before filing a condemnation action to acquire property for transportation purposes pursuant to this article, the department shall obtain one or more appraisals that estimate the amount of just compensation for the proposed taking and damaging of the property.

B.

1. A written offer to purchase the property or interest in the property and to pay just compensation for the property or interest in the property and for any compensable damages to any remaining property.  The offer must constitute the department's estimate of just compensation.

2. One or more appraisals that support the amount of the proposed compensation.

C. If no lease is recorded or if more than one lease is recorded for the property with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located, at least twenty days before filing an action for condemnation of property or any interest in property, the department shall provide notice of the offer and appraisal to the party having a plain and obvious commercial ownership or operational interest in substantial improvements on the property by posting the notice in plain sight at the property that may be subject to condemnation.  If a lessee that is not noted in the record of the county recorder and has a commercial ownership or operational interest in substantial improvements on the property requests a copy of the offer and appraisal the plaintiff shall promptly comply with the request upon presentation of documentation by the lessee of its interest in the property.

D. The department's initial offer of just compensation to the aggregate of those persons with an interest in the property shall not be less than the lowest of the appraisals prepared by or for the department.

E. At any time after the department has filed a condemnation action and on request, it shall promptly provide to any person in interest a copy of the appraisal of the property on which the department's most recent offer is based.

F. The superior court may waive the requirements of subsection A or B if the court determines that the plaintiff will suffer immediate and irreparable harm that outweighs the property owner's or lessee's interest.

 

 

 

#### Section 28-7099. Property repurchase; right of first refusal

A. If property is acquired for transportation purposes by agreement of the parties before the filing of a condemnation action or by stipulation before judgment in the condemnation action, the deed transferring the property shall provide the original owner or the original owner's heirs with a right of first refusal to acquire the property if the director determines that the property is not needed or used for transportation purposes at a purchase price equal to the current market value of the property.

B. The right of first refusal expires on the earlier of eight years after the date of recording the deed to the property from the original owner or sixty days after the director's determination that the property is not needed or used for transportation purposes.  If a deed transferring the property was executed before the effective date of this amendment to this section and provides for the right of repurchase, the right of repurchase expires on the earlier of eight years after the date of recording the deed to the property from the original owner or ninety days after the director's determination that the property is not needed or used for transportation purposes. An original owner or an original owner's heir who has a right to repurchase may elect to use either the right to repurchase or the right of first refusal.

C. If the director determines that the property is not needed or used for transportation purposes, if the deed transferring the property contains a right of first refusal provision and if the right of first refusal has not expired, the director shall offer the property to the original owner or the original owner's heirs at a price determined pursuant to this section. If the original owner or the original owner's heirs accept the offer within sixty days after the director determines that the property is no longer needed or used for transportation purposes, the director shall issue a quitclaim deed to the property on payment of the price. A quitclaim deed issued under this section or any deed or other document evidencing abandonment or sale by the director creates a presumption of compliance with the requirements of this section relating to the right of first refusal of the original owner or the original owner's heirs and is conclusive evidence of meeting the requirements of this section in favor of purchasers and encumbrancers for value and without actual notice. Knowledge of the grantor shall not be imputed to the grantee.

#### Section 28-7100. Dismissal of condemnation action

Before payment of the compensation and damages awarded the defendants by the court or jury, the director may abandon the proceedings and cause the condemnation action to be dismissed without prejudice, except that the director shall not initiate any eminent domain proceeding with respect to the same property for the same or a related project for at least two years after the date of the verdict or judgment.

G. The department shall proceed as follows:

1. The selection team shall review the technical proposals and score the technical proposals using the selection criteria in the request for proposals. The technical review team shall then submit a technical proposal score for each design-builder to the department. The technical review team shall reject any proposal it deems to be nonresponsive.

2. The department shall announce the technical proposal score for each design-builder, shall publicly open the sealed price proposals and shall divide each design-builder's price by the score that the selection team has given to it to obtain an adjusted score. The design-builder selected shall be that responsive and responsible design-builder whose adjusted score is the lowest.

3. If a time factor is included with the selection criteria in the request for proposals package, the department may also adjust the bids using a value of the time factor established by the department.  The value of the time factor shall be a value per day. The adjustment shall be based on the total time value. The total time value is the design-builder's proposed number of days to complete the project multiplied by the factor. The time adjusted price is the total time value plus the bid amount.  This adjustment shall be used for selection purposes only and shall not affect the department's liquidated damages schedule or incentive and disincentive program. An adjusted score shall then be obtained by dividing each design-builder's time adjusted price by the score given by the technical review team. The department shall select the responsive and responsible design-builder whose adjusted score is the lowest.

4. Unless all proposals are rejected, the board shall award the contract to the responsive and responsible design-builder with the lowest adjusted score. The board reserves the right to reject all proposals.

5. The department shall award a stipulated fee equal to four-tenths of one percent of the department's estimated cost of design and construction to each short list responsible proposer that provides a responsive, but unsuccessful proposal. If the department does not award a contract, all responsive proposers shall receive the stipulated fee.  If the department cancels the contract before reviewing the technical proposals, the department shall award each design-builder on the selected short list a stipulated fee equal to four-tenths of one percent of the department's estimated cost of design and construction. The department shall pay the stipulated fee to each proposer within ninety days after the award of the contract or the decision not to award a contract. In consideration for paying the stipulated fee, the department may use any ideas or information contained in the proposals in connection with any contract awarded for the project, or in connection with a subsequent procurement, without any obligation to pay any additional compensation to the unsuccessful proposers. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, an unsuccessful short list proposer may elect to waive the stipulated fee. If an unsuccessful short list proposer elects to waive the stipulated fee, the department may not use ideas and information contained in the proposer's proposal, except that this restriction does not prevent the department from using any idea or information if the idea or information is also included in a proposal of a short list proposer that accepts the stipulated fee.

#### Section 28-8481. Planning and zoning; military airport and ancillary military facility's operation compatibility; compliance review; penalty; definitions

A. A political subdivision that has territory in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military facility that includes property in a high noise or accident potential zone shall adopt comprehensive and general plans and school district development plans, if applicable, for property in the high noise or accident potential zone to assure development compatible with the high noise and accident potential generated by military airport and ancillary military facility operations that have or may have an adverse effect on public health and safety.  Each political subdivision, excluding school districts, shall adopt and enforce zoning regulations for property in the high noise or accident potential zone to assure development compatible with the high noise and accident potential generated by military airport and ancillary military facility operations that have or may have an adverse effect on public health and safety.

B. A political subdivision that has territory in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military facility shall incorporate sound attenuation standards pursuant to section 28-8482 into any building code in existence on or adopted after July 1, 2001 or after July 1 of the year in which the land becomes territory in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military facility.  This section does not affect or require the modification of any building permit issued before July 1, 2001 or before July 1 of the year in which the land becomes territory in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military facility.

C. A political subdivision that has territory in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military facility that includes property in a high noise or accident potential zone shall adopt, administer and enforce the zoning regulations or school district development plans authorized by subsection A of this section in the same manner as the comprehensive zoning ordinance or school district development plans of the political subdivision as provided by law, except that a variance shall not be granted without a specific finding that the purpose of military airport or ancillary military facility compatibility is preserved.

D. This section does not affect the existing authority of a political subdivision to plan and zone on the basis of noise or accident potential in the vicinity of an airport owned or controlled by the political subdivision or to adopt restrictions or limitations in addition to those required by this section applicable to territory in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military facility.

E. This section does not restrict, limit or modify, or authorize or require any political subdivision to restrict, limit or modify, the right of a landowner to undertake and complete development and use of any property under the terms and conditions of a development plan or school district development plan approved on or before December 31, 2000, or on or before December 31 of the year in which the development's property becomes territory in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military facility or pursuant to a written determination of compatibility issued by the military airport or ancillary military facility on or before December 31, 2004, by the political subdivision in whose territory or area of jurisdiction the property is located, except that the development must comply with the sound attenuation standards and specifications incorporated into any building code adopted pursuant to section 28-8482 by the political subdivision in whose territory or area of jurisdiction the development is located.

F. This section does not restrict, limit or modify, or authorize or require any political subdivision to restrict, limit or modify, the right of a landowner to undertake and complete development and use of any property located in a high noise or accident potential zone that is appurtenant to an ancillary military facility under the terms and conditions of a development plan or school district development plan approved on or before December 31, 2004 by the political subdivision in whose territory or area of jurisdiction the property is located or pursuant to a written determination of compatibility issued by the military airport or ancillary military facility on or before December 31, 2004, except that the development shall comply with the sound attenuation standards and specifications incorporated into any building code adopted pursuant to section 28-8482 by the political subdivision in whose territory or area of jurisdiction the development is located.

G. On or after July 1, 2001 or on or after December 31 of the year in which the property becomes territory in a high noise or accident potential zone, a political subdivision that has property in a high noise or accident potential zone shall notify the owner or owners of property in the high noise and accident potential zone of any additions or changes under this section to the general plan, comprehensive plan, zoning regulations or school district development plan of the political subdivision applicable to property in the high noise or accident potential zone.  The political subdivision shall provide a notice of such additions or changes by publication as provided in section 9-462.04, subsection A or section 11-814, subsection D, including a statement that the property is located in a high noise or accident potential zone, at least thirty days before final approval of the addition to or change in the general plan, permitted land uses, zoning regulation or school district development plan and within thirty days following the final approval of such an addition to or change in the general plan, permitted land uses, zoning regulation or school district development plan.

H. Any property owner described in subsection G of this section shall notify potential purchasers of the property and any potential lessees or renters that the property is located in a high noise and accident potential zone and is subject to the requirements of this section.

I. If a political subdivision includes property in the high noise or accident potential zone of a military airport or ancillary military facility, the political subdivision shall send notice to the attorney general of any approval, adoption or readoption of, or major amendment to, the general or comprehensive plan that impacts property in the high noise or accident potential zone of a military airport or ancillary military facility within three business days after the approval, adoption or readoption.  If the attorney general determines the approval, adoption or readoption of the general or comprehensive plan or the major amendment to the general or comprehensive plan is not in compliance with subsection J of this section, the attorney general shall notify the political subdivision by certified mail, return receipt requested, of the determination of noncompliance.  Within thirty days after the receipt of a determination of noncompliance by the attorney general as prescribed by this section, the governing body of the political subdivision shall reconsider any approval, adoption or readoption of, or major amendment to, the general or comprehensive plan that impacts property in the high noise or accident potential zone of a military airport or ancillary military facility.  If the governing body reaffirms a prior action subject to an attorney general's determination of noncompliance pursuant to this section, the attorney general may institute a civil action pursuant to subsection L of this section.  If a political subdivision timely sends notice pursuant to this subsection and the attorney general fails to timely notify the political subdivision of a determination of noncompliance, the general or comprehensive plan or major amendment to the general or comprehensive plan shall be deemed to comply with subsection J of this section.

J. The attorney general shall determine compliance with this section in accordance with the following requirements applicable to zoning and development in a high noise or accident potential zone and to zoning and development in accident potential zone one and accident potential zone two. Compliance with respect to territory located in the arrival and departure corridor but outside the accident potential zone one, two and noise contour lines as described in section 28-8461, paragraph 9, subdivision (c) shall be determined in accordance with the requirements applicable to territory located in the 65-69 day-night sound level as listed below. Compliance with respect to the property described in section 28-8461, paragraph 9, subdivision (b) shall be determined in accordance with the compatible land use plan in the joint land use study completed in February 2004.  If the political subdivision and the military airport mutually agree that an individual use is compatible and consistent with the high noise or accident potential of the military airport or ancillary military facility, as applicable, the use shall be deemed to comply with this subsection. Alternatively, for an individual use or a plan for development submitted to a military airport or ancillary military facility before December 31, 2004, this subsection does not preclude the military airport from determining that the individual use or plan for development is compatible and consistent with the high noise or accident potential zone of the military airport or ancillary military facility.
