#### Section 23-212. Knowingly employing unauthorized aliens; prohibition; false and frivolous complaints; violation; classification; license suspension and revocation; affirmative defense

A. An employer shall not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien.  If, in the case when an employer uses a contract, subcontract or other independent contractor agreement to obtain the labor of an alien in this state, the employer knowingly contracts with an unauthorized alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates this subsection.

B. The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form for a person to allege a violation of subsection A of this section. The complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's social security number on the complaint form or to have the complaint form notarized.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form that an employer allegedly knowingly employs an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has violated subsection A of this section.  If a complaint is received but is not submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has violated subsection A of this section. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form.  The attorney general or county attorney shall not investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color or national origin.  A complaint that is submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien is or was employed by the employer.  The county sheriff or any other local law enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.  When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c). A state, county or local official shall not attempt to independently make a final determination on whether an alien is authorized to work in the United States. An alien's immigration status or work authorization status shall be verified with the federal government pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c).  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous complaint under this subsection is guilty of a class 3 misdemeanor.

C. If, after an investigation, the attorney general or county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and frivolous:

1. The attorney general or county attorney shall notify the United States immigration and customs enforcement of the unauthorized alien.

2. The attorney general or county attorney shall notify the local law enforcement agency of the unauthorized alien.

3. The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection D of this section if the complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.

D. An action for a violation of subsection A of this section shall be brought against the employer by the county attorney in the county where the unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.  The county attorney shall not bring an action against any employer for any violation of subsection A of this section that occurs before January 1, 2008.  A second violation of this section shall be based only on an unauthorized alien who is or was employed by the employer after an action has been brought for a violation of subsection A of this section or section 23-212.01, subsection A.

E. For any action in superior court under this section, the court shall expedite the action, including assigning the hearing at the earliest practicable date.

F. On a finding of a violation of subsection A of this section:

1. For a first violation, as described in paragraph 3 of this subsection, the court:

(a) Shall order the employer to terminate the employment of all unauthorized aliens.

(b) Shall order the employer to be subject to a three year probationary period for the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work.  During the probationary period the employer shall file quarterly reports in the form provided in section 23-722.01 with the county attorney of each new employee who is hired by the employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work.

(c) Shall order the employer to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county attorney within three business days after the order is issued. The affidavit shall state that the employer has terminated the employment of all unauthorized aliens in this state and that the employer will not intentionally or knowingly employ an unauthorized alien in this state.  The court shall order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses subject to this subdivision that are held by the employer if the employer fails to file a signed sworn affidavit with the county attorney within three business days after the order is issued. All licenses that are suspended under this subdivision shall remain suspended until the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county attorney.  Notwithstanding any other law, on filing of the affidavit the suspended licenses shall be reinstated immediately by the appropriate agencies.  For the purposes of this subdivision, the licenses that are subject to suspension under this subdivision are all licenses that are held by the employer specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work.  If the employer does not hold a license specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject to suspension under this subdivision are all licenses that are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of business.  On receipt of the court's order and notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's order.  The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the copy pursuant to subsection G of this section.

(d) May order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in subdivision (c) of this paragraph that are held by the employer for not to exceed ten business days.  The court shall base its decision to suspend under this subdivision on any evidence or information submitted to it during the action for a violation of this subsection and shall consider the following factors, if relevant:

(i) The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the employer.

(ii) Any prior misconduct by the employer.

(iii) The degree of harm resulting from the violation.

(iv) Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply with any applicable requirements.

(v) The duration of the violation.

(vi) The role of the directors, officers or principals of the employer in the violation.

(vii) Any other factors the court deems appropriate.

2. For a second violation, as described in paragraph 3 of this subsection, the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that are held by the employer specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work.  If the employer does not hold a license specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the employer's business in general, the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order and notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.

3. The violation shall be considered:

(a) A first violation by an employer at a business location if the violation did not occur during a probationary period ordered by the court under this subsection or section 23-212.01, subsection F for that employer's business location.

(b) A second violation by an employer at a business location if the violation occurred during a probationary period ordered by the court under this subsection or section 23-212.01, subsection F for that employer's business location.

G. The attorney general shall maintain copies of court orders that are received pursuant to subsection F of this section and shall maintain a database of the employers and business locations that have a first violation of subsection A of this section and make the court orders available on the attorney general's website.

H. On determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider only the federal government's determination pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c). The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's lawful status.  The court may take judicial notice of the federal government's determination and may request the federal government to provide automated or testimonial verification pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c).

I. For the purposes of this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization of an employee through the e-verify program creates a rebuttable presumption that an employer did not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien.

J. For the purposes of this section, an employer that establishes that it has complied in good faith with the requirements of 8 United States Code section 1324a(b) establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not knowingly employ an unauthorized alien.  An employer is considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 United States Code section 1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if there is a good faith attempt to comply with the requirements.

K. It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection A of this section that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other evidence the substantial elements of the violation.  An employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden of proving the following by a preponderance of the evidence:

1. The idea of committing the violation started with law enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the employer.

2. The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and induced the employer to commit the violation.

3. The employer was not predisposed to commit the violation before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and induced the employer to commit the violation.

L. An employer does not establish entrapment if the employer was predisposed to violate subsection A of this section and the law enforcement officers or their agents merely provided the employer with an opportunity to commit the violation.  It is not entrapment for law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement officers and their agents may be considered in determining if an employer has proven entrapment.

 

#### Section 23-212.01. Intentionally employing unauthorized aliens; prohibition; false and frivolous complaints; violation; classification; license suspension and revocation; affirmative defense

A. An employer shall not intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  If, in the case when an employer uses a contract, subcontract or other independent contractor agreement to obtain the labor of an alien in this state, the employer intentionally contracts with an unauthorized alien or with a person who employs or contracts with an unauthorized alien to perform the labor, the employer violates this subsection.

B. The attorney general shall prescribe a complaint form for a person to allege a violation of subsection A of this section.  The complainant shall not be required to list the complainant's social security number on the complaint form or to have the complaint form notarized.  On receipt of a complaint on a prescribed complaint form that an employer allegedly intentionally employs an unauthorized alien, the attorney general or county attorney shall investigate whether the employer has violated subsection A of this section. If a complaint is received but is not submitted on a prescribed complaint form, the attorney general or county attorney may investigate whether the employer has violated subsection A of this section.  This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit the filing of anonymous complaints that are not submitted on a prescribed complaint form. The attorney general or county attorney shall not investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color or national origin. A complaint that is submitted to a county attorney shall be submitted to the county attorney in the county in which the alleged unauthorized alien is or was employed by the employer.  The county sheriff or any other local law enforcement agency may assist in investigating a complaint.  When investigating a complaint, the attorney general or county attorney shall verify the work authorization of the alleged unauthorized alien with the federal government pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c).  A state, county or local official shall not attempt to independently make a final determination on whether an alien is authorized to work in the United States. An alien's immigration status or work authorization status shall be verified with the federal government pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c).  A person who knowingly files a false and frivolous complaint under this subsection is guilty of a class 3 misdemeanor.

C. If, after an investigation, the attorney general or county attorney determines that the complaint is not false and frivolous:

1. The attorney general or county attorney shall notify the United States immigration and customs enforcement of the unauthorized alien.

2. The attorney general or county attorney shall notify the local law enforcement agency of the unauthorized alien.

3. The attorney general shall notify the appropriate county attorney to bring an action pursuant to subsection D of this section if the complaint was originally filed with the attorney general.

D. An action for a violation of subsection A of this section shall be brought against the employer by the county attorney in the county where the unauthorized alien employee is or was employed by the employer.  The county attorney shall not bring an action against any employer for any violation of subsection A of this section that occurs before January 1, 2008.  A second violation of this section shall be based only on an unauthorized alien who is or was employed by the employer after an action has been brought for a violation of subsection A of this section or section 23-212, subsection A.

E. For any action in superior court under this section, the court shall expedite the action, including assigning the hearing at the earliest practicable date.

F. On a finding of a violation of subsection A of this section:

1. For a first violation, as described in paragraph 3 of this subsection, the court shall:

(a) Order the employer to terminate the employment of all unauthorized aliens.

(b) Order the employer to be subject to a five year probationary period for the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work. During the probationary period the employer shall file quarterly reports in the form provided in section 23-722.01 with the county attorney of each new employee who is hired by the employer at the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work.

(c) Order the appropriate agencies to suspend all licenses described in subdivision (d) of this paragraph that are held by the employer for a minimum of ten days.  The court shall base its decision on the length of the suspension under this subdivision on any evidence or information submitted to it during the action for a violation of this subsection and shall consider the following factors, if relevant:

(i) The number of unauthorized aliens employed by the employer.

(ii) Any prior misconduct by the employer.

(iii) The degree of harm resulting from the violation.

(iv) Whether the employer made good faith efforts to comply with any applicable requirements.

(v) The duration of the violation.

All licenses that are suspended under this subdivision for failing to file a signed sworn affidavit shall remain suspended until the employer files a signed sworn affidavit with the county attorney.  For the purposes of this subdivision, the licenses that are subject to suspension under this subdivision are all licenses that are held by the employer specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work.  If the employer does not hold a license specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the employer's business in general, the licenses that are subject to suspension under this subdivision are all licenses that are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of business.  On receipt of the court's order and notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate agencies shall suspend the licenses according to the court's order.  The court shall send a copy of the court's order to the attorney general and the attorney general shall maintain the copy pursuant to subsection G of this section.

2. For a second violation, as described in paragraph 3 of this subsection, the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that are held by the employer specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work.  If the employer does not hold a license specific to the business location where the unauthorized alien performed work, but a license is necessary to operate the employer's business in general, the court shall order the appropriate agencies to permanently revoke all licenses that are held by the employer at the employer's primary place of business. On receipt of the order and notwithstanding any other law, the appropriate agencies shall immediately revoke the licenses.

H. On determining whether an employee is an unauthorized alien, the court shall consider only the federal government's determination pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c).  The federal government's determination creates a rebuttable presumption of the employee's lawful status.  The court may take judicial notice of the federal government's determination and may request the federal government to provide automated or testimonial verification pursuant to 8 United States Code section 1373(c).

I. For the purposes of this section, proof of verifying the employment authorization of an employee through the e-verify program creates a rebuttable presumption that an employer did not intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.

J. For the purposes of this section, an employer that establishes that it has complied in good faith with the requirements of 8 United States Code section 1324a(b) establishes an affirmative defense that the employer did not intentionally employ an unauthorized alien.  An employer is considered to have complied with the requirements of 8 United States Code section 1324a(b), notwithstanding an isolated, sporadic or accidental technical or procedural failure to meet the requirements, if there is a good faith attempt to comply with the requirements.

K. It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection A of this section that the employer was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the employer must admit by the employer's testimony or other evidence the substantial elements of the violation.  An employer who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden of proving the following by a preponderance of the evidence:

1. The idea of committing the violation started with law enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the employer.

2. The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and induced the employer to commit the violation.

The report shall include proposed administrative regulations the commission deems appropriate to complete the report of the wage board and to protect and maintain the minimum fair wage standards established. The administrative regulations shall include, among other things, regulations defining and governing learners and apprentices, their rates, number, piece rates or their relation to time rates, overtime or part-time rates, bonuses or special pay for special or extra work.

C. Within twenty days after the date of service of summons on the commission a transcript of the evidence and testimony offered at the hearing shall be filed with the clerk of the court, and the review shall be had upon the transcript offered and upon other evidence. The review shall not stay the order of the commission until the order is reversed, vacated or modified by the court.

D. Upon setting aside a decision of the commission, the court may recommit the controversy and remand the record in the case for further proceedings.

#### Section 23-327. Action by employee for recovery of wages; amount of recovery

If a minor is paid less than the minimum fair wage to which such minor is entitled under a mandatory minimum fair wage order, such minor may recover in a civil action an amount which is treble the full amount of the minimum wage, together with costs and a reasonable attorney's fee to be allowed by the court on the basis of time and effort expended by counsel in behalf of the plaintiff-employee if judgment is rendered against the employer, less any amount actually paid to the employee by the employer.

The commission is authorized to enforce and implement this article and may promulgate regulations consistent with this article to do so.  For purposes of this section: (1) "article shall mean both article 8 and article 8.1 of this chapter; (2) "earned paid sick time" is as defined in section 23-371, Arizona Revised Statutes; (3) "employer" shall refer to the definition of employer in section 23-362, Arizona Revised Statutes, for purposes of minimum wage enforcement and shall refer to the definition of employer in section 23-371, Arizona Revised Statutes, for purposes of earned paid sick time enforcement; and (4) "retaliation" shall mean denial of any right guaranteed under article 8 and article 8.1 of this chapter and any threat, discharge, suspension, demotion, reduction of hours, or any other adverse action against an employee for the exercise of any right guaranteed herein including any sanctions against an employee who is the recipient of public benefits for rights guaranteed herein.  Retaliation shall also include interference with or punishment for in any manner participating in or assisting an investigation, proceeding or hearing under this article.

B. No employer or other person shall discriminate or subject any person to retaliation for asserting any claim or right under this article, for assisting any other person in doing so, or for informing any person about their rights.  Taking adverse action against a person within ninety days of a person's engaging in the foregoing activities shall raise a presumption that such action was retaliation, which may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that such action was taken for other permissible reasons.

C. Any person or organization may file an administrative complaint with the commission charging that an employer has violated this article as to any employee or other person.  When the commission receives a complaint, the commission may review records regarding all employees at the employer's worksite in order to protect the identity of any employee identified in the complaint and to determine whether a pattern of violations has occurred.  The name of any employee identified in a complaint to the commission shall be kept confidential as long as possible.  Where the commission determines that an employee's name must be disclosed in order to investigate a complaint further, it may so do only with the employee's consent.

D. Employers shall post notices in the workplace, in such format specified by the commission, notifying employees of their rights under this article.  Employers shall provide their business name, address, and telephone number in writing to employees upon hire.  Employers shall maintain payroll records showing the hours worked for each day worked, and the wages and earned paid sick time paid to all employees for a period of four years. Failure to do so shall raise a rebuttable presumption that the employer did not pay the required minimum wage rate or earned paid sick time. The commission may by regulation reduce or waive the recordkeeping and posting requirements herein for any categories of small employers whom it finds would be unreasonably burdened by such requirements. Employers shall permit the commission or a law enforcement officer to inspect and copy payroll or other business records, shall permit them to interview employees away from the worksite, and shall not hinder any investigation.  Such information provided shall keep confidential except as is required to prosecute violations of this article.  Employers shall permit an employee or his or her designated representative to inspect and copy payroll records pertaining to that employee.

E. A civil action to enforce this article may be maintained in a court of competent jurisdiction by a law enforcement officer or by any private party injured by a violation of this article.

F. Any employer who violates recordkeeping, posting, or other requirements that the commission may establish under this article shall be subject to a civil penalty of at least $250 dollars for a first violation, and at least $1000 dollars for each subsequent or willful violation and may, if the commission or court determines appropriate, be subject to special monitoring and inspections.

G. Any employer who fails to pay the wages or earned paid sick time required under this article shall be required to pay the employee the balance of the wages or earned paid sick time owed, including interest thereon, and an additional amount equal to twice the underpaid wages or earned paid sick time.  Any employer who retaliates against an employee or other person in violation of this article shall be required to pay the employee an amount set by the commission or a court sufficient to compensate the employee and deter future violations, but not less than one hundred fifty dollars for each day that the violation continued or until legal judgment is final.  The commission and the courts shall have the authority to order payment of such unpaid wages, unpaid earned sick time, other amounts, and civil penalties and to order any other appropriate legal or equitable relief for violations of this article.  Civil penalties shall be retained by the agency that recovered them and used to finance activities to enforce this article.  A prevailing plaintiff shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs of suit.

H. A civil action to enforce this article may be commenced no later than two years after a violation last occurs, or three years in the case of a willful violation, and may encompass all violations that occurred as part of a continuing course of employer conduct regardless of their date.  The statute of limitations shall be tolled during any investigation of an employer by the commission or other law enforcement officer, but such investigation shall not bar a person from bringing a civil action under this article.  No verbal or written agreement or employment contract may waive any rights under this article.

I. The legislature may by statute raise the minimum wage established under this article, extend coverage, or increase penalties.  A county, city, or town may by ordinance regulate minimum wages and benefits within its geographic boundaries but may not provide for a minimum wage lower than that prescribed in this article.  State agencies, counties, cities, towns and other political subdivisions of the state may consider violations of this article in determining whether employers may receive or renew public contracts, financial assistance or licenses.  This article shall be liberally construed in favor of its purposes and shall not limit the authority of the legislature or any other body to adopt any law or policy that requires payment of higher or supplemental wages or benefits, or that extends such protections to employers or employees not covered by this article.

 

 

#### Section 23-365. Reliance on administrative rule or regulation

 

(Added with a 1998 Prop. 105 clause pursuant to L07, Ch. 272)

 

In any action or proceeding commenced on or after January 1, 2007, an employer or other entity is not liable if the employer or entity fails to pay the minimum wage if the employer or entity proves that the act or omission was in good faith, conformed with and relied on an administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval or interpretation, administrative practice or enforcement policy issued by the commission pursuant to and in accordance with the commission’s authority under this article.  This defense, if established, bars the action or proceeding, notwithstanding that after the act or omission, the administrative regulation, order, ruling, approval, interpretation, practice or enforcement policy is modified or rescinded or is determined by judicial authority to be invalid.

C. In determining the number of employees performing work for an employer for compensation during a given week, all employees performing work for compensation on a full-time, part-time or temporary basis shall be counted.  In situations in which the number of employees who work for an employer for compensation per week fluctuates above and below 15 employees per week over the course of the year, an employer is required to provide earned paid sick time pursuant to subsection A of this section if it maintained 15 or more employees on the payroll for some portion of a day in each of 20 different calendar weeks, whether or not the weeks were consecutive, in either the current or the preceding year (irrespective of whether the same individuals were in employment in each day).

D. All employees shall accrue earned paid sick time as follows:

1. Earned paid sick time as provided in this section shall begin to accrue at the commencement of employment or on July 1, 2017, whichever is later.  An employer may provide all earned paid sick time that an employee is expected to accrue in a year at the beginning of the year.

2. An employee may use earned paid sick time as it is accrued, except that an employer may require an employee hired after July 1, 2017, to wait until the ninetieth calendar day after commencing employment before using accrued earned paid sick time, unless otherwise permitted by the employer.

3. Employees who are exempt from overtime requirements under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 United States Code section 213(A)(1)) will be assumed to work 40 hours in each work week for purposes of earned paid sick time accrual unless their normal work week is less than 40 hours, in which case earned paid sick time accrues based upon that normal work week.

4. Earned paid sick time shall be carried over to the following year, subject to the limitations on usage in subsections A and B.  Alternatively, in lieu of carryover of unused earned paid sick time from one year to the next, an employer may pay an employee for unused earned paid sick time at the end of a year and provide the employee with an amount of earned paid sick time that meets or exceeds the requirements of this article that is available for the employee's immediate use at the beginning of the subsequent year.

5.

E. Any employer with a paid leave policy, such as a paid time off policy, who makes available an amount of paid leave sufficient to meet the accrual requirements of this section that may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as earned paid sick time under this article is not required to provide additional paid sick time.

F. Nothing in this article shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement or other separation from employment for accrued earned paid sick time that has not been used.

 

#### Section 23-373. Use of earned paid sick time

 

(Caution:  1998 Prop. 105 applies)

 

A. Earned paid sick time shall be provided to an employee by an employer for:

1. An employee's mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; an employee's need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; an employee's need for preventive medical care;

2. Care of a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; care of a family member who needs medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury or health condition; care of a family member who needs preventive medical care;

3. Closure of the employee's place of business by order of a public official due to a public health emergency or an employee's need to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency, or care for oneself or a family member when it has been determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care provider that the employee's or family member's presence in the community may jeopardize the health of others because of his or her exposure to a communicable disease, whether or not the employee or family member has actually contracted the communicable disease; or

4. Notwithstanding section 13-4439, Arizona Revised Statutes, absence necessary due to domestic violence, sexual violence, abuse or stalking, provided the leave is to allow the employee to obtain for the employee or the employee's family member:

C. When the use of earned paid sick time is foreseeable, the employee shall make a good faith effort to provide notice of the need for such time to the employer in advance of the use of the earned paid sick time and shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the use of earned paid sick time in a manner that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.

D. An employer that requires notice of the need to use earned paid sick time where the need is not foreseeable shall provide a written policy that contains procedures for the employee to provide notice.  An employer that has not provided to the employee a copy of its written policy for providing such notice shall not deny earned paid sick time to the employee based on non-compliance with such a policy.

E. An employer may not require, as a condition of an employee's taking earned paid sick time, that the employee search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is using earned paid sick time.

F. Earned paid sick time may be used in the smaller of hourly increments or the smallest increment that the employer's payroll system uses to account for absences or use of other time.

G. For earned paid sick time of three or more consecutive work days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the earned paid sick time has been used for a purpose covered by subsection A. Documentation signed by a heath care professional indicating that earned paid sick time is necessary shall be considered reasonable documentation for purposes of this section.  In cases of domestic violence, sexual violence, abuse or stalking, one of the following types of documentation selected by the employee shall be considered reasonable documentation:

1. A police report indicating that the employee or the employee's family member was a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, abuse or stalking;

2. A protective order; injunction against harassment; a general court order; or other evidence from a court or prosecuting attorney that the employee or employee's family member appeared, or is scheduled to appear, in court in connection with an incident of domestic violence, sexual violence, abuse, or stalking;

3. A signed statement from a domestic violence or sexual violence program or victim services organization affirming that the employee or employee's family member is receiving services related to domestic violence, sexual violence, abuse, or stalking;

5. A signed statement from an attorney, member of the clergy, or a medical or other professional affirming that the employee or employee's family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, abuse, or stalking; or

6. An employee's written statement affirming that the employee or the employee's family member is a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, abuse, or stalking, and that the leave was taken for one of the purposes of subsection A, paragraph 4 of this section.  The employee's written statement, by itself, is reasonable documentation for absences under this paragraph.  The written statement does not need to be in an affidavit format or notarized, but shall be legible if handwritten and shall reasonably make clear the employee's identity, and if applicable, the employee's relationship to the family member.

H. The provision of documentation under subsection G does not waive or diminish any confidential or privileged communications between a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, abuse, or stalking with one or more of the individuals named in subsection G.

I. An employer may not require that documentation under subsection G explain the nature of the health condition or the details of the domestic violence, sexual violence, abuse or stalking.

Where appropriate such standards or rules shall also prescribe suitable protective equipment and control or technological procedures to be used in connection with such hazards and shall provide for monitoring or measuring employee exposure at such locations and intervals and in such manner as may be necessary for the protection of employees. In addition, where appropriate, any such standards or rules shall prescribe the type and frequency of medical examinations or other tests which shall be made available, by the employer or at his cost, to employees exposed to such hazards in order to most effectively determine whether the health of such employees is adversely affected by such exposure.

D. In case of conflict between standards and rules, the rules shall take precedence.

E. Any person who may be adversely affected by a standard or rule issued under this article may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such standard or rule is promulgated file a complaint challenging the validity of such standard or rule with the superior court in the county in which the person resides or has his principal place of business, for a judicial review of such standard or rule.

The determinations of the commission shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.

#### Section 23-411. Temporary and experimental variances

A. Any employer may apply to the commission for a temporary order granting a variance from a standard or regulation or any provision thereof promulgated under this article.

B. Such temporary order shall be granted only if the employer files an application which meets the requirements of subsection C of this section and establishes all of the following:

1. He is unable to comply with a standard or regulation by its effective date because of unavailability of professional or technical personnel or of materials and equipment needed to come into compliance with the standard or regulation or because necessary construction or alteration of facilities cannot be completed by the effective date.

2. He is taking all available steps to safeguard his employees against the hazards covered by the standard or regulation.

3. He has an effective program for coming into compliance with the standard or regulation as quickly as practicable.  Any temporary order issued under this section shall prescribe the practices, means, methods, operations and processes which the employer must adopt and use while the order is in effect and state in detail his program for coming into compliance with the standard or regulation. Such a temporary order may be granted only after notice to employees and an opportunity for a hearing before the commission. A hearing must be requested within twenty days of such notice to employees. The commission may issue one interim order to be effective until a decision is made on the basis of the hearing. No temporary order may be in effect for longer than the period needed by the employer to achieve compliance with the standard or regulation or six months, whichever is shorter, except that such an order may be renewed not more than once so long as the requirements of this section are met and if an application for renewal is filed at least sixty days prior to the expiration date of the order. No interim renewal of an order may remain in effect for longer than one hundred eighty days.

4. A statement of when he expects to be able to comply with the standard or regulation and what steps he has taken and what steps he will take with dates specified to come into compliance with the standard or regulation.

5. A certification that he has informed his employees of the application by giving a copy thereof to their authorized representative, posting a statement giving a summary of the application and specifying where a copy may be examined at the place or places where notices to employees are normally posted and by other appropriate means. A description of how employees have been informed shall be contained in the certification. The information to employees shall also inform them of their right to petition the commission for a hearing.

D. The commission is authorized to grant an experimental variance from any standard or regulation or portion thereof whenever it determines that such variance is necessary to permit an employer to participate in an experiment approved by the commission and designed to demonstrate or validate new and improved techniques to safeguard the safety or health of workers. An employer applying for an experimental variance must comply with the requirements of subsection C, paragraphs 1, 3 and 5 of this section.

#### Section 23-412. Permanent variances

Any affected employer may apply to the commission for a rule or order for a variance from a standard or regulation promulgated under this article. Affected employees shall be given notice of each such application and an opportunity to participate in a hearing. The commission shall issue such rule or order if it determines on the record, after opportunity for an inspection where appropriate and a hearing before the commission that the proponent of the variance has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the conditions, practices, means, methods, operations or processes used or proposed to be used by an employer will provide employment and places of employment to his employees which are as safe and healthful as those which would prevail if he complied with the standard or regulation. The rule or order so issued shall prescribe the conditions the employer must maintain, the practices, means, methods, operations and processes which he must adopt and utilize to the extent they differ from the standard or regulation in question. Such a rule or order may be modified or revoked upon application by an employer, employees or by the commission on its own motion, in the manner prescribed for its issuance under this section at any time after six months from its issuance.

#### Section 23-414. Emergency temporary standards

A. The commission may provide for emergency temporary standards or regulations to take immediate effect upon filing with the secretary of state, if the commission or the United States occupational safety and health administration determines that employees are exposed to grave danger from exposure to substances or agents determined to be toxic or physically harmful or from new hazards and that such emergency standard or regulation is necessary to protect employees from such danger.

B. Such emergency temporary standards or regulations shall be effective until superseded by standards or regulations promulgated in accordance with the procedures prescribed in section 23-410.

C. Upon filing such a standard or regulation with the secretary of state the commission shall commence a proceeding in accordance with section 23-410 and the emergency temporary standard or regulation shall serve as a proposed standard or regulation for the proceeding. The commission shall promulgate a standard or regulation under this subsection no later than six months after filing of the emergency temporary standard or regulation.

#### Section 23-417. Enforcement procedure

A. If the director, following an inspection or investigation, issues a citation pursuant to section 23-415 the director, within a reasonable time after termination of the inspection or investigation, shall notify the employer by mail of any penalty proposed to be assessed pursuant to section 23-418 and that the employer has fifteen working days within which to notify the director in writing if the employer wishes to contest the citation or proposed assessment of penalty. If the employer fails to notify the director in writing within fifteen working days of receipt of the notice that the employer intends to contest the citation or penalty and a notice is not filed by any employee or representative of employees pursuant to subsection D of this section within such time, the citation and the assessment, as proposed, shall be a final order of the commission and not subject to review by any court or agency, except that the director may excuse any late notification to contest a citation only if the employer to whom the notice was sent shows by clear and convincing evidence that the notice was not received.

B. The period allowed for correction of a violation shall not begin to run until the entry of a final order in the case of any review proceedings pursuant to this section initiated by the employer in good faith and not solely for delay or avoidance of penalties. If the division has reason to believe an employer has failed to correct a violation for which a citation has been issued within the period allowed, the director shall notify the employer by mail of such failure, of the penalty proposed to be assessed pursuant to section 23-418 and that the employer has fifteen working days within which to notify the director in writing if the employer wishes to contest the notification or proposed assessment of penalty. If the employer fails to notify the director in writing within fifteen working days of receipt of the notice that the employer intends to contest the notice or penalty, the notice and assessment, as proposed, shall be deemed a final order of the commission and not subject to review by any court or agency.

C. Any employer who corrects the violations for which a citation was issued within the period allowed shall so notify the director in writing.

D. Any affected employee or employee representative may request a hearing to appeal the period allowed an employer to abate a particular violation pursuant to section 23-420 if the affected employee or employee representative files the appeal with the director within the abatement period allowed in the citation or within fifteen days after the date of receipt of the citation, whichever is shorter.

E. On a showing by an employer of a good faith effort to comply with the abatement requirements of a citation, and that abatement has not been completed because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the employer, the commission or its authorized designee, after an opportunity for a hearing as provided in section 23-420, shall issue an order affirming or modifying the abatement requirements in such citation. The rules of procedure prescribed by the commission shall provide affected employees or representatives of affected employees an opportunity to participate as parties to hearings under this subsection.

#### Section 23-418. Penalties; violation; classification

A. Any employer who wilfully or repeatedly violates the requirements of section 23-403 or any standard or regulation adopted pursuant to section 23-410 or 23-414 or this article may be assessed a civil penalty for each wilful violation of not more than the maximum civil penalty, but not less than the minimum civil penalty, for wilful or repeated violations adopted by the United States occupational safety and health administration pursuant to the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act improvements act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74; 129 Stat. 599).

D. Any employer that fails to correct a violation for which a citation has been issued within the abatement period allowed for its correction, which shall be suspended in case of a review proceeding before an administrative law judge or the review board initiated by the employer in good faith and not solely for delay or avoidance of penalties, may be assessed a civil penalty of not more than the maximum civil penalty for abatement violations adopted by the United States occupational safety and health administration pursuant to the federal civil penalties inflation adjustment act improvements act of 2015 (P.L. 114-74; 129 Stat. 599) for each day during which such failure or violation continues after the abatement date.

E. Any employer that knowingly violates the requirements of section 23-403 or any standard or regulation adopted pursuant to section 23-410 or 23-414 or this article and that violation causes death to an employee is guilty of a class 6 felony, except that if the conviction is for a second or subsequent violation the employer is guilty of a class 5 felony.

After an order or decision on a civil penalty becomes final pursuant to section 23-417, 23-421 or 23-423, the civil penalty shall act as a judgment against the employer. The commission shall file the civil penalty in the office of the clerk of the superior court in any county in this state and the clerk shall enter the civil penalty in the civil order book and judgment docket. When the civil penalty is filed and entered it is a lien for eight years after the date of the final order or decision on the property of the employer located in the county. Execution may issue on the civil penalty within eight years in the same manner and with like effect as a judgment of the superior court. The civil penalty judgment shall accrue interest pursuant to section 44-1201. The commission may recover reasonable attorney fees incurred pursuant to this section.

(b) In the event of death, to the employee's dependents.  The requirement of this subdivision is satisfied if an employee did not have any dependents for which compensation benefits would have otherwise been paid under chapter 6 of this title.

3. The violation for which the employer is assessed a penalty under section 23-418, subsection A did not result from the injured or deceased employee's disobedience to specific instructions given to the employee regarding the job condition causing the employee's injury or death or relating to the safety standards applicable to that job condition.

B. Each additional penalty assessed under subsection A of this section shall be paid to the injured employee, or in the event of death, the employee's dependents or the employee's estate if the employee did not have any dependents, in addition to the benefits paid under chapter 6 of this title.

C. If an employer requests a hearing on an additional penalty assessed under this section, the commission shall refer the request for hearing to the office of administrative hearings for determination. An additional penalty under this section that becomes final shall operate as a judgment against the employer and may be enforced by either the commission or the injured employee, or in the case of death, the employee's dependents or the employee's estate if the employee did not have any dependents, and all lawful remedies for the collection of judgments, including provisional remedies, shall be available. This section does not create any right of action or recovery against the employer's workers' compensation insurance carrier, and the additional penalty provided by this section is not a compensation benefit under chapter 6 of this title and is not subject to the payment of attorney fees.

A. The superior court has jurisdiction upon filing of a verified complaint by the commission to restrain any conditions or practices in any place of employment which are such that a danger exists which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm immediately or before the imminence of such danger can be eliminated through the enforcement procedures otherwise provided by this article. Any order issued under this section may require such steps to be taken as may be necessary to avoid, correct or remove such imminent danger and prohibit the employment or presence of any individual in locations or under conditions where such imminent danger exists, except individuals whose presence is necessary to avoid, correct or remove such imminent danger or to maintain the capacity of a continuous process operation to resume normal operations or where a cessation of operations is necessary, to permit such to be accomplished in a safe and orderly manner.

B. Upon the filing of any such complaint the superior court has jurisdiction to grant such injunctive relief or temporary restraining order pending the outcome of an enforcement proceeding pursuant to this article. The proceeding shall be as provided by the rules of civil procedure.

C. Whenever, and as soon as the commission or its authorized representative concludes that conditions or practices described in subsection A exist in any place of employment, it shall inform the affected employees and employers of the danger and that it is recommending that relief be sought.

D. If the commission or its authorized representative arbitrarily or capriciously fails to seek relief under this section, any employee who may be injured by reason of such failure or the representative of such employees may bring an action against the commission in superior court for a writ of mandamus to compel the commission to seek such an order and for such further relief as may be appropriate.

The administrative law judge assigned to hear a case arising out of this article shall either be employed or contracted by the office of administrative hearings.

D. At least five days before any hearing, notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given to all parties in interest by mail at their last known address. The hearing shall be held in the county where the violation has occurred or such other place as selected by the administrative law judge.

## Chapter 4 - EMPLOYMENT SECURITY

### Article 1 - Definitions

#### Section 23-601. Declaration of policy

As a guide to the interpretation and application of this chapter, the public policy of this state is declared to be as follows: Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals and welfare of the people of this state. Involuntary unemployment is therefore a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which now so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his family. The achievement of social security requires protection against this greatest hazard of economic life. This can be provided by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment, thus maintaining purchasing power and limiting the serious social consequences of poor relief assistance. The legislature, therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this state require the enactment of this measure, under the police powers of the state, for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.

If the base-period employer is a governmental entity, the total charges against such governmental base-period employer for extended benefits paid for weeks of unemployment beginning on or after January 1, 1979, shall be used as a factor in determining the future contribution rate of such governmental employer.

2. One-half of the extended benefits paid to an individual which are based on base-period wages paid by an employing unit other than a governmental entity referred to in section 23-750, subsection A, paragraph 2, which is making payments in lieu of contributions shall not be reimbursable to the department by such employing unit.

A. Whenever in this chapter a period of time is specified for submitting any payment, appeal, application, request, notice, objection, petition, report or other information or document, the department may extend such period of time if the party establishes to the satisfaction of the department that the failure to make a timely submission was due to the delay or other action of the United States postal service or its successor.

B. The department shall adopt and may amend, modify or repeal regulations governing the extension of time authorized by this section.

#### Section 23-644. Reciprocal arrangements

A. The department may enter into reciprocal arrangements with appropriate and duly authorized agencies of other states or of the federal government, or both, whereby:

1. Services performed by an individual for a single employing unit for which services are customarily performed in more than one state shall be deemed services performed entirely within any one of the states in which any part of the individual's service is performed, or in which the individual has his residence, or in which the employing unit maintains a place of business, provided there is in effect, as to such services, an election, approved by the agency charged with the administration of the state's unemployment compensation law, pursuant to which all services performed by the individual for such employing unit are deemed to be performed entirely within such state.

2. Potential rights to benefits accumulated under the unemployment compensation laws of one or more states or under one or more such laws of the federal government, or both, may constitute the basis for the payment of benefits through a single appropriate agency upon terms which the department finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests and will not result in any substantial loss to the fund.

3. The department shall participate in any arrangements for the payment of benefits on the basis of combining an individual's wages and employment covered under this chapter with his wages and employment covered under the unemployment compensation laws of other states which are approved by the United States secretary of labor in consultation with the state unemployment compensation agencies as reasonably calculated to assure the prompt and full payment of benefits in such situations and which include provisions for applying the base period of a single state law to a claim involving the combining of an individual's wages and employment covered under two or more state unemployment compensation laws, and avoiding the duplicate use of wages and employment by reason of such combining.

4. Contributions due under this chapter with respect to wages for insured work shall for the purposes of collection of contributions be deemed to have been paid to the fund as of the date payment was made as contributions therefor under another state or federal unemployment compensation law, but no such arrangement shall be entered into unless it contains provisions for reimbursement to the fund of such contributions and the actual earnings thereon as the department finds will be fair and reasonable as to all affected interests.

B. Reimbursements paid from the fund pursuant to paragraph 3 of subsection A of this section shall be deemed benefits for the purpose of sections 23-701 through 23-704 and sections 23-779, 23-780 and 23-782. The department may make to other state or federal agencies and receive from other state or federal agencies, reimbursements from or to the fund in accordance with arrangements entered into pursuant to subsection A of this section.

C. Since the administration of this chapter and of other state and federal unemployment compensation and public employment service laws will be promoted by cooperation between this state and such other states and the appropriate federal agencies in exchanging services, and making available facilities and information, the department may make such investigations, secure and transmit such information, make available such services and facilities and exercise such of the other powers provided in this chapter with respect to the administration of this chapter as it deems necessary or appropriate to facilitate the administration of any such unemployment compensation or public employment service law, and in like manner, may accept and utilize information, services and facilities made available to this state by the agency charged with the administration of any such other unemployment compensation or public employment service law.

D. To the extent permissible under the laws and constitution of the United States, the department may enter into or cooperate in arrangements whereby facilities and services provided under this chapter and facilities and services provided under the unemployment compensation law of a foreign government may be utilized for the taking of claims and the payment of benefits under the employment security law of this state or under a similar law of such government.

Monies in the fund shall be secured by the depository to the same extent and in the same manner as required by the general depository law of the state.

#### Section 23-703. Accounts comprising unemployment compensation fund; deposits; refunds; commingling funds prohibited

A. Within the unemployment compensation fund, there are three separate accounts known as a clearing account, an unemployment trust fund account and a benefit account. All monies payable to the unemployment compensation fund, upon receipt thereof by the department or its agent, shall be immediately deposited in the clearing account. Refunds payable pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be paid from the clearing account or the benefit account upon warrants under the direction of the department. After clearance thereof all other monies in the clearing account shall be immediately deposited with the secretary of the treasury of the United States to the credit of the account of this state in the unemployment trust fund, established and maintained pursuant to section 1104 of the social security act, any provisions of law in this state relating to deposit, administration, release or disbursement of monies in the possession or custody of this state to the contrary notwithstanding.

Upon receipt thereof the treasurer shall deposit the monies in the benefit account and shall pay warrants for payment of benefits and refunds solely from the benefit account. If the department believes more efficient administration will result from such practice, it, in turn, may withdraw from the benefit account amounts it deems necessary for payment of benefits for a reasonable future period and deposit such amounts to the account of the department in a bank or public depository of its choosing and issue checks against it in payment of benefits to claimants entitled thereto under law. The monies shall be secured by the depository to the same extent and in the same manner as required by the general depository law of the state.

(b) Limits the period within which such monies may be obligated to a period ending not more than two years after the date of the enactment of the appropriation law, and

(c) Limits the amount which may be obligated during a fiscal year to an amount which does not exceed the limitations on amount as prescribed by section 903 of the social security act, as amended. For the purposes of this subsection, amounts obligated during any such fiscal year shall be charged against equivalent amounts which were first credited and which are not already so charged, in accordance with the requirements for and limitations on charging prescribed by section 903 of the social security act, as amended.

3. Monies appropriated for the payment of the expenses of administration pursuant to this subsection shall be requisitioned as needed for the payment of obligations incurred under such appropriation and, upon requisition, shall be deposited in the employment security administration fund from which such payments shall be made.

D. The monies in the special administration fund are subject to legislative appropriation and shall be used by the commission for payment of costs of administration found not to have been properly and validly chargeable against federal grants or other funds received for or in the employment security administration fund created by section 23-707.

On the written approval of the election by the department, the services shall be deemed to constitute employment subject to this chapter from and after the date stated in the approval. The services shall cease to be deemed employment subject to this chapter as of January 1 of any calendar year subsequent to the two calendar years, only if within the period from January 1 through March 31 of that year the employing unit has filed with the department a written notice to that effect.

F. Any employing unit that became an employer by reason of section 23-613, subsection A, paragraph 2, subdivision (c) because of services defined as employment under section 23-615, subsection A, paragraph 7, shall cease to be an employer subject to this chapter as of the first day of January of any calendar year if either of the following:

1. The department finds that the employing unit ceased all operations for a period of thirty-five weeks in the preceding calendar year.

2. The employing unit files with the department within the period from January 1 through March 31 of the year a written application for termination of coverage and the department finds that there were not twenty separate days, each day being in a separate calendar week within the preceding calendar year, within which the employing unit employed four or more individuals in employment subject to this chapter.

G. Any employing unit that is an employer solely by reason of section 23-613, subsection B, shall cease to be an employer subject to this chapter as of the first day of January of any calendar year if either of the following are true:

1. The department finds that during the preceding calendar year the employing unit ceased all operations for a period of thirty-five weeks and did not in any calendar quarter in the preceding calendar year pay wages for agricultural labor amounting to at least twenty thousand dollars.

2. The employing unit files with the department within the period from January 1 through March 31 of the year a written application for termination of coverage and the department finds that during the preceding calendar year the employing unit did not have at least ten individuals employed in agricultural labor in twenty separate weeks and did not pay wages for agricultural labor amounting to at least twenty thousand dollars during any calendar quarter in the preceding calendar year.

H. Any employing unit that is an employer solely by reason of section 23-613, subsection C, shall cease to be an employer subject to this chapter as of January 1 of any calendar year if the employing unit files with the department within the period from January 1 through March 31 of that year a written application for termination of coverage and the department finds that the employing unit did not pay wages for domestic service in a private home, local college club, or local chapter of a college fraternity or sorority amounting to at least one thousand dollars during any calendar quarter in the preceding calendar year.

I. The time limitation for filing of written application for termination of coverage prescribed in subsections B, F, G and H of this section may be waived by the department if the time limitation has expired prior to the date on which a determination of liability that the employing unit is subject to this chapter has been made as provided in section 23-724.

 

#### Section 23-726. Contributions; voluntary payment

A. Contributions shall accrue and become payable by each employer for each calendar year in which the employer is subject to this chapter with respect to wages for employment. The contributions shall become due and be paid by each employer to the commission for the fund in accordance with such regulations as the commission prescribes, and shall not be deducted, in whole or in part, from the wages of individuals in the employer's employ.

B. In the payment of contributions, a fractional part of a cent shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half cent or more in which case it shall be increased to one cent.  From and after December 31, 2004, the payment of contributions or job training employer taxes is not required if the quarterly amount of the contributions and taxes is less than ten dollars.

C. An employer may make voluntary payments in addition to the contributions required under this chapter that shall be credited to the employer's account in accordance with commission regulation. The voluntary payments shall be included in the employer's account as of the employer's most recent computation date if they are made on or before the following February 28. Voluntary payments when accepted from an employer will not be refunded in whole or in part.

D. The payment of contributions is not required if the quarterly amount of the contribution or taxes is less than ten dollars.

 

#### Section 23-727. Credits and charges to employer accounts

A. The commission shall maintain a separate account for each employer and shall credit the account with all contributions and payments in lieu of contributions paid by the employer and shall charge the account with all benefits chargeable to it.

B. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any employer or individuals in its service prior claims or rights to the amounts paid by the employer into the fund.

C. Except as otherwise provided in subsections D, E, F, G, I and J of this section and sections 23-773 and 23-777, benefits paid to an individual shall be charged against the accounts of the individual's base-period employers. The amount of benefits so chargeable against each base-period employer's account shall bear the same ratio to the total benefits paid to an individual as the base-period wages paid to the individual by the employer bear to the total amount of base-period wages paid to the individual by all the individual's base-period employers.

D. Benefits paid to an individual whose separation from work with any employer occurs under conditions found by the commission to be within those prescribed by section 23-775, paragraph 1 or 2 or for compelling personal reasons not attributable to the employer and not warranting disqualification for benefits shall not be used as a factor in determining the future contribution rate of the employer from whose employment the individual so separated, but the employer shall establish the condition of such separation to the satisfaction of the commission by submitting information the commission requires within ten days after the date of notification or mailing of notice by the commission that the individual has first filed a claim for benefits.

E. Benefits paid to an individual who, during the individual's base period, earned wages for part-time employment with an employer shall not be used as a factor in determining the future contribution rate of that employer if the employer continues to give employment opportunities to the individual to the same extent while the individual is receiving benefits as during the base period and the employer submits information the commission may require within ten working days after the date of notification or mailing of notice by the commission that the individual has first filed a claim for benefits.  The commission has the burden of proof to establish that the employer failed to give employment opportunities to the individual to the same extent as during the base period.

F. Benefits paid to an individual whose employment was terminated by retirement pursuant to a nongovernmental retirement or lump sum retirement pay plan under which the age of mandatory retirement has been agreed on between the employer and its employees or by the bargaining agent representing such employees shall not be used as a factor in determining the future contribution rate of that employer but the employer shall establish that fact by submitting information the commission may require within ten days after the date of notification or mailing of notice by the commission that the individual has first filed a claim for benefits.

G. Benefits paid pursuant to section 23-771, subsections B and D shall not be used as a factor in determining the future contribution rate of the affected base-period employers.

H. A determination that benefits paid shall be used in determining future contribution rates of the employer may be appealed by the employer in the same manner provided for appeals of benefit determinations.

I. Benefits paid to an individual whose employment was terminated because the individual's employer was called to active duty in the military shall not be used as a factor in determining the future contribution rate of the employer from whose employment the individual was terminated.

J. Benefits paid to an individual whose employment was terminated because a former employee of the employer returned to work for the employer after being called to active duty in the military shall not be used as a factor in determining the future contribution rate of the employer from whose employment the individual was terminated.

K. The commission shall not relieve an employer's account of charges relating to an erroneous benefit payment if the commission determines both of the following:

1. The erroneous benefit payment was made because the employer or an agent of the employer failed to timely or adequately respond to a written request from the commission for information relating to a claim for unemployment compensation.

2. The employer or the employer's agent has established a pattern of failing to timely or adequately respond to requests.

L. For the purposes of subsection K of this section:

1. "Erroneous benefit payment" means a payment that would not have been made but for the failure of the employer or the employer's agent to make a timely or adequate response as described in subsection K, paragraph 1 of this section in regard to the claim for unemployment compensation.

2. "Pattern of failing" means the repeated documented failure of an employer or employer's agent to make timely and adequate responses as described in subsection K, paragraph 1 of this section with consideration of the number of instances of failure in relation to the total number of requests. Pattern of failing shall be determined by reviewing the most immediate twelve month prior period.  A pattern shall be established if the employer or the agent representing the employer has five or more failures or failures in more than five per cent of the number of requests, whichever is greater.  When an agent is representing the employer, the five or more failures or failures in more than five per cent of the number of requests shall be specific to the individual employer's account.

 

#### Section 23-728. Standard rate of contribution

The standard rate of contributions payable by each employer for calendar year 1985 and each year thereafter shall be five and four-tenths per cent of the wages paid by the employer during each calendar year.

#### Section 23-729. Change from the standard contribution rate

If an employer's account has been chargeable with benefits throughout the twelve consecutive calendar month period ending on June 30 of the preceding calendar year, the employer shall have a rate computed in accordance with section 23-730. If the employer's account has not been chargeable with benefits for that twelve month period, the employer shall pay contributions at the reduced rate of two per cent.

#### Section 23-730. Variation and adjustment of contribution rates

For calendar year 1985 and each calendar year thereafter, variations from the standard rate of contribution shall be determined in accordance with the following requirements:

1. If the total of all an employer's contributions, paid on or before July 31 of the preceding calendar year with respect to wages paid by the employer prior to July 1 of the preceding calendar year, equals or exceeds the total benefits that were chargeable to the employer's account and were paid prior to July 1 of the preceding calendar year, with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning prior to July 1, the employer's contribution rate for the ensuing calendar year subject to the adjustments provided by this section shall be determined from the employer's positive reserve ratio in accordance with the table provided in this paragraph. An employer's positive reserve ratio is the percentage resulting from dividing the employer's reserve surplus, which is the excess of contributions paid over benefits charged by the employer's average annual taxable payroll.  If an employer's reserve equals zero, the employer's contribution rate for the ensuing calendar year shall be two and seven-tenths per cent, subject to the adjustments provided by this section.

Positive Reserve Ratio   Contribution Rate

Less than 3%                                          2.60%

At least 3% but less than 4%                          2.40%

At least 4% but less than 5%                          2.15%

At least 5% but less than 6%                          1.90%

At least 6% but less than 7%                          1.65%

At least 7% but less than 8%                          1.40%

At least 8% but less than 9%                          1.15%

At least 9% but less than 10%                         0.90%

At least 10% but less than 11%                        0.65%

At least 11% but less than 12%                        0.40%

At least 12% but less than 13%                        0.15%

13% or more                                           0.02%

2. If the total of all an employer's contributions, paid on or before July 31 of the preceding calendar year with respect to wages paid by the employer prior to July 1 of the preceding calendar year, is less than the total benefits that were chargeable to the employer's account and were paid prior to July 1 of the preceding calendar year, with respect to weeks of unemployment beginning prior to July 1, the employer's contribution rate for the ensuing calendar year shall be determined from the employer's negative reserve ratio in accordance with the table provided in this paragraph, subject to the rate adjustment provided in paragraph 3, except that the rate is subject to increases but not to reduction.  An employer's negative reserve ratio is the percentage resulting from dividing the employer's reserve deficit, which is the excess of benefits charged over contributions paid, by the employer's average annual taxable payroll. The table applicable to rate computation for calendar year 1987 and each calendar year thereafter is:

Negative Reserve Ratio Contribution Rate

Less than 3%                                          2.85%

At least 3% but less than 4%                          3.05%

At least 4% but less than 5%                          3.30%

At least 5% but less than 6%                          3.55%

At least 6% but less than 7%                          3.80%

At least 7% but less than 8%                          4.05%

At least 8% but less than 9%                          4.30%

At least 9% but less than 10%                         4.55%

At least 10% but less than 11%                        4.80%

At least 11% but less than 12%                        5.05%

At least 12% but less than 13%                        5.30%

13% or more                                           5.40%

3. The ratio of the total assets of the fund on July 31 as defined by department regulation to the total taxable payrolls for the twelve month period immediately preceding the computation date shall determine the required income rate for the ensuing calendar year in accordance with the following fund control schedule:

Fund Ratio Required Income Rate

12.0% or more                                         0.40%

At least 10.0% but less than 12.0%                    0.50%

At least 9.5% but less than l0.0%                     0.60%

At least 9.0% but less than 9.5%                      0.70%

At least 8.5% but less than 9.0%                      0.80%

At least 8.0% but less than 8.5%                      0.90%

At least 7.5% but less than 8.0%                      1.00%

At least 7.0% but less than 7.5%                      1.10%

At least 6.5% but less than 7.0%                      1.20%

At least 6.0% but less than 6.5%                      1.30%

At least 5.5% but less than 6.0%                      1.40%

At least 5.0% but less than 5.5%                      1.50%

At least 4.5% but less than 5.0%                      1.70%

At least 4.0% but less than 4.5%                      1.80%

At least 3.5% but less than 4.0%                      2.00%

At least 3.0% but less than 3.5%                      2.20%

Less than 3.0%                                        2.40%

For each calendar year the department shall compute the estimated required tax yield from employers that is the product of the total taxable payrolls for the twelve month period immediately preceding the computation date and the applicable required income rate from the fund control schedule less the interest earned on monies in the fund during the twelve month period immediately preceding the computation date and credited to the fund by the United States treasury on or before October 31 following the computation date. Except as otherwise provided by statute, the rates in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be adjusted proportionately if the estimated required tax yield from employers exceeds or is less than the estimated yield from the rates without adjustment.

4. In computing an employer's adjusted rate as provided by paragraph 3, the adjusted rate shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth per cent.  An employer's adjusted rate shall not be less than two one hundredths per cent.

 

#### Section 23-731. Classification of employers by benefit experience to determine contribution rates; rate when report unavailable

The commission, for each calendar year, shall classify employers in accordance with their actual experience in the payment of contributions and with respect to benefits charged against their accounts, with a view to fixing such contribution rates as will reflect the benefit experience.  Each employer's rate for a calendar year shall be determined on the basis of the employer's record as of July 1 of the preceding calendar year. If as of the date the classification of employers is made the commission finds an employing unit has failed to file any report required in connection therewith or has filed a report which the commission finds incorrect or insufficient, the commission shall make an estimate of the information required from the employing unit on the basis of the best evidence reasonably available to it at the time and shall notify the employing unit by mail addressed to its last known address.  Unless the employing unit files the report or a corrected or sufficient report as the case may be within fifteen days after mailing the notice, the commission shall compute such employing unit's rate of contributions on the basis of such estimates, and the rate as so determined shall be subject to increase but not to reduction on the basis of subsequently ascertained information.

 

#### Section 23-732. Annual notice to employer of contribution rate; procedure for review and redetermination; quarterly notification; notification by electronic means

A. The department shall promptly notify each employer of the employer's rate of contributions as determined for any calendar year. The determination shall become conclusive and binding on the employer unless, within fifteen days after the mailing of notice of the determination to the employer's last known address or in the absence of mailing, within fifteen days after delivery of the notice, the employer files an application for review and redetermination, setting forth the employer's reasons for application for review and redetermination.  The department shall reconsider the rate, but no employer shall in any proceeding involving the employer's rate of contributions or contribution liability contest the chargeability to the employer's account of any benefits paid in accordance with a determination, redetermination or decision pursuant to section 23-773, and determined to be chargeable to the employer's account pursuant to section 23-727, except on the ground that the services on the basis of which the benefits were found to be chargeable did not constitute services performed in employment for the employer and only in the event that the employer was not a party to the determination, redetermination or decision or to any other proceedings under this chapter in which the character of the services was determined.  The employer shall be promptly notified of the department's denial of the employer's application, or of the department's redetermination, both of which shall become final unless within fifteen days after mailing or delivery of notification an appeal is filed with the appeals board.

B. The department may give quarterly notification to employers of benefits paid and chargeable to their accounts or of the status of such accounts, and such notification, in the absence of an application for redetermination filed within fifteen days after mailing, shall become conclusive and binding on the employer for all purposes. A redetermination or denial of an application by the department shall become final unless within fifteen days after mailing or delivery of the redetermination or denial an appeal is filed with the appeals board. The redeterminations may be introduced in any subsequent administrative or judicial proceedings involving the determination of the rate of contributions of any employer for any calendar year.

C. A notice under this section may be delivered by electronic means if the party being notified consents in writing to notification by electronic means.  Notification by electronic means is deemed complete on transmission.

 

#### Section 23-733. Transfer of employer experience rating accounts to successor employer; liability of successor

A. When any employing unit in any manner succeeds to or acquires the organization, trade or business, or substantially all of the assets thereof, excepting any assets retained by such employer incident to the liquidation of his obligations, whether or not such acquiring employing unit was an employer within the meaning of section 23-613, prior to such acquisition, and continues such organization, trade or business, the account of the predecessor employer shall be transferred as of the date of acquisition to the successor employer for the purpose of rate determination.

B. An employing unit which succeeds to or acquires a distinct and severable portion of an organization, trade or business may apply for transfer of the account of the portion by filing with the department not later than one hundred eighty days after the date of acquisition a written application for transfer, approved in writing by the predecessor, except that for good cause shown the department may extend the time for filing the application. The account of the acquired portion shall be transferred to the successor as of the date of acquisition only if the successor continues to operate the acquired portion and submits necessary information establishing the separate identity of the account within thirty days after the request for the necessary supporting payroll information is mailed to the successor by the department, except that for good cause shown the department may extend the time for submitting such supporting information.  The predecessor and successor employers shall be promptly notified of the determination made upon the application which shall become final fifteen days after written notice thereof is served personally or by certified mail addressed to the last known address of each employing unit involved, unless within such time one of the parties files with the department a written request for reconsideration. When timely request for reconsideration is filed, a reconsidered determination shall be made. The reconsidered determination shall become final fifteen days after written notice thereof is served personally or by certified mail addressed to the last known address of each employing unit involved, unless within such time one of the employing units involved files with the department a written petition for hearing. When timely petition for hearing is filed, the parties shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing and thereafter furnished with a decision. The decision shall become final unless a petition for review is filed as provided in section 23-672.

C. If the successor employer was an employer subject to this chapter prior to the date of acquisition of an organization, trade or business, or substantially all of the assets thereof, his rate of contributions for the remainder of the calendar year in which the acquisition occurred shall be his rate as previously assigned for the calendar year in which the acquisition occurred. If the successor was not an employer prior to the date of acquisition, his rate for the remainder of the calendar year beginning on the date of acquisition shall be the rate applicable to the predecessor employer or employers for the calendar year in which the acquisition occurred, if there was only one predecessor or there were only predecessors with identical rates. If the predecessor rates were not identical, the successor's rate for the remainder of the calendar year beginning on the date of acquisition shall be recomputed on the basis of the combined accounts of the predecessors as of the computation date applicable to the calendar year in which the acquisition occurred. When the account for a distinct and severable portion has been transferred to a successor who was not an employer prior to the date of acquisition, the rate of the successor for the remainder of the calendar year beginning on the date of acquisition shall be computed as of the computation date applicable to such calendar year, on the basis of the experience attributable to the acquired portion. If the successor was an employer prior to the date of acquisition, his rate for the remainder of the calendar year beginning on the date of acquisition shall be the rate previously assigned to him for the calendar year in which the acquisition occurred. The rate of the predecessor for the remainder of the calendar year beginning on the date of acquisition shall be the rate previously assigned to him with respect to the calendar year in which the acquisition occurred.

D. Any individual or organization, including the types of organizations described in section 23-614, whether or not an employing unit, which in any manner acquires the organization, trade or business, or substantially all of the assets thereof, shall be liable, in an amount not to exceed the reasonable value, as determined by the department, of the organization, trade, business or assets acquired, for any contributions, interest and penalties due or accrued and unpaid by such predecessor employer, except that the department may waive the successor's liability for such unpaid amounts if a determination that the predecessor was subject to this chapter had not been made as provided in section 23-724 prior to the date of acquisition, and such liability on the part of the successor would be against equity and good conscience.

E. The amount of liability of a successor employer for any contribution, interest and penalties due or accrued and unpaid by his predecessor employer shall be a lien against the property or assets so acquired which shall be prior to all other liens except prior recorded realty mortgages, but the lien shall not be valid as against one who acquires from the successor any interest in the property or assets in good faith, for value, and without notice of the lien. On written request, the department shall furnish the successor with a written statement of the amount of contributions, interest and penalties due or accrued and unpaid by the predecessor employer as of the date of such acquisition, and the amount of the liability of the successor or the amount of the lien shall in no event exceed the liability disclosed in such statement. The remedy provided by this section shall be in addition to all other existing remedies against the predecessor employer or his successor, and the lien against the successor may be foreclosed as in other civil actions.

#### Section 23-733.01. Assignments of rates; transfers of experience; violation; civil penalty; definitions

A. If an employer transfers the employer's trade or business or a portion of the trade or business to another employer and at the time of the transfer there is substantially common ownership, management or control between the two employers, the unemployment experience that is attributable to the initial employer shall be transferred to the successor employer.  The rate of both employers shall be recalculated and made effective to the beginning of the calendar year that follows the date of the transfer of trade or business.

B. If a person is not an employer that is subject to this chapter when the employer acquires a trade or business of an employing unit, the unemployment experience of the acquired business shall not be transferred to the successor employer if the department determines that the successor employer acquired the trade or business for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contributions.  Instead, the department shall assign the standard contribution rate under section 23-729 to the successor employer.  When making a determination under this section, the department shall consider the cost of acquiring the business, whether the person continues the business enterprise of the acquired business, the length of time that the enterprise is continued and whether a substantial number of new employees were hired to perform duties that were unrelated to the business activity before the acquisition.

C. If an employer or a person knowingly violates or attempts to violate this section for the purpose of obtaining a lower rate of contribution or if a person knowingly advises an employer or a person on evading or defeating a contribution or its payment, the person or employer shall be subject to the following penalties:

1. If the person is an employer, the person shall be assigned the highest rate assignable under this chapter for the rate year in which the transfer or the attempted transfer occurred and for the following three rate years.  If the person's business is already at the highest rate for any year, or if the amount of increase in rate would be less than two per cent for any year, the contribution penalty rate of two per cent of taxable wages shall be imposed for any such year.

2. If the person is not an employer, the department shall assess against the person a civil penalty of five thousand dollars.  The department shall deposit penalties collected pursuant to this paragraph in the penalty and interest account pursuant to section 23-705.

3. Any person or employer in violation of this section may also be prosecuted pursuant to section 13-2310 or 13-2311. This does not preclude prosecution pursuant to section 23-786.

D. Notwithstanding any other law, this section applies to the assignments of rates and transfers of experience under this chapter.

E. This department shall apply this section in order to meet the minimum requirements of any guidance or regulation that is issued by the United States department of labor.

F. The department shall adopt rules to identify the transfer or acquisition of a business under this section.

G. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Knowingly" means having actual knowledge of or acting with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of a requirement.

2. "Person" means person as defined in section 7701(a)(1) of the internal revenue code.

3. "Trade or business" includes an employer's workforce.

4. "Violates or attempts to violate" includes an action to evade, conceal, misrepresent or engage in wilful nondisclosure.

 

#### Section 23-734. Agreement by employee to pay employer contribution void

No agreement by an individual in the employ of any person or concern to pay all or a portion of an employer's contributions or payments in lieu of contributions required under this chapter from the employer shall be valid.

#### Section 23-735. Requiring or accepting payments from wages to finance employer's contribution; waiver of rights of employee; violation; classification

A. No employer shall directly or indirectly make, require or accept a deduction from wages to finance the employer's contributions or payments in lieu of contributions required from him, or require or accept a waiver of any right under this chapter by any individual in his employ.

B. An employer or officer or agent of an employer who violates any provision of this section is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor.

#### Section 23-736. Interest on past due contributions; deposit of interest

A. If contributions are not paid on the date due and payable as prescribed by the commission, the whole or part thereafter remaining unpaid shall bear interest at the rate of one per cent per month, or fraction thereof, from and after the due date until payment is received by the commission, subject to waiver for good cause shown. The date as of which payment of contributions, if mailed, is deemed to have been received may be determined by such regulations as the commission may prescribe.

B. Interest collected pursuant to this section and section 23-723 shall be deposited in the special administration fund.

#### Section 23-737. Collection of contributions or interest; precedence of action

A. If a contribution, payment in lieu of a contribution, penalty or interest imposed under this chapter is not paid when due, these amounts may be collected by levy pursuant to section 23-752 or by civil action in the name of the department, and the employer adjudged in default shall pay the court costs.

B. Actions brought under this section shall be heard by the court at the earliest possible date and shall have precedence over other civil actions, except petitions for judicial review under this chapter, and cases arising under chapter 6 of this title.

C. After judgment is entered pursuant to this article against the state, a city, town, county, school district or other political subdivision or an instrumentality, agency, board or commission thereof, or any combination of the foregoing, the department shall notify the employer that judgment has been entered. Within thirty days of the date of notice the treasurer or other appropriate officer of the employer charged with the receipt, custody, and disbursements of its monies or funds shall, without issuance of execution or garnishment or other legal action, remit to the department all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, interest and penalties in judgment. If within the thirty-day period satisfaction of judgment is not obtained, the department shall petition for and the superior court may grant an order compelling payment of the amounts in judgment by the governing body of the employer against which judgment has been entered.

#### Section 23-737.01. Collection of amounts due by certificate for judgment

A. If a contribution or payment in lieu of a contribution imposed under this chapter is not paid when due, the department may, instead of pursuing civil action authorized in section 23-737, obtain judgment against the employer as prescribed by this section.

B. No earlier than fifteen days after the date on which contributions or payments in lieu of contributions are due, the department shall issue a determination stating the amounts of contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, penalties and interest due. Unless the employer files a written petition for hearing within fifteen days after the determination is served personally or sent by certified mail to the last known address of the employer, the determination becomes final. The determination shall state that a certificate for judgment will be filed unless, within the fifteen days, the employer files with the department a written petition for hearing stating the reasons why the amount of the indebtedness is considered to be incorrect.

C. If a timely petition for hearing is filed as prescribed in subsection B of this section, the employer shall be afforded an opportunity for hearing on the issue of the amount of indebtedness and thereafter furnished with a decision. The hearing shall be conducted by the department and a decision issued by the hearing officer. The decision becomes final unless within the time and in the manner provided in title 12, chapter 7, article 6 a petition for judicial review and a bond approved by the court in the amount of the total indebtedness as determined by the decision is filed with the superior court by the employer.

D. Notwithstanding section 22-201 with regard to jurisdiction, after a decision under this section and any decision on the issue of liability arising under section 23-724 affecting the amounts due have become final, the department may file with the clerk of the superior court in any county a certificate for judgment, without regard to the amount involved. The certificate shall:

### Article 5.1 - Shared Work Unemployment Compensation

#### Section 23-761. Definitions

In this article, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Affected group" means two or more employees designated by the employer to participate in a shared work plan.

2. "Approved shared work plan" or "approved plan" means an employer's shared work plan which meets the requirements of section 23-762 and which the department approves in writing.

3. "Normal weekly hours of work" means the number of hours in a week that the employee normally would work for the shared work employer or forty hours, whichever is less.

4. "Shared work benefits" means benefits, including benefits payable to federal civilian employees and to ex-servicemen pursuant to 5 United States Code, chapter 85, payable to an individual under this article for weeks of reduced work under an approved shared work plan.

5. "Shared work employer" means an employer with a shared work plan in effect. An individual who or an employing unit which succeeds to or acquires, pursuant to section 23-733, an organization, trade or business with a shared work plan in effect automatically becomes a shared work employer and adopts such plan, if such individual or employing unit certifies to shared work benefits under the previously approved plan.

6. "Shared work plan" or "plan" means an employer's voluntary written plan for reducing unemployment under which a specified group of employees shares the work remaining after their normal weekly hours of work are reduced.

#### Section 23-762. Requirements of shared work plan; approval

A. An employer wishing to participate in the shared work unemployment compensation program shall submit a signed, written shared work plan to the department for approval. The department shall approve a shared work plan only if the plan:

1. Specifies the employees in the affected group.

2. Applies to only one affected group.

3. If feasible, includes a description of the employer's plan for notifying an employee whose work week is to be reduced.

4. Includes a certified statement by the employer that, for the six-month period immediately preceding the date the plan is submitted, compensation was payable from the shared work employer, or its predecessors whether or not they were shared work employers, to each employee in the affected group in an amount equal to or greater than the wages for insured work in one calendar quarter as provided in section 23-771, subsection A, paragraph 6. An employee who joins an affected group after the approval of the shared work plan is automatically covered under the previously approved plan, effective the week that the department receives written notice from the shared work employer that the employee has joined and certification from the employer that the employee meets the provisions of section 23-771, subsection A, paragraph 6.

5. Includes a certified statement by the employer that for the duration of the plan the reduction in the total normal weekly hours of work of the employees in the affected group is instead of layoffs which otherwise would result in at least as large a reduction in the total normal weekly hours of work. The employer shall include an estimate of the number of layoffs that would have occurred without an approved shared work plan.

6. Specifies the manner in which the employer will treat fringe benefits of the employees in the affected group if the employees' hours are reduced to less than their normal weekly hours of work. The employer must certify, if the employer provides health benefits and retirement benefits under a defined benefit plan to any employee whose workweek is reduced under the plan, that these benefits will continue to be provided to an employee participating in the shared work plan under the same terms and conditions as though the workweek of the employee had not been reduced or to the same extent as other employees not participating in the shared work program.

7. Specifies an expiration date that is no more than one year from the date the employer submits the plan for approval, except that on written request by the employer, the department may approve an extension of the plan for a period of not more than one year from the date of the request.

8. Is approved in writing by the collective bargaining agent for each collective bargaining agreement that covers any employee in the affected group.

B. The plan prescribed in subsection A of this section and the implementation of the plan must be consistent with the employer's obligations under all other federal and state laws.

1. The individual is employed as a member of an affected group in an approved plan that was approved before the week and is in effect for the week.

2. The individual's normal weekly hours of work were reduced at least ten per cent but not more than forty per cent.

3. The individual met the requirements of section 23-771, subsection A, paragraphs 3 and 4.

C. The department shall not pay an individual shared work benefits for more than twenty-six weeks in a benefit year, except that this limitation does not apply to a week if for the period consisting of the week and the immediately preceding twelve weeks the rate, not seasonally adjusted, of insured unemployment in this state is equal to or greater than four per cent.

D. The total amount of regular benefits and shared work benefits that the department pays to an individual for weeks in the individual's benefit year shall not exceed the total for the benefit year as provided in section 23-780.

E.

#### Section 23-764. Amount of benefits

The department shall pay an individual eligible for shared work benefits with respect to any week a shared work benefit that is a proportionate amount as provided in this section of the employee's weekly benefit amount as provided in section 23-780. The department shall pay a shared work weekly benefit that is an amount directly proportionate to the ratio of the number of normal weekly hours of work for which the employer would not compensate the employee to the employee's normal weekly hours of work unless the employer compensates the employee on a piecework basis, in which case the department shall pay an amount directly proportionate to the ratio of the normal number of weekly pieces worked for which the employer would not compensate the employee to the employee's normal number of weekly pieces worked. If the amount is not an even multiple of one dollar, the department shall round it to the nearest dollar, and the department shall round an even one-half dollar to the next higher multiple of one dollar. Except as provided in section 23-791, the department shall not reduce the amount for compensation payable for the week. The provisions of section 23-789 which require the department to deduct and withhold certain amounts payable to an individual who is liable for child support obligations apply to this article.

#### Section 23-766. Other provisions of this chapter; department regulations; applicability

Except as otherwise provided by or inconsistent with this article, this chapter and department regulations apply to benefits under this article.

(b) For a benefit year beginning on or after September 2, 1984, has been paid wages for insured work during at least two quarters of the individual's base period and the amount of the wages paid in one quarter would be sufficient to qualify the individual for the maximum weekly benefit amount payable under this chapter and the total of the individual's base-period wages is equal to or greater than the taxable limit as specified in section 23-622, subsection B, paragraphs 1 and 2.

7. Following the beginning date of a benefit year established under this chapter or the unemployment compensation law of any other state and before the effective date of a subsequent benefit year under this chapter, has performed services whether or not in employment as defined in section 23-615 for which wages were payable in an amount equal to or in excess of eight times the weekly benefit amount for which the individual is otherwise qualified under section 23-779. In making a determination under this paragraph, the department shall use information available in its records or require the individual to furnish necessary information within thirty days after the date notice is given that the information is required.

Wages previously used to establish a benefit year may not be reused. This subsection does not apply unless all of the following occur:

D. The department shall not disqualify an individual from receiving benefits under this chapter on the basis of the individual's separation from employment if the individual is a victim of domestic violence and leaves employment due to a documented case involving domestic violence pursuant to section 13-3601 or 13-3601.02.  Benefits paid to an individual pursuant to this subsection shall not be charged against an employer's account pursuant to section 23-727, subsection G.

E. The department shall not disqualify an individual from receiving benefits under this chapter on the basis of the individual's separation from employment if the individual was terminated from employment for not receiving a COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 booster shot required by the employer.  Benefits paid to an individual pursuant to this subsection shall not be charged against an employer's account pursuant to section 23-727 if the employer's requirement that employees receive the COVID-19 vaccine or COVID-19 booster shot is required by law.

#### Section 23-771.01. Approved training; definitions

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no otherwise eligible individual shall be denied benefits for any week:

1. Because he is in training approved by the secretary of labor under section 236 of the trade act of 1974, as amended, or because of leaving work which is not suitable employment to enter such training.

2. Because he is in training with the approval of the department, nor

3. Because of the application to any such week of such training of any provision of this chapter relating to availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to apply for or accept work.

B.

If the training allowance is less than the benefits to which the individual would otherwise be entitled, his benefits shall be computed in accordance with section 23-779, subsection C, treating the training allowance in the same manner as wages, and benefits shall be paid accordingly.

C. In this section, unless the context otherwise requires, "suitable employment" means, with respect to an individual, work which is of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the individual's past adversely affected employment and for which the wages equal or exceed eighty per cent of the individual's average weekly wage.

A. The department shall establish a training program to provide a structured, supervised training opportunity to individuals through employers that volunteer to participate in the program.

#### Section 23-772. Claims for benefits; initial claim filing notice to employer; contents of notice; continued claim notice to employer; posting printed statements dealing with claims

D. Each employer shall post and maintain printed statements dealing with claims for benefits in places readily accessible to individuals in the employer's service, and shall make available to each individual at the time the individual becomes unemployed a printed statement dealing with claims for benefits. Printed statements shall be supplied by the department to each employer without cost.

 

#### Section 23-773. Examination and determination of claims

A. A representative designated by the department as a deputy shall promptly examine any claim for benefits and, on the basis of the facts found by the deputy, shall determine whether or not the claim is valid. If the claim is valid, the deputy shall also determine the week with respect to which the benefit year shall commence, the weekly benefit amount payable and the maximum duration of the benefit.

B. The deputy shall promptly notify the claimant and any other interested parties of the determination and the reasons for the determination.  Except as provided in subsection D of this section, unless the claimant or an interested party, within seven calendar days after the delivery of notification, or within fifteen calendar days after notification was mailed to the claimant's or interested party's last known address, files an appeal from the determination, it shall become final, and benefits shall be paid or denied in accordance with the determination.  The department shall adopt rules to allow an appeal to be filed in writing, electronically or by telephone. If an appeal tribunal affirms a determination of the deputy allowing benefits, or the appeals board affirms a determination or decision allowing benefits, the benefits shall be paid regardless of any appeal that may thereafter be taken, but if that decision is finally reversed, no employer's account shall be charged with benefits so paid.

C. On receipt of a request from an interested party for information about a deputy's determination made pursuant to this section or section 23-673, the department shall make available by memorandum or other written document within five days after receipt of the request the following information:

1. The facts considered and the facts relied on in making the determination.

2. The specific statutes, regulations or other authority relied on in making the determination.

3. The reasoning applied in making the determination.

D. Before the time for appeal as prescribed in subsection B of this section has expired, an interested party may request a reconsidered determination.  The department shall examine the request and, within seven calendar days, deny the request or issue a reconsidered determination.  The interested party may prove that a response was timely filed by using evidence of fax records that documents the date and time when a faxed response was transmitted and received by the department.  A request for reconsideration that is denied shall be treated as an appeal, and the same procedure shall be followed as provided for in case of appeal from the original determination. If a reconsidered determination is issued, the time for appeal shall run from the date of issuance of the reconsidered determination. The employer and the claimant shall each be permitted no more than one request for reconsideration on each case.

E. Before the actual filing of an appeal under subsection B of this section, but not later than the time permitted to appeal, the department on its own motion may issue a reconsidered determination. After the time for appeal has expired, but within one year after the issuance of the original determination, the department with authorization of the unemployment insurance program administrator may issue a reconsidered determination, on the basis of newly discovered evidence that by due diligence could not have been previously discovered, if no administrative or judicial review has occurred or is pending on the original determination. If a redetermination is based on fraud, the one year limitation on the issuance of redeterminations does not apply.

F. Prompt notice in writing of any reconsidered determination under subsection E of this section and the reasons for reconsideration shall be given to all interested parties. An interested party may appeal within the time prescribed under subsection B of this section, and the same procedure shall be followed as provided for in case of an appeal from the original determination.

 

#### Section 23-774. Documentation of benefit eligibility

A. The department shall require an individual who files a claim for benefits to provide documentation or information sufficient for the department to determine the individual's eligibility for benefits.  If an individual who files a claim for benefits has the ability to produce documents or information and fails to produce the documents or information, the department may find the individual's claim for unemployment benefits invalid until the documents or information are produced.

B. On request by the department, an employer shall provide relevant documentation to the department to allow the department to determine the individual's eligibility for benefits.

C. If an employer provides documentation that an individual either voluntarily resigned from employment or abandoned the individual's employment, the burden of providing documentation to determine an individual's eligibility for benefits shifts to the individual.

D. Documentation from an employer to show the individual's voluntary resignation or abandonment of employment may include written or verbal statements from the employer detailing the individual's circumstances for leaving employment.  Supporting documentation of:

1. A voluntary resignation may include an employer's attestation of the individual's verbal resignation and that work was available for the individual, if the individual did not provide a written resignation.

2. Job abandonment may include an attestation from the employer that the individual failed to report for assigned work and that work was available for the individual.

E. Notwithstanding this section, the department shall make reasonable efforts to obtain the information necessary to determine the eligibility of the individual.

 

#### Section 23-775. Disqualification from benefits

An individual shall be disqualified for benefits:

1. For the week in which the individual has left work voluntarily without good cause in connection with the employment, and in addition to the waiting week, for the duration of the individual's unemployment and until the individual has earned wages in an amount equivalent to five times the individual's weekly benefit amount otherwise payable. If a person leaves because of transportation difficulties, the individual shall be disqualified unless the individual can show the individual's travel requirements are in excess of the normal practice in the individual's occupation and past practice or that the individual has compelling personal circumstances requiring the individual's leaving.  Compelling personal circumstances shall include but are not limited to a showing of any of the following:

(a) Over thirty miles distance from the individual's home to work.

(b) More than one and one-half hours to reach work.

(c) A spouse or unemancipated minor leaving work to accompany the other spouse or a parent who is a member of the armed services and who is transferred to another locality as a result of official orders.

2. For the week in which the individual has been discharged for wilful or negligent misconduct connected with the employment, and in addition to the waiting week, for the duration of the individual's unemployment and until the individual has earned wages in an amount equivalent to five times the individual's weekly benefit amount otherwise payable.

3. For any week with respect to which or a part of which the individual has received or is seeking unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state or of the United States, but if the appropriate agency of the other state or of the United States finally determines that the individual is not entitled to unemployment benefits, the ineligibility shall not apply.

4. For the week in which the individual becomes unemployed and for not more than the following three weeks, if the individual's unemployment is due solely to a customary suspension of all operations, except maintenance work, at the factory, plant or other premises at which the individual was last employed, which will not occur more than once in a calendar year and will not exceed four consecutive weeks' duration, and the employment will again be available to the individual on resumption of operations. For the purposes of this paragraph:

(a) "Customary suspension" means a suspension that has occurred for the same or similar reasons in each of three consecutive years or more, including the year in question, regardless of whether the suspension in any previous year would have satisfied the requirements of this paragraph. A suspension provided for by an agreement to which the employer is a party shall be considered customary unless the agreement specifies the exact time, duration, type and circumstances of the suspension. Any suspension whose details are determined by the employer shall be considered customary, regardless of the employer's ultimate reason for imposing it, as long as the employer's reason or reasons are the same or similar over the necessary period.

(b) "Factory, plant or other premises" means any location or premises or portion of locations or premises of the employer where the work or operations are separate and distinct from those at other locations or premises or portions of locations or premises, regardless of geographic proximity or functional, geographic or administrative integration of the work or operations.

(c) "Maintenance work" has its usual meaning and includes any administrative, executive, clerical or supervisory work or any other work necessary to keep the factory, plant or other premises in a position to resume full operations promptly at the end of the suspension or necessary to pay, supervise or otherwise support individuals performing such work.

5. For any week in which the individual is incarcerated.

 

#### Section 23-776. Disqualification from benefits for failure to accept suitable work or actively seek work; exceptions

A. An individual shall be disqualified for benefits if the department finds the individual has failed without cause either to apply for available, suitable work, when so directed by the employment office or the department, to actively engage in seeking work, to accept suitable work when offered or to return to the individual's customary self-employment when so directed by the department. The disqualification shall begin with the week in which the failure occurred and shall continue for the duration of the individual's unemployment and until the individual has earned wages in an amount equivalent to eight times the individual's weekly benefit amount otherwise payable.

B. In determining whether or not work is suitable for an individual:

1. During the first four weeks of a benefit period, the department shall consider the degree of risk involved to the individual's health, safety and morals, the individual's physical fitness and prior training, the individual's experience and prior earnings, the individual's length of unemployment and prospects for securing local work in the individual's customary occupation and the distance of the available work from the individual's residence.

2. After the first four weeks of a benefit period, the department shall consider any employment offer that pays one hundred twenty percent of the individual's weekly benefit amount to be suitable work.

#### Section 23-777. Disqualification from benefits for unemployment resulting from labor dispute; exceptions; effect on contribution rate

A. An individual shall be disqualified for benefits for any week with respect to which the commission finds that his total or partial unemployment is due to a labor dispute, strike or lockout which exists at the factory, establishment or other premises at which he is or was last employed. This provision shall not apply if it is shown to the satisfaction of the commission that the individual is not participating in, financing or directly interested in the labor dispute, strike or lockout or that he does not belong to a grade or class of workers of which, immediately before the commencement of the labor dispute, strike or lockout, there were members employed at the premises at which the labor dispute, strike or lockout occurs, any of whom are participating in or financing or directly interested in the dispute, strike or lockout. In the case of separate branches of work commonly conducted as separate businesses in separate premises, each department shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be a separate factory, establishment or other premises.

B. If the commission, upon investigation, finds that the dispute, strike or lockout is caused by the failure or refusal of an employer to conform to the provisions of an agreement or contract between employer and employee, or a law of this state or of the United States pertaining to hours, wages or other conditions of work, such dispute, strike or lockout shall not render the workers ineligible for benefits.

C. Benefits paid to an individual as a result of total or partial unemployment due to a labor dispute, strike or lockout shall not be used as a factor in determining the contribution rate of employers of such individual prior to the commencement of the labor dispute, strike or lockout. Where an individual's unemployment subsequent to the termination of a labor dispute, strike or lockout is a result of the labor dispute, strike or lockout, including replacement of former employees by the employer as a legitimate tactic of or response to the labor dispute, strike or lockout, benefits paid to the individual shall not be charged to the account or used as a factor in determining the contribution rate of any base-period employer.

D. "Labor dispute" as used in this section has its ordinary meaning. The existence of a labor dispute does not depend on the existence of a strike, lockout or any other stoppage of work, nor does there have to be any actual unemployment or imminent threat of unemployment or any particular number of individuals involved, before a labor dispute exists.

#### Section 23-778. Disqualification from benefits for fraud

Any person who, within the twenty-four calendar months immediately preceding a week in which he files a valid claim for benefits, has made a false statement or representation of a material fact knowing it to be false, or knowingly failed to disclose a material fact with intent to obtain benefits under this chapter, shall be disqualified for the week for which the claim was filed and for not more than the fifty-one weeks immediately following such week as determined by the commission according to the circumstances in each case.

1. From and after June 30, 2004 and before July 1, 2022, this amount is more than $240, the weekly benefit amount shall be $240.

2. From and after June 30, 2022, this amount is more than $320, the weekly benefit amount shall be $320.

If the weekly benefit amount is less than the maximum weekly benefit prescribed in subsection A of this section and is not a multiple of $1, the amount shall be rounded to the nearest dollar, with an even one-half dollar being rounded to the next higher multiple of $1. An individual's benefit amount shall not be redetermined during the person's benefit year because of a new maximum or minimum weekly benefit amount becoming effective during the person's benefit year.

C. Each eligible individual who is unemployed with respect to any week shall be paid with respect to that week a benefit in an amount equal to the individual's weekly benefit amount less that part of the wages, if any, payable to the individual with respect to that week that is in excess of $30 through June 30, 2022 and from and after June 30, 2022 that is in excess of $160.  The benefit, if not a multiple of $1, shall be rounded to the nearest dollar, with an even one-half dollar being rounded to the next higher multiple of $1.

#### Section 23-780. Duration and amount of benefits; definition

A. An otherwise eligible individual is entitled during a benefit year to a total amount of benefits equal to:

1. Twenty-six times the individual's weekly benefit amount if the unemployment rate in the prior calendar quarter is five percent or more.

2. Twenty-four times the individual's weekly benefit amount if the unemployment rate in the prior calendar quarter is less than five percent.

B. Benefits shall not be payable for weeks of unemployment beginning on and after January 1, 1978, on the basis of services performed by an alien unless such alien is an individual who was lawfully admitted for permanent residence at the time such services were performed, was lawfully present for purposes of performing such services, or was permanently residing in the United States under color of law at the time such services were performed (including an alien who was lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 203(a)(7) or section 212(d)(5) of the immigration and nationality act). Any data or information required of individuals applying for benefits to determine whether benefits are not payable to them because of their alien status shall be uniformly required from all applicants for benefits. In the case of an individual whose application for benefits would otherwise be approved, no determination that benefits to such individual are not payable because of his alien status shall be made except upon a preponderance of the evidence.

Benefits received by an individual, as long as they are not commingled with other funds of the recipient, shall be exempt from any remedy for the collection of all debts except debts incurred for necessaries furnished to the individual or his or her spouse or dependents during the time when the individual was unemployed. No waiver of an exemption provided for in this section shall be valid.

Exempted employers of domestic servants may come under this chapter by complying with its provisions and the rules of the commission. For the purposes of this subsection, "regularly employed" includes all employments, whether continuous throughout the year, or for only a portion of the year, in the usual trade, business, profession or occupation of an employer.

B. When an employer procures work to be done for the employer by a contractor over whose work the employer retains supervision or control, and the work is a part or process in the trade or business of the employer, then the contractors and the contractor's employees, and any subcontractor and the subcontractor's employees, are, within the meaning of this section, employees of the original employer.  For the purposes of this subsection, "part or process in the trade or business of the employer" means a particular work activity that in the context of an ongoing and integral business process is regular, ordinary or routine in the operation of the business or is routinely done through the business' own employees.

Unless the rebuttable presumption is overcome, no premium may be collected by the carrier on payments by the business to the independent contractor if a fully completed written agreement that satisfies the requirements of this subsection is submitted to the carrier. The written agreement shall be dated and contain the signatures of both parties and, unless otherwise provided by law, shall state that the business:

1. Does not require the independent contractor to perform work exclusively for the business. This paragraph shall not be construed as conclusive evidence that an individual who performs services primarily or exclusively for another person is an employee of that person.

2. Does not provide the independent contractor with any business registrations or licenses required to perform the specific services set forth in the contract.

3. Does not pay the independent contractor a salary or hourly rate instead of an amount fixed by contract.

4. Will not terminate the independent contractor before the expiration of the contract period, unless the independent contractor breaches the contract or violates the laws of this state.

5. Does not provide tools to the independent contractor.

6. Does not dictate the time of performance.

7. Pays the independent contractor in the name appearing on the written agreement.

E. A business that uses the services of a sole proprietor who has waived the sole proprietor's rights to workers' compensation coverage and benefits pursuant to section 23-961, subsection M is not liable for workers' compensation coverage or the payment of premiums for the sole proprietor.

F. The written agreement executed in compliance with subsection D of this section shall be null and void and create no presumption of an independent contractor relationship if the consent of either party is either:

1. Obtained through misrepresentation, false statements, fraud or intimidation.

2. Obtained through coercion or duress.

G. If any agreement is found to be null and void under subsection F of this section the insurance carrier is entitled to collect a premium.

 

#### Section 23-903. Application of chapter to persons engaged in interstate commerce; limitation

The provisions of this chapter shall apply to employers and their employees engaged in intrastate and also in interstate and foreign commerce for whom a rule of liability or method of compensation has been or may be established by the United States only to the extent that their mutual connection with intrastate work is clearly separate and distinguishable from interstate or foreign commerce.

#### Section 23-904. Arizona worker injuries in other state; injury to foreign worker in this state; evidence of insurance; judicial notice of other state's laws

A. If a worker who has been hired or is regularly employed in this state receives a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the worker's employment, the worker is entitled to compensation according to the laws of this state even if the injury was received outside this state.

B. If a worker who is employed in this state and is subject to this chapter temporarily leaves this state incidental to that employment and receives an injury arising out of and in the course of employment, the worker, or beneficiaries of the worker if the injury results in death, is entitled to the benefits of this chapter as though the worker were injured in this state.

C. A worker from another state and the employer of the worker in that other state are exempt from this chapter while that worker is temporarily in this state doing work for an employer if all of the following are true:

1. The employer has furnished workers' compensation insurance coverage under the workers' compensation insurance or similar laws of a state other than Arizona so as to cover that worker's employment while in this state.

2. The extraterritorial provisions of this chapter are recognized in that other state.

3. Employers and workers who are covered in this state are likewise exempt from the application of the workers' compensation insurance act or similar laws of the other state.

4. The benefits under the workers' compensation insurance act or similar laws of the other state, or other remedies under a similar act or laws, are the exclusive remedy against the employer for any injury, whether resulting in death or not, received by the worker while temporarily working for that employer in this state.

D. A certificate from a duly authorized officer of the commission, the department of insurance and financial institutions or a similar department of another state certifying that the employer in the other state is insured in that state is prima facie evidence that the employer carries that workers' compensation insurance.

E. If in any appeal or other litigation the construction of the laws of another state is required, the courts shall take judicial notice of the laws of the other state.

F. For the purposes of this section, a worker is deemed to be temporarily in a state doing work for an employer if, during the three hundred sixty-five days immediately preceding either the worker's date of injury or, in the case of an occupational disease or cumulative trauma claim, the worker's last date of injurious exposure, the worker performs fewer than ninety continuous days of required services in the state under the direction and control of the employer.

G. If a worker has a claim under the workers' compensation laws of another state, territory, province or foreign nation for the same injury or occupational disease as the claim filed in this state, the total amount of compensation paid or awarded under the other state's workers' compensation laws shall be credited against the compensation due under the workers' compensation laws of this state.  The worker is entitled to the full amount of compensation due under the laws of this state.  If compensation under the laws of this state is more than the compensation under the laws of the other state, or compensation paid the worker under the laws of the other state is recovered from the worker, the insurer shall pay any unpaid compensation to the worker up to the amount required by the claim under the laws of this state.

H. Claims made after September 13, 2013 are subject to this section regardless of the date of injury.

#### Section 23-905. Minor employees; limitation on payment of lump sum award; additional compensation

A. A minor working at an age and at an occupation legally permitted shall be deemed of the age of majority for the purposes of this chapter, and no other person shall have any claim or right to compensation for an injury to such minor employee, but an award of a lump sum of compensation to the minor employee shall be paid only to his legally appointed guardian.

B. An injured minor who is working at an age and at an occupation which is not legally permitted is entitled to additional compensation in an amount equal to fifty per cent of the compensation the injured minor would otherwise receive pursuant to this chapter. If an insurance carrier is required to pay additional compensation pursuant to this subsection, the insurance carrier shall be subrogated and entitled to recover any such amounts paid from the employer.

#### Section 23-906. Liability under chapter or under common law of employer securing compensation; carriers; service representatives; right of employee to make election; procedure for making election

A. Employers who comply with the provisions of section 23-961 or 23-962 as to securing compensation, and the employers' workers' compensation insurance carriers or administrative service representatives, shall not be liable for damages at common law or by statute, except as provided in this section, for injury or death of an employee wherever occurring, but it shall be optional with employees to accept compensation as provided by this chapter or to reject the provisions of this chapter and retain the right to sue the employer as provided by law.

B. The employee's election to reject the provisions of this chapter shall be made by a notice in writing, signed and dated by him and given to his employer, in duplicate in substantially the following form:

To (name of employer):

You are hereby notified that the undersigned elects to reject the terms, conditions and provisions of the law for the payment of compensation, as provided by the compulsory compensation law of the state of Arizona, and acts amendatory thereto.

C. The notice shall be filed with the employer prior to injuries sustained by the employee, and within five days the employer shall file with his insurance carrier the notice so served by the employee. All employees shall be conclusively presumed to have elected to take compensation in accordance with the terms, conditions and provisions of this chapter unless the notice in writing has been served by the employee upon his employer prior to injury.

D. Every employer engaged in the occupations designated in this chapter shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place upon his premises, in English and Spanish and available for inspection by all workmen, a notice in substantially the following form:

All employees are hereby notified that in the event they do not specifically reject the provisions of the compulsory compensation law they are deemed by the laws of Arizona to have accepted the provisions of such law, and to have elected to accept compensation under the terms of such law, and that under the terms thereof employees have the right to reject the same by written notice thereof prior to any injury sustained, and that blanks and forms for such notice are available to all employees at the office of this company.

E. If an employer fails to post and keep posted the notice as required by this section, or fails to keep available at the place where the employees are hired the blank forms of notice to be signed by the employee, no employee who thereafter engages in employment for such employer, during the time that the notices are not posted or during the time that the blanks are not available, shall be deemed to have accepted the provisions of this chapter, and it shall be optional for such employee, if injured during the period when blanks were not available or the notice was not posted, to accept compensation under the provisions of this chapter or maintain other action against the employer.

#### Section 23-907. Liability of employer failing to secure compensation; defenses; presumption; right of employee to compensation under chapter; information exchange; civil penalties; settlement of disputed claim

A. Employers who are subject to and who fail to comply with section 23-961 or 23-962 shall not be entitled to the benefits of this chapter during the period of noncompliance, but shall be liable in an action under any other applicable law of the state. In such action the defendant shall not avail himself of the defenses of assumption of risk or contributory negligence. In all such actions proof of the injury shall constitute prima facie evidence of negligence on the part of the employer and the burden shall be upon the employer to show freedom from negligence resulting in the injury.

B. An employee of such an employer, or the employee's dependents in case death ensued, in lieu of proceeding against the employer by civil action in court, may file an application with the commission for compensation in accordance with this chapter, and the commission shall hear and determine the application for compensation in the manner other claims are heard and determined before the commission.  Except for a protest of compensability, an employer who protests or petitions the commission for relief of actions or determinations made by the special fund established by section 23-1065 shall be in compliance with section 23-961 or 23-962.  The employer's protest or petition shall include proof that the employer is complying with section 23-961 or 23-962.  The proof shall be either a copy of the declaration page of the workers' compensation insurance policy under section 23-961, subsection A, paragraph 1 or a notice to the commission that the employer is in good standing with the commission under section 23-961, subsection A, paragraph 2.  The compensation so determined shall be paid from the special fund to the person entitled as provided in this section.

C. The special fund may begin the payment of medical or compensation benefits on a claim which involves an employer who has failed to secure compensation as required by section 23-961 and which is processed under subsection B of this section, pending finality of a notice, a determination, an order or a finding and award on a claim, condition or other matter accepted by the special fund.  After payment begins, the payment shall not be interrupted if there is a protest, petition for hearing, request for review or appeal to a higher court by an employer unless, before a notice, determination or order is final, the special fund issues a notice, determination or order that rescinds or amends its prior action or terminates the payment of medical or compensation benefits.  Any overpayment of medical or compensation benefits that occurs shall be credited or adjusted against any future liability on the same claim.  Any overpayment of medical or compensation benefits to a claimant for a claim, condition or matter that is finally determined to be noncompensable shall be borne by the special fund.

D. The commission may spend monies from the special fund that relate to a claim under this section and shall include as part of an employer's liability under this section those expenditures for the employment or contracting of medical, rehabilitation or labor market consultants, experts or examiners that are necessary for processing and determining benefits and assisting in determining the liability of the special fund on a claim.

E. The employer shall be notified of the employer's liability to the special fund periodically and this notice shall include a ten per cent penalty of the amount expended by the special fund or a penalty of one thousand dollars, whichever is greater, plus interest on the amount expended and the penalty pursuant to section 44-1201.  The payments made from the special fund pursuant to the award plus the penalty shall act as a judgment against the employer. The commission shall file the award in the office of the clerk of the superior court in any county in the state and such award shall be entered in the civil order book and judgment docket and when so filed and entered shall be a lien for eight years from the date of the award upon the property of the employer located in the county. Execution may issue thereon within eight years in the same manner and with like effect as if the award were a judgment of the superior court. The commission may recover reasonable attorney fees incurred pursuant to this section. Any civil penalties and interest assessed pursuant to this section shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund and any payments and attorney fees shall be deposited in the special fund account.

F. An employer with one or more employees who is required to comply with this chapter but who fails to obtain coverage through an insurance carrier or as a self-insurer shall be subject to an action by the commission to apply to the court for an injunction which shall cause the employer to cease the operation of business until such employer complies with the provisions of law pertaining thereto.

G. The commission and other state and local governmental agencies may exchange information concerning employers who fail to comply with section 23-961 or 23-962 with other federal, state or local governmental agencies. This exchange of information shall be made only for the purpose of the valid administrative needs of the programs administered by the commission or other agencies and shall not be made for the purpose of criminal prosecution of an employer.

H. The commission may assess a civil penalty of one thousand dollars on an uninsured employer if the commission makes an award for a noncompensable claim against the employer and finds that:

1. At the time of the accident for which the claim was made the employer was subject to this chapter.

2. The employer was not insured pursuant to this chapter.

I. The commission may issue an order assessing a civil penalty of not to exceed one thousand dollars on an employer who is subject to this chapter and who is not insured pursuant to this chapter. The order is final against the employer unless the employer requests a hearing before the commission within fifteen working days after a copy of the order is mailed to the employer. The employer's request for hearing shall specify the facts and grounds that are the basis of the employer's objection to the order issued under this subsection.  Following the hearing the commission may affirm, reverse or modify its order and shall serve a copy of its decision by first class mail on the employer. An employer aggrieved by this decision may seek judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

J. If the commission has assessed a civil penalty under this section against an employer within the previous five years for failure to secure workers' compensation as required under this chapter, the commission may assess an additional civil penalty against the employer that:

1. Does not exceed five thousand dollars for the second failure to secure the payment of compensation.

2. Does not exceed ten thousand dollars for a third or subsequent failure to secure the payment of compensation.  As an aggravating factor only, the commission may consider the economic benefit that the employer received by failing to comply with this chapter.

K. In determining the amount of the final penalty under subsection H, I or J of this section, the commission may consider any relevant factor to waive or reduce the penalty, including:

1. The history of the employer's noncompliance with section 23-961 or 23-962.

2. The history of no insurance claims filed against the employer.

3. Whether the failure to secure workers' compensation coverage was inadvertent.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "inadvertent" includes a lapse in coverage of not more than thirty days if there is a change of insurance carrier, a change of ownership or a change in the form of the business.

4. Whether the failure to secure workers' compensation coverage was because the employer was a victim of fraud, misrepresentation or gross negligence by an insurance agent or broker or by a person whom a reasonable person would believe is an insurance agent or broker.

L. Civil penalties assessed pursuant to subsections H, I and J of this section are payable to the state general fund and shall act as a judgment in the same manner as prescribed in subsection E of this section. Recovery of attorney fees and accrual of interest are the same as prescribed in subsection E of this section.

M. The commission may compromise or otherwise settle a disputed claim with an employee of an employer who is subject to and who fails to comply with section 23-961 or 23-962 by filing a notice of compromise and settlement or notice of stipulation with the presiding administrative law judge. The notice shall be served on the employer at the last known mailing address as shown on the records of the commission. The employer shall keep the commission informed of its current mailing address once the employer has been notified by the commission of the filing of a claim against the employer. If the employer does not request a hearing protesting the terms of the agreement or stipulation within ten working days of the service of the notice, the commission and the employee may execute the agreement or stipulation without the consent of the employer, subject to the approval of the presiding administrative law judge. Any payments made to the employee pursuant to this subsection shall be paid from the special fund and are subject to reimbursement and collection from the employer in the same manner as other payments made pursuant to this chapter.

#### Section 23-908. Injury reports by employer and physician; schedule of fees; notification; public meeting; violation; classification

A. Every employer that is affected by this chapter, and every physician who attends an injured employee of that employer, shall file with the commission and the employer's insurance carrier from time to time a full and complete report of every known injury to the employee arising out of or in the course of employment and resulting in loss of life or injury requiring medical treatment. The report shall be furnished to the commission and the insurance carrier at times and in the form and detail the commission prescribes, and the report shall make special answers to all questions required by the commission under its rules. For the purposes of this subsection, medical treatment does not include any onetime, short-term treatment by nonmedical staff that requires little technology or training to administer, including treatment of minor scratches, cuts, burns and splinters and other issues that ordinarily do not require medical care.

B. The commission shall fix a schedule of fees to be charged by physicians, physical therapists or occupational therapists attending injured employees and, subject to subsection C of this section, for prescription medicines required to treat an injured employee under this chapter. Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, the schedule of fees may include other reimbursement guidelines for medications dispensed in settings that are not accessible to the general public.  The commission shall annually review the schedule of fees. For the purposes of this subsection, settings that are not accessible to the general public do not include mail order pharmacies delivering pharmaceutical services to workers' compensation claimants, if both of the following apply:

1. The pharmacy does not limit or restrict access to claimants with an affiliation to a medical provider or other entity.

2. Any medical provider or other entity referring a claimant to the pharmacy does not receive or accept any rebate, refund, commission, preference or other consideration as compensation for the referral.

C. If a schedule of fees for prescription medicines adopted pursuant to subsection B of this section includes provisions regarding the use of generic equivalent drugs or interchangeable biological products, those provisions shall comply with section 32-1963.01, subsections A, B and D through L. If the commission considers the adoption of fee schedule provisions that involve specific prices, values or reimbursements for prescription drugs, the commission shall base the adoption on studies or practices that are validated and accepted in the industry, including the applicability of formulas that use average wholesale price, plus a dispensing fee, and that have been made publicly available for at least one hundred eighty days before any hearing conducted by the commission.  Before the commission takes final action on the schedule of fees pursuant to this subsection and subsection B of this section, except during a public health emergency, the commission shall:

1. Prominently post on its publicly accessible website the proposed schedule of fees at least thirty days before conducting a public hearing on that proposed schedule of fees.

2. Hold at least one meeting that all interested parties may jointly attend and interactively participate in after posting the proposed schedule of fees but before conducting the hearing on the proposed schedule of fees.

3. At least seven business days in advance, prominently post on its publicly accessible website the final proposed schedule of fees to be acted on for adoption.

D. Notwithstanding section 12-2235, information obtained by any physician or surgeon examining or treating an injured person shall not be considered a privileged communication if that information is requested by interested parties for a proper understanding of the case and a determination of the rights involved. Hospital records of an employee concerning an industrial claim shall not be considered privileged if requested by an interested party in order to determine the rights involved. Medical information from any source pertaining to conditions unrelated to the pending industrial claim shall remain privileged.

E. When an accident occurs to an employee, the employee shall forthwith report the accident and the injury resulting from the accident to the employer, and any physician employed by the injured employee shall forthwith report the accident and the injury resulting from the accident to the employer, the insurance carrier and the commission.

F. If an accident occurs to an employee, the employer may designate in writing a physician chosen by the employer, who shall be allowed by the employee, or any person in charge of the employee, to make one examination of the injured employee in order to ascertain the character and extent of the injury occasioned by the accident. The physician so chosen shall forthwith report to the employer, the insurance carrier and the commission the character and extent of the injury as the physician ascertains. If the accident is not reported by the employee or the employee's physician forthwith, as required, or if the injured employee or those in charge of the employee refuse to allow the employer's physician to make the examination, and the injured employee is a party to the refusal, no compensation shall be paid for the injury claimed to have resulted from the accident. The commission may relieve the injured person or that person's dependents from the loss or forfeiture of compensation if it believes after investigation that the circumstances attending the failure on the part of the employee or physician to report the accident and injury are such as to have excused them.

G. Within ten days after receiving notice of an accident, the employer shall inform the insurance carrier and the commission on the forms and in the manner as prescribed by the commission.

H. Immediately on notice to the employer of an accident resulting in an injury to an employee, the employer shall provide the employee with the name and address of the employer's insurance carrier, the policy number and the expiration date.

I. Any person failing or refusing to comply with this section is guilty of a petty offense.

J. Subsection B of this section does not prohibit:

1. A health care provider or pharmacy from entering into a separate contract or network that governs fees, in which case reimbursement shall be made according to the applicable contracted charge or negotiated rate.

2. An employer from directing medical, surgical or hospital care pursuant to section 23-1070.

#### Section 23-909. Motion picture exemption

A. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to employers and their employees engaged in any phase of the motion picture business that meet all of the following requirements:

1. The motion picture company engaging in such work is temporarily within the state for a period not to exceed eight months.

2. Such motion picture company is otherwise insured by a recognized insurance company where the premiums and benefits under such other insurance are at least equal to those provided in the workers' compensation laws in the state in which such company is incorporated, or if not incorporated, has its principal offices.

B. All Arizona residents employed by any company fulfilling the exemption requirements of this section shall execute a form rejecting the provisions of the compulsory compensation law of the state of Arizona and accepting the insurance coverage provided in this section. The form shall be in writing, signed and dated by the employee and given to his employer in duplicate in substantially the following form: "TO (name of employer): You are hereby notified that the undersigned elects to reject the terms, conditions and provisions of the law for the payment of compensation, as provided by the compulsory compensation law of the state of Arizona, and acts amendatory thereto. The undersigned elects to come under the policy of insurance in __________________ insurance company secured by you and which carries similar premiums and benefits as provided under the compensation laws of the state of ________________________."

C. The provisions of section 23-906 shall apply to the insurance provided by the employer in this section, and shall be construed so that any reference to compulsory compensation of Arizona in such section is interpreted to include the insurance provided under this section. An election to come under the provisions of the insurance in this section shall not render the employer liable for damages of common law.

#### Section 23-910. Exemption for licensees

The provisions of this chapter do not apply to a person who performs the services of a licensee as defined in section 32-2101 under the following conditions:

1. Substantially all of the remunerations whether or not paid in cash for services performed by an individual as a real estate licensee are directly related to sales or other output including the performance of services rather than the number of hours worked.

2. The services performed by the licensee are performed pursuant to a written contract between the licensee and the person for whom the services are performed and such contract provides that the licensee will not be treated as an employee with respect to such services for federal tax purposes and for the purposes of this chapter.

### Article 2 - Administration and Enforcement

C. The commission may incur such expenses as it determines are reasonably necessary to perform its authorized functions, which expenses shall be a charge against the administrative fund.

D. The commission may charge any person with contempt who refuses to comply with any order of the commission, upon application to the superior court. Any person held in contempt may be punished by a fine of not to exceed one thousand dollars.

#### Section 23-926. Inspection of employer records; noncompliance by employer; penalty

A. All books, records and payrolls of the employer, including nonconfidential employer records on file with other state or local governmental agencies, showing or reflecting in any way the wage expenditure of the employer shall always be open for inspection by the commission or its assistants to ascertain information necessary for its administration of the law.

B. An employer who refuses to submit his books, records and payrolls for inspection as provided by this section is liable for a penalty of five hundred dollars for each offense which shall be collected by a civil action in the name of the state, and the recovery shall be paid to the state general fund.

B. In the discharge of his duties, the agent shall have the inquisitorial powers granted by this chapter to the commission and the same powers with regard to taking testimony as a referee or master appointed by a superior court. The recommendation made by such agent shall be advisory only and shall not preclude taking further evidence or making further investigations.

The commission may compromise any action.

#### Section 23-930. Unfair claim processing practices; bad faith; civil penalties

A. The commission has exclusive jurisdiction as prescribed in this section over complaints involving alleged unfair claim processing practices or bad faith by an employer, self-insured employer, insurance carrier or claims processing representative relating to any aspect of this chapter.

C. If the commission finds that an employer, self-insured employer, insurance carrier or claim processing representative has a history or pattern of repeated unfair claim processing practices or bad faith, it may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation found. The civil penalty shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the state general fund.

E. The commission shall adopt by rule a definition of unfair claim processing practices and bad faith.

#### Section 23-961. Methods of securing compensation by employers; deficit premium; civil penalty

A. Employers shall secure workers' compensation to their employees in one of the following ways:

1. By insuring and keeping insured the payment of such compensation with an insurance carrier authorized by the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions to write workers' compensation insurance in this state.

2. By furnishing to the commission satisfactory proof of financial ability to pay the compensation directly or through a workers' compensation pool approved by the commission in the amount and manner and when due as provided in this chapter. The requirements of this paragraph may be satisfied by furnishing to the commission satisfactory proof that the employer is a member of a workers' compensation pool approved by the commission pursuant to section 23-961.01. The commission may require a deposit or any other security from the employer for the payment of compensation liabilities in an amount fixed by the commission, but not less than $100,000 dollars for workers' compensation liabilities.  If the employer does not fully comply with the provisions of this chapter relating to the payment of compensation, the commission may revoke the authority of the employer to pay compensation directly.

B. An employer may not secure compensation to comply with this chapter by any mechanism other than as provided in this section. No insurance, combination or other program may be marketed, offered or sold as workers' compensation that does not comply with this section.  An employer violates this chapter if the employer purchases or secures its obligations under this chapter through a substitute for workers' compensation that does not comply with this section.

C. Insurance carriers that transact the business of workers' compensation insurance in this state are subject to the rules of the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions.

D. On application of an insurance carrier, the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions may order the release to the insurance carrier of all or part of the cash or securities that the insurance carrier deposited before July 1, 2015 with the state treasurer pursuant to this section.  In determining whether to order the release of all or part of the deposit, the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions shall consider all of the following:

1. The financial condition of the insurance carrier.

2. The insurance carrier's liabilities for workers' compensation loss and loss expenses in this state.

3. Whether the insurance carrier is subject to a finding of hazardous condition, an order of supervision, a delinquency proceeding or any other regulatory action in this state, the insurance carrier's state of domicile or any other state in which the insurance carrier transacted the business of insurance.

4. Any other factors the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions determines are relevant to the application for release of the deposit.

E. Except in the event of nonpayment of premiums, each insurance carrier shall carry a risk to the conclusion of the policy period unless the policy is cancelled by the employer or unless one or both of the parties to a professional employer agreement terminate the agreement.  The policy period shall be agreed on by the insurance carrier and the employer.

F. At least thirty days' notice shall be given by the insurance carrier to the employer and to the commission of any cancellation or nonrenewal of a policy if the cancellation or nonrenewal is at the election of the insurance carrier.  The insurance carrier shall promptly notify the commission of any cancellation by the employer or failure of the employer to renew the policy. The failure to give notice of nonrenewal if the nonrenewal is at the election of the insurance carrier shall not extend coverage beyond the policy period.  An insurance carrier shall notify the commission on a form prescribed by the commission that it has insured an employer for workers' compensation promptly after undertaking to insure the employer.

G. Every insurance carrier on or before March 1 of each year shall pay to the state treasurer for the credit of the administrative fund, in lieu of all other taxes on workers' compensation insurance, a tax of not more than three percent on all premiums collected or contracted for during the year ending December 31 next preceding, less the deductions from such total direct premiums for applicable cancellations, returned premiums and all policy dividends or refunds paid or credited to policyholders within this state and not reapplied as premiums for new, additional or extended insurance.  Every self-insured employer, including workers' compensation pools, on or before March 31 of each year shall pay a tax of not more than three percent of the premiums that would have been paid by the employer if the employer had been fully insured by an insurance carrier authorized to transact workers' compensation insurance in this state during the preceding calendar year. The commission shall adopt rules that shall specify the premium plans and methods to be used for the calculation of rates and premiums and that shall be the basis for the taxes assessed to self-insured employers.  The tax shall be not less than $250 per annum and shall be computed and collected by the commission and paid to the state treasurer for the credit of the administrative fund at a rate not exceeding three percent to be fixed annually by the industrial commission of Arizona.  The rate shall be no more than is necessary to cover the actual expenses of the industrial commission of Arizona in carrying out its powers and duties under this title.  Any quarterly payments of tax pursuant to subsection I of this section shall be deducted from the tax payable pursuant to this subsection.

H. An insurance carrier may reduce the amount of premiums paid by an employer by up to five percent if all of the following apply:

1. The insured employer complies with the drug testing policy requirements prescribed in section 23-493.04.

2. The insured employer conducts drug testing of prospective employees.

3. The insured employer conducts drug testing of an employee after the employee has been injured.

The quarterly payments shall be due and payable on or before the last day of the month following the close of the quarter and shall be made to the state treasurer.

J. If an overpayment of taxes results from the method prescribed in subsection I of this section the industrial commission of Arizona may refund the overpayment without interest.

K. An insurer who fails to pay the tax prescribed by subsection G or I of this section or the amount prescribed by section 23-1065, subsection A is subject to a civil penalty equal to the greater of $25 or five percent of the tax or amount due plus interest at the rate of one percent per month from the date the tax or amount was due.

L. An insurance carrier authorized to write workers' compensation insurance may not assess an employer premiums for services provided by a contractor alleged to be an employee under section 23-902, subsection B or C, unless the carrier has done both of the following:

1. Prepared written audit or field investigation findings establishing that all applicable factors for determining employment status under section 23-902 have been met.

2. Provided a copy of such findings to the employer in advance of assessing a premium.

M. Notwithstanding section 23-901, paragraph 6, subdivision (i), a sole proprietor may waive the sole proprietor's rights to workers' compensation coverage and benefits if both the sole proprietor and the insurance carrier of the employer subject to this chapter for which the sole proprietor performs services sign and date a waiver that is substantially in the following form:

I am a sole proprietor, and I am doing business as  (name of sole proprietor)  .  I am performing work as an independent contractor for   (name of employer)  .  I am not the employee of   (name of employer)   for workers' compensation purposes, and, therefore, I am not entitled to workers' compensation benefits from   (name of employer)  .  I understand that if I have any employees working for me, I must maintain workers' compensation insurance on them.

Effective July 1, 1983, this state through the department of administration shall self-insure its liability, if any, under chapter 5 of this title and this chapter without the necessity of complying with section 23-961, subsection A, paragraph 2. On or before June 30, 1983, the state compensation fund and the department of administration shall enter into an interagency contract pursuant to title 11, chapter 7, article 3 for the return to this state of the reserves established and held by the state compensation fund for all claims against this state that were incurred on or before that date. These reserves shall be credited to the state general fund.  The department of administration shall direct the continuing payment and processing of all claims against this state for injuries to state employees that were incurred both before and after July 1, 1983.  All claims payments shall be made or reimbursed by the department on behalf of this state and for expenses incurred in connection with the payment and processing of such claims. The department of administration may procure excess loss coverage from an insurance carrier for individual or aggregate claims, or both, in such amounts and at such primary retention levels as the department of administration deems in the best interest of the state.

B. The clerk of the board of supervisors of each county, the clerk of each political subdivision and the superintendent of each school district that insures its workers' compensation liability with an insurance carrier shall furnish quarterly to the insurance carrier a true payroll showing the total amount paid to employees subject to the provisions of this chapter during each month of the quarter, segregated in accordance with the requirements of the insurance carrier.

C. Each clerk and school superintendent shall thereupon prepare and submit to his respective governing body for approval a claim for the amount of premiums due the insurance carrier. Such premiums shall be at once paid to the insurance carrier by the proper officer. The department of administration shall draw a warrant for such premiums as are due until June 30, 1983 from the state in favor of the treasurer for the benefit of the insurance carrier and the treasurer shall at once pay the warrant from the general fund and the appropriation made therefor in the general appropriation bill for the insurance carrier.

 

#### Section 23-963. Provisions of compensation insurance policy

Every policy of insurance covering the liability of the employer for workers' compensation shall cover the entire liability of the employer to his employees covered by the policy or contract, and be deemed to contain the following provisions:

1. That as between the employee and the insurance carrier the notice to or knowledge of the occurrence of the injury on the part of the employer shall be deemed notice or knowledge of the insurance carrier.

2. That jurisdiction of the employer shall be jurisdiction of the insurance carrier.

3. That the insurance carrier shall be bound by and subject to the orders, findings, decisions and awards rendered against the employer for payment of compensation.

4. That the insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer and his discharge therein shall not relieve the insurance carrier or workers' compensation pool from payment of compensation for injuries or death sustained by an employee during the life of the policy or contract.

 

#### Section 23-963.01. Policies with deductible coverage; medical-only loss

A. Notwithstanding section 23-963, an insurance carrier authorized to transact workers' compensation insurance in this state may offer deductible coverage to employers. Deductible coverage shall be effected by attaching a benefits deductible endorsement to the policy. The endorsement shall specify whether loss adjustment expenses are to be treated as advancements within the deductible to be reimbursed by the employer. The policyholder exercising the deductible option shall choose only one deductible amount. Premium reductions for deductibles shall be determined before applying any experience modification, premium surcharge or premium discount. If an insurance carrier offers deductible coverage to an employer, the employer shall submit a certified copy of the employer's most recent financial statement to the insurance carrier to justify the deductible amount the employer chooses. The insurance carrier shall retain a copy of the financial statement for three years.

B. Any compensable claim for benefits shall be paid by the carrier. The employer shall reimburse the carrier for any deductible amounts paid by the carrier. The employer is liable for reimbursement up to the limit of the chosen deductible. The payment or nonpayment of deductible amounts by the insured employer to the carrier shall be treated under the policy in the same manner as payment or nonpayment of premiums.

C. The nonpayment of deductible amounts by the insured employer to the carrier under subsection B of this section shall not relieve the insurance carrier from paying compensation for injuries or death sustained by an employee during the period of time the agreement, contract or policy was in effect. No agreements, contracts or policies providing deductible amounts for workers' compensation coverage shall be terminated retroactively for nonpayment of deductible amounts.

D. Losses subject to the deductible shall be reported and recorded as losses for purposes of calculating rates for a policyholder on the same basis as losses under policies providing first dollar coverage.

E. Notwithstanding any other law, for any claim involving medical-only loss, any experience rating adjustment as determined by a national nonprofit insurance rating organization shall be applied to reduce the impact of the loss in the employer's experience modification calculation. For the purposes of this subsection, "medical-only loss" means loss that has no indemnity value reflecting lost wages.

#### Section 23-964. Posting notice of compliance with compensation law

A. Each employer providing insurance or electing to pay compensation directly as provided in this chapter, shall post in conspicuous places about his place of business typewritten or printed notices stating that he has complied with the provisions of this chapter and all rules and regulations of the commission made in pursuance thereof and, if such is the fact, has been authorized by the commission directly to compensate his employees or their dependents.

B. The notices when posted shall constitute sufficient notice to the employees of the fact that the employer has complied with the law for securing compensation to his employees and their dependents.

#### Section 23-966. Failure of employer to pay claim or comply with commission order; reimbursement of funds

A. If a self-insured employer or other employer authorized by the commission to process or pay claims directly pursuant to this chapter does not fully comply with the provisions of the workers' compensation law relating to the processing or payment of compensation, medical benefits or the final orders of the commission, the workers' compensation claims shall be assigned by the commission to the special fund established by section 23-1065. The special fund shall ensure that these claims are processed and that compensation, benefits or amounts due are paid. The special fund may use third-party processors or other legal, medical, claims or labor market personnel to assist in the processing and payment of claims assigned under this section.

B. In addition to expenditures authorized under subsection A of this section, the special fund may use monies for any expense or service that is necessary to ensure that claims assigned under subsection A of this section are processed and paid, necessary to assist in the determination of liability of a claim that is assigned under this section or necessary to assist in the collection of monies owed to the special fund under this section, including collection against the cash, securities, bond and other assets of the employer. These expenses may include travel, discovery procedures and employing any third-party processor, expert, consultant or professional, including an attorney, auditor, examiner or actuary. The special fund shall reimburse the administrative fund for all expenses incurred by the administrative fund related to the processing and payment of claims assigned under this section.

C. The special fund is the successor in interest to all excess insurance policies in effect at the time of an assignment under subsection A of this section that insure any part of the self-insured employer's financial obligations under the workers' compensation laws.  The special fund's recovery rights under this subsection are subject to applicable coverage terms and policy limits in the excess policy.  The excess insurer shall make payment directly to the special fund for all covered amounts spent under this section, including administrative costs, necessary expenses and attorney fees to the extent covered by the excess policy.  Unless recovered from an excess insurer, the special fund shall have a claim against the employer for all monies that are spent or anticipated to be spent under this section, including administrative costs, necessary expenses and attorney fees. Any claim by the special fund shall be made on the cash, securities or bond filed under section 23-961 or applicable rules or on any other asset of the employer.

#### Section 23-967. Deduction of premium from employee wage or salary; violation; classification

#### Section 23-970. Misrepresentation of payroll, job description, job function or loss history affecting premium payment; violation; classification; penalty; statute of limitations; civil action

A. It is unlawful for an employer to wilfully misrepresent to an insurance carrier the amount of payroll, the job description or job function of an employee, or the employer's loss history, on which the premium for workers' compensation insurance to be paid to the insurance carrier is based.

B. An employer that violates subsection A is guilty of a class 6 felony.

C. In addition to the punishment that may be imposed pursuant to subsection B, an employer that violates subsection A is liable for a penalty of up to three times the amount of the difference in premium paid and the amount the employer should have paid. The penalty shall be collected in a civil action by the insurance carrier, in addition to any other damages that are incurred by the insurance carrier due to the misrepresentation, including costs and attorney fees. The insurance carrier shall initiate the civil action within four years after the date the insurance carrier knew or with the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known of the misrepresentation. The insurance carrier may initiate the civil action regardless of whether a criminal action is brought against the employer.

#### Section 23-1022. Compensation as exclusive remedy for employees; definition; exceptions; public agency employees

#### Section 23-1023. Liability of third person to injured employee; election of remedies

A. If an employee who is entitled to compensation under this chapter is injured or killed or further aggravates a previously accepted industrial injury by the negligence or wrong of another person not in the same employ, the injured employee, or in event of death the injured employee's dependents, may pursue the injured person's remedy against the other person.

B. If the employee who is entitled to compensation under this chapter or the employee's dependents do not pursue a remedy pursuant to this section against the other person by instituting an action within one year after the cause of action accrues, or if after instituting the action, the employee or the employee's dependents fail to fully prosecute the claim and the action is dismissed, the claim against the other person is deemed assigned to the insurance carrier or self-insured employer and all of the following apply:

1. The insurance carrier or self-insured employer may institute an action against the other person.

2. Any dismissal that is entered for lack of prosecution of an action instituted by the employee or the employee's dependents shall not prejudice the right of the insurance carrier or self-insured employer to recover the amount of benefits paid.

3. If the statute of limitations of the claim is one year after the cause of action accrues, the insurance carrier or self-insured employer may file the action prior to one year after the cause of action accrues.

4. The claim may be prosecuted or compromised by the insurance carrier or the person liable for the self-insured employer or may be reassigned in its entirety to the employee or the employee's dependents. After the reassignment, the employee who is entitled to compensation, or the employee's dependents, shall have the same rights to pursue the claim as if it had been filed within the first year.

C. The employee or the employee's dependents shall provide the insurance carrier or the self-insured employer written notice of the intention to bring an action against a third party and shall provide to the insurance carrier or self-insured employer timely and periodic notice of all pleadings and rulings concerning the status of the pending action.  In any action instituted by the employee or the employee's dependents, the insurance carrier or the self-insured employer shall have the right to intervene at any time to protect the insurance carrier's or the self-insured employer's interests.

D. If the employee proceeds against the other person, compensation and medical, surgical and hospital benefits shall be paid as provided in this chapter and the insurance carrier or other person liable to pay the claim shall have a lien on the amount actually collectable from the other person to the extent of such compensation and medical, surgical and hospital benefits paid. This lien shall not be subject to a collection fee. The amount actually collectable shall be the total recovery less the reasonable and necessary expenses, including attorney fees, actually expended in securing the recovery.  In any action arising out of an aggravation of a previously accepted industrial injury, the lien shall only apply to amounts expended for compensation and treatment of the aggravation. The insurance carrier or person shall contribute only the deficiency between the amount actually collected and the compensation and medical, surgical and hospital benefits provided or estimated by this chapter for the case.  Compromise of any claim by the employee or the employee's dependents at an amount less than the compensation and medical, surgical and hospital benefits provided for shall be made only with written approval of the insurance carrier or self-insured employer liable to pay the claim.

#### Section 23-1024. Choice of remedy as waiver of alternate remedy

#### Section 23-1026. Periodic medical examination of employee; effect of refusal or obstruction of examination or treatment

A. An employee who may be entitled to compensation under this chapter shall submit the employee for medical examination from time to time at a place reasonably convenient for the employee, if and when requested by the commission, the employee's employer or the insurance carrier.  A place is reasonably convenient even if it is not where the employee resides if it is the place where the employee was injured and the employer or the insurance carrier pays in advance the employee's reasonable travel expenses, including the cost of transportation, food, lodging and loss of pay, if applicable.

B. The request for the medical examination shall fix a time and place having regard to the convenience of the employee, the employee's physical condition and the employee's ability to attend.  A medical examination may be conducted via telehealth as defined in section 36-3601 with the consent of both the employee and the requesting party. The employee may have a physician present at the examination if procured and paid for by the employee.

On appropriate application and hearing, the commission may reduce or suspend the compensation of an employee who persists in unsanitary or injurious practices tending to imperil or retard the employee's recovery or who refuses to submit to medical or surgical treatment reasonably necessary to promote the employee's recovery.

F. An employee shall be excused from attending a scheduled medical examination if the employee requests a protective order and the administrative law judge finds that the scheduled examination is unnecessary, would be cumulative or could reasonably be timely scheduled with an appropriate physician where the employee resides. If a protective order is requested, the burden is on the employer or insurance carrier to establish that a medical examination should be scheduled at a place other than where the employee resides. If an employee has left this state and the employer or insurance carrier pays in advance the employee's reasonable travel expenses, including the cost of transportation, food, lodging and loss of pay, if applicable, the employer or insurance carrier is entitled to have the employee return to this state one time a year for examination or one time following the filing of a petition to reopen.

### Article 8 - Amount of Compensation

#### Section 23-1041. Basis for computing compensation; definition

A. Every employee of an employer within the provisions of this chapter who is injured by accident arising out of and in the course of employment, or the employee's dependents in the event of the employee's death, shall receive the compensation fixed in this chapter on the basis of the employee's average monthly wage at the time of injury.

B. If the injured or killed employee has not been continuously employed for the period of thirty days immediately preceding the injury or death, the average monthly wage shall be such amount as, having regard to the previous wage of the injured employee or of other employees of the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring locality, reasonably represents the monthly earning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which the injured employee is working at the time of the accident.

C. If the employee is working under a contract by which the employee is guaranteed an amount per diem or per month, notwithstanding the contract price for such labor, the employee or the employee's subordinates or employees working under the terms of such contract or the employee's or their dependents in case of death shall be entitled to receive compensation on the basis only of the guaranteed wage as set out in the contract of employment, whether paid on a per diem or monthly basis, but in no event shall the basis be less than the wages paid to employees for similar work not under contract.

D. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, in computing the average monthly wage there shall be excluded from such computation all wages or other compensation for services in excess of:

1. One thousand three hundred twenty-five dollars per month for employees injured before January 1, 1988.

E. For purposes of subsection D, paragraph 8, the commission, not later than August 1 of each calendar year, beginning August 1, 2009, shall adopt an amount that adjusts the amount from the prior year to reflect the annual percentage increase in the bureau of labor statistics employment cost index for the prior calendar year.  The amount adopted by the commission shall be effective for the following calendar year and shall apply to all injuries occurring during that calendar year.  In adopting the amount under this subsection, the commission shall not decrease the amount from the prior year or increase the amount more than five per cent from the prior year.

#### Section 23-1042. Basis for computing average monthly wage of minor permanently incapacitated

If it is established by competent evidence that an injured employee is under eighteen years of age and his incapacity is permanent, his average monthly earning capacity shall be deemed, within the limits fixed by sections 23-1041 and 23-1046, to be the monthly amount which under ordinary circumstances he would probably be able to earn at the age of eighteen years in the occupation in which he was employed at the time of injury, or in any occupation to which he would reasonably have been promoted if he had not been injured. If the probable earnings at the age of eighteen years cannot be reasonably determined, his average earnings shall be based upon four dollars per day for a six-day week.

#### Section 23-1043. Hernias classified for compensation purposes

All hernias are considered injuries within the provisions of this chapter causing incapacitating conditions or permanent disability, and until otherwise ordered by the commission, the following rules for rating hernias shall govern:

1. Real traumatic hernia is an injury to the abdominal wall of sufficient severity to puncture or tear asunder the wall, and permit the exposure or protrusion of the abdominal viscera or some part thereof. Such injury will be compensated as a temporary total disability and as a partial permanent disability, depending upon the lessening of the injured individual's earning capacity.

2. All other hernias, whenever occurring or discovered and whatsoever the cause, except as under paragraph 1 of this section, are considered diseases causing incapacitating conditions or permanent partial disability, but the permanent partial disability and the causes thereof are considered to be as shown by medical facts to have either existed from birth, to have been years in formation, or both, and are not compensatory, unless it is proved:

(a) That the immediate cause, which calls attention to the presence of the hernia, was a sudden effort or severe strain or blow received while in the course of employment.

(b) That the descent of the hernia occurred immediately following the cause.

(c) That the cause was accompanied or immediately followed by severe pain in the hernial region.

(d) That the facts in subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of this paragraph were of such severity that they were noticed by the claimant and communicated immediately to one or more persons.

If the facts in subdivisions (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this paragraph are proven, the hernias are considered to be aggravations of previous ailments or diseases, and will be compensated as such for time lost only to a limited extent, depending upon the nature of the proof submitted and the result of the local medical examination, but for not to exceed two months. Hernias of every kind shall be compensated pursuant to this paragraph unless the claimant proves to the satisfaction of the commission by a preponderance of the evidence that the hernia is a real traumatic hernia as defined in paragraph 1.

#### Section 23-1043.01. Heart-related and mental cases

A. A heart-related or perivascular injury, illness or death shall not be considered a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment and is not compensable pursuant to this chapter unless some injury, stress or exertion related to the employment was a substantial contributing cause of the heart-related or perivascular injury, illness or death.

B. A mental injury, illness or condition shall not be considered a personal injury by accident arising out of and in the course of employment and is not compensable pursuant to this chapter unless some unexpected, unusual or extraordinary stress related to the employment or some physical injury related to the employment was a substantial contributing cause of the mental injury, illness or condition.

C. If compensation is payable for a heart-related or perivascular injury, illness or death, or for a mental injury, illness or condition, the only employer liable is the employee's last employer in whose employment the requirements of subsection A or B are met.

#### Section 23-1043.02. Human immunodeficiency virus; establishing exposure; definition

A. A claim for a condition, infection, disease or disability involving or related to the human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome shall include the occurrence of a significant exposure as defined in this section and, except as provided in subsection B of this section, shall be processed and determined under the provisions of this chapter and applicable principles of law.

B. Notwithstanding any other law, an employee who satisfies the following conditions presents a prima facie claim for a condition, infection, disease or disability involving or related to the human immunodeficiency virus or acquired immune deficiency syndrome if the medical evidence shows to a reasonable degree of medical probability that the employee sustained a significant exposure within the meaning of this section:

1. The employee's regular course of employment involves handling or exposure to blood or body fluids, other than tears, saliva or perspiration, including health care providers as defined in title 36, chapter 6, article 4, forensic laboratory workers, fire fighters, law enforcement officers, emergency medical technicians, paramedics and correctional officers.

2. Within ten calendar days after a possible significant exposure which arises out of and in the course of his employment, the employee reports in writing to the employer the details of the exposure. The employer shall notify its insurance carrier or claims processor of the report. Failure of the employer to notify the insurance carrier is not a defense to a claim by the employee.

3. The employee has blood drawn within ten days after the possible significant exposure, the blood is tested for the human immunodeficiency virus by antibody testing within thirty days after the exposure and the test results are negative.

4. The employee is tested or diagnosed, according to clinical standards established by the centers for disease control of the United States public health service, as positive for the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus within eighteen months after the date of the possible significant exposure.

C. On presentation or showing of a prima facie claim under this section, the employer may produce specific, relevant and probative evidence to dispute the underlying facts, to contest whether the exposure was significant as defined in this section, or to establish an alternative significant exposure involving the presence of the human immunodeficiency virus.

D. A person alleged to be a source of a significant exposure shall not be compelled by subpoena or other court order to release confidential human immunodeficiency virus related information either by document or by oral testimony. Evidence of the alleged source's human immunodeficiency virus status may be introduced by either party if the alleged source knowingly and willingly consents to the release of that information.

E. Notwithstanding title 36, chapter 6, article 4, medical information regarding the employee obtained by a physician or surgeon is subject to the provisions of section 23-908, subsection D.

F. The commission by rule shall prescribe requirements and forms regarding employee notification of the requirements of this section and the proper documentation of a significant exposure.

G. For the purposes of this section, "significant exposure" means contact of an employee's ruptured or broken skin or mucous membrane with a person's blood or body fluids, other than tears, saliva or perspiration, of a magnitude that the centers for disease control have epidemiologically demonstrated can result in transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. For purposes of filing a claim under this section, significant exposure does not include sexual activity or illegal drug use.

#### Section 23-1044. Compensation for partial disability; computation

A. For temporary partial disability there shall be paid during the period thereof sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the difference between the wages earned before the injury and the wages that the injured person is able to earn thereafter. Unemployment benefits received during the period of temporary partial disability shall be considered wages able to be earned.

B. Disability shall be deemed permanent partial disability if caused by any of the following specified injuries, and compensation of fifty-five percent of the average monthly wage of the injured employee, in addition to the compensation for temporary total disability, shall be paid for the period given in the following schedule:

1. For the loss of a thumb, fifteen months.

2. For the loss of a first finger, commonly called the index finger, nine months.

3. For the loss of a second finger, seven months.

4. For the loss of a third finger, five months.

5. For the loss of the fourth finger, commonly called the little finger, four months.

6. The loss of a distal or second phalange of the thumb or the distal or third phalange of the first, second, third or fourth finger, shall be considered equal to the loss of one-half of the thumb or finger, and compensation shall be one-half of the amount specified for the loss of the entire thumb or finger.

7. The loss of more than one phalange of the thumb or finger shall be considered as the loss of the entire finger or thumb, but in no event shall the amount received for more than one finger exceed the amount provided for the loss of a hand.

8. For the loss of a great toe, seven months.

9. For the loss of a toe other than the great toe, two and one-half months.

10. The loss of the first phalange of any toe shall be considered equal to the loss of one-half of the toe and compensation shall be one-half of the amount for one toe.

11. The loss of more than one phalange shall be considered as the loss of the entire toe.

12. For the loss of a major hand, fifty months, or of a minor hand, forty months.

13. For the loss of a major arm, sixty months, or of a minor arm, fifty months.

14. For the loss of a foot, forty months.

15. For the loss of a leg, fifty months.

16. For the loss of an eye by enucleation, thirty months.

17. For the permanent and complete loss of sight in one eye without enucleation, twenty-five months.

18. For permanent and complete loss of hearing in one ear, twenty months.

19. For permanent and complete loss of hearing in both ears, sixty months.

20. The permanent and complete loss of the use of a finger, toe, arm, hand, foot or leg may be deemed the same as the loss of any such member by separation.

21. For the partial loss of use of a finger, toe, arm, hand, foot or leg, or partial loss of sight or hearing, fifty percent of the average monthly wage during that proportion of the number of months in the foregoing schedule provided for the complete loss of use of such member, or complete loss of sight or hearing, which the partial loss of use thereof bears to the total loss of use of such member or total loss of sight or hearing. For the purposes of this paragraph, "loss of use" means a loss of physical function of the affected member, sight or hearing. The effect on an employee's ability to return to the employee's occupation at the time of the injury shall not be considered in establishing the percentage of loss under this section, except that if the employee is unable to return to the work the employee was performing at the time the employee was injured due to the total or partial loss of use, compensation pursuant to this section shall be calculated based on seventy-five percent of the average monthly wage.

22. For permanent disfigurement about the head or face, including injury to or loss of teeth, the commission, pursuant to section 23-1047, may allow such sum for compensation thereof as it deems just, in accordance with the proof submitted, for a period of not more than eighteen months.

C. In cases not enumerated in subsection B of this section, if the injury causes permanent partial disability for work, the employee shall receive during such disability compensation equal to fifty-five percent of the difference between the employee's average monthly wages before the accident and the amount that represents the employee's reduced monthly earning capacity resulting from the disability, but the payment shall not continue after the disability ends, or the death of the injured employee, and in case the partial disability begins after a period of total disability, the period of total disability shall be deducted from the total period of compensation.

D. In determining the amount that represents the reduced monthly earning capacity for the purposes of subsections A and C of this section, consideration shall be given, among other things, to any previous disability, the occupational history of the injured employee, the nature and extent of the physical disability, the type of work the injured employee is able to perform after the injury, any wages received for work performed after the injury and the age of the employee at the time of injury.  If the employee is unable to return to work or continue working in any employment after the injury due to the employee's termination from employment for reasons that are unrelated to the industrial injury, the commission may consider the wages that the employee could have earned from that employment as representative of the employee's earning capacity. A determination of earning capacity that is based on wages that could have been earned from previously terminated employment is subject to change under subsection F of this section and an employee retains the right to later establish that the employee's reduced earning capacity is related in whole or in part to the industrial injury.

E. In case there is a previous disability, as the loss of one eye, one hand, one foot or otherwise, the percentage of disability for a subsequent injury shall be determined by computing the percentage of the entire disability and deducting therefrom the percentage of the previous disability as it existed at the time of the subsequent injury.

F. For the purposes of subsection C of this section, the commission, in accordance with the provisions of section 23-1047 when the physical condition of the injured employee becomes stationary, shall determine the amount that represents the reduced monthly earning capacity and on such determination make an award of compensation that is subject to change in any of the following events:

1. On a showing of a change in the physical condition of the employee after such findings and award arising out of the injury resulting in the reduction or increase of the employee's earning capacity.

2. On a showing of a reduction in the earning capacity of the employee arising out of such injury where there is no change in the employee's physical condition, after the findings and award.

3. On a showing that the employee's earning capacity has increased after such findings and award.

G. The commission may adopt a schedule for rating loss of earning capacity and reasonable and proper rules to carry out this section. In all cases involving this section, except for cases under subsection B of this section, or in cases involving a request pursuant to section 23-1061, subsection J for disability compensation, if any issue is raised regarding whether the injured employee has suffered a loss of earning capacity because of an inability to obtain or retain suitable work, the following apply:

1. The employer or carrier may present evidence showing that the inability to obtain suitable work is due, in whole or in part, to economic or business conditions, or other factors unrelated to the industrial injury. The injured employee may present evidence showing that the inability to obtain suitable work is due, in whole or in part, to the industrial injury or limitations resulting from the injury. The administrative law judge shall consider all such evidence in determining whether and to what extent the injured employee has sustained any loss of earning capacity.

2. In cases involving loss of employment, the employer or carrier may present evidence showing that the injured employee was terminated from employment or has not obtained suitable work, or both, due, in whole or in part, to economic or business conditions, or other factors unrelated to the injury. The injured employee may present evidence showing that such termination or inability to obtain suitable work is due, in whole or in part, to the industrial injury or limitations resulting from the injury. The administrative law judge shall consider all such evidence in determining whether and to what extent the injured employee has sustained any loss or additional loss of earning capacity.

H. Any single injury or disability that is listed in subsection B of this section and that is not converted into an injury or disability compensated under subsection C of this section by operation of this section shall be treated as scheduled under subsection B of this section regardless of its actual effect on the injured employee's earning capacity.

 

#### Section 23-1045. Compensation for total disability; permanent total disability defined

A. For temporary total disability the following compensation shall be paid:

1. Compensation of sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average monthly wage shall be paid during the period of disability.

2. If there are persons dependent for support upon the employee, compensation shall be paid as provided in this section, with an additional allowance of twenty-five dollars per month for such dependents during the period of disability. The additional allowance shall not be based upon a per capita number of dependents but shall reflect a total monthly benefit increase of exactly twenty-five dollars.

B. For permanent total disability, compensation of sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average monthly wage shall be paid during the life of the injured person.

C. In the absence of proof to the contrary, disability shall be deemed total and permanent if caused by:

1. The total and permanent loss of sight of both eyes.

2. The loss by separation of both feet.

3. The loss by separation of both hands.

4. An injury to the spine resulting in permanent and complete paralysis of both legs or both arms, or one leg and one arm.

5. An injury to the skull resulting in incurable imbecility or insanity.

6. The loss by separation of one hand and one foot.

D. The enumeration in this section is not exclusive, and in all other cases permanent total disability shall be determined in accordance with the facts and in accordance with the provisions of section 23-1047.

#### Section 23-1046. Death benefits

A. In case of an injury causing death, the compensation therefor shall be known as a death benefit and shall be payable in the amount, for the period, and to and for the benefit of the following:

1. Burial expenses, not to exceed five thousand dollars, in addition to the compensation.

2. To the surviving spouse, if there are no children, sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average monthly wage of the deceased, to be paid until such spouse's death or remarriage, with two years' compensation in one sum upon remarriage. To the surviving spouse if there are surviving children, thirty-five per cent of the average monthly wage of the deceased, to be paid until such spouse's death or remarriage with two years' compensation in one sum upon remarriage, and to the surviving children, an additional thirty-one and two-thirds per cent of the average monthly wage, to be divided equally among them until the age of eighteen years, until the age of twenty-two years if the child is enrolled as a full-time student in any accredited educational institution, or if over eighteen years and incapable of self-support when the child becomes capable of self-support. When all surviving children are no longer eligible for benefits, the surviving spouse's benefits shall be paid as if there were no children. In the event of the subsequent death or remarriage of the surviving spouse, the surviving child's or children's benefits shall be computed pursuant to paragraph 3.

3. To a single surviving child, in the case of the subsequent death or remarriage of a surviving husband or wife, or if there is no surviving husband or wife, sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of the average monthly wage of the deceased, or if there is more than one surviving child, sixty-six and two-thirds per cent to be divided equally among the surviving children. Compensation to any such child shall cease upon death, upon marriage or upon reaching the age of eighteen years, except, if over eighteen years and incapable of self-support, when he becomes capable of self-support, or if over eighteen years of age and enrolled as a full-time student in any accredited educational institution, when the child reaches age twenty-two.

4. To a parent, if there is no surviving husband, wife or child under the age of eighteen years, if wholly dependent for support upon the deceased employee at the time of his death, twenty-five per cent of the average monthly wage of the deceased during dependency, with an added allowance of fifteen per cent if two dependent parents survive, and, if neither parent is wholly dependent, but one or both partly dependent, fifteen per cent divided between them share and share alike.

5. To brothers or sisters under the age of eighteen years, if there is no surviving husband or wife, dependent children under the age of eighteen years or dependent parent, the following shall govern:

(a) If one of the brothers or sisters is wholly dependent upon the deceased employee for support at the time of injury causing death, twenty-five per cent of the average monthly wage until the age of eighteen years.

(b) If more than one brother or sister is wholly dependent, thirty-five per cent of the average monthly wage at the time of injury causing death, divided among such dependents share and share alike.

(c) If none of the brothers or sisters is wholly dependent, but one or more are partly dependent, fifteen per cent divided among such dependents share and share alike.

B. If the deceased employee leaves dependents only partially dependent upon his earnings for support at the time of the injury, the monthly compensation shall be equal to such proportion of the monthly payments for the benefit of persons totally dependent as the amount contributed by the employee to such partial dependents bears to the average wage of the deceased at the time of the injury resulting in his death. The duration of compensation to partial dependents shall be fixed by the commission in accordance with the facts shown, and in accordance with the provisions of section 23-1047, but shall in no case exceed compensation for one hundred months.

C. In the event of death of a dependent before expiration of the time named in the award, the funeral expenses of such person, not to exceed eight hundred dollars, shall be paid.

 

#### Section 23-1047. Procedure for determining compensation for partial disability and permanent total disability in cases not enumerated; procedure for determining nonscheduled dependency and duration of compensation to partial dependents in death cases

A. In cases of permanent partial disability under section 23-1044, subsection B, paragraph 22 and subsections C and F, when the physical condition of the injured employee becomes stationary, or in the case of permanent total disability not enumerated in section 23-1045, and under section 23-1045, subsection D, or in death cases under section 23-1046, subsection B, the employer or insurance carrier within thirty days shall notify the commission and request that the claim be examined and further compensation, if any, be determined. A copy of all medical reports necessary to make such determination also shall be furnished to the commission.  The employer or insurance carrier may commence payment of a permanent disability award without waiting for a determination under subsection B of this section.

B. Within thirty days after the commission receives the medical reports, the claims shall be examined and further compensation, including a permanent disability award, if any, shall be determined under the commission's supervision. If necessary, the commission may require additional medical or other information with respect to the claim and may postpone the determination for not more than sixty additional days. Any determination under this subsection may include necessary adjustments in any compensation paid or payable.

C. The commission shall serve a copy of the determination to all interested parties. Any such party may request a hearing under section 23-941 on the determination made under subsection B of this section within ninety days after copies of the determination are served.

D. Any person receiving permanent compensation benefits shall report annually on the anniversary date of the award to the self-insured employer or insurance carrier all of the person's earnings for the prior twelve-month period. If the person fails to make such report, the self-insured employer or insurance carrier shall notify the person that such report has not been received and that payment of further benefits will be suspended unless such report of earnings is filed within thirty days.  After thirty days have elapsed from the date of such notice, the self-insured employer or insurance carrier may issue a notice to the person suspending payment of further benefits and no further payments need be made until such report of earnings is filed.

E. Any person receiving permanent compensation benefits from the special fund established by section 23-1065 shall report annually on the anniversary date of the award to the commission all of the person's earnings for the prior twelve-month period.  If the person fails to make such report, the commission shall notify the person that such report has not been received and that payment of further benefits will be suspended unless such report of earnings is filed within thirty days.  After thirty days have elapsed from the date of such notice, the commission may issue a notice to the person suspending payment of further benefits and no further payments need be made until such report of earnings is filed.

#### Section 23-1048. Reasonable accommodations; earning capacity determination; definitions

### Article 9 - Payment of Compensation

#### Section 23-1061. Notice of accident; form of notice; claim for compensation; reopening; payment of compensation; notification of injury

A. Notwithstanding section 23-908, subsection E, no claim for compensation shall be valid or enforceable unless the claim is filed with the commission by the employee, or if resulting in death by the parties entitled to compensation, or someone on their behalf, in writing within one year after the injury occurred or the right thereto accrued.  The time for filing a compensation claim begins to run when the injury becomes manifest or when the claimant knows or in the exercise of reasonable diligence should know that the claimant has sustained a compensable injury. Except as provided in subsection B or N of this section, neither the commission nor any court shall have jurisdiction to consider a claim that is not timely filed under this subsection, except if the employee or other party entitled to file the claim has delayed in doing so because of justifiable reliance on a material representation by the commission, employer or insurance carrier or if the employee or other party entitled to file the claim is insane or legally incompetent or incapacitated at the time the injury occurs or the right to compensation accrues or during the one-year period thereafter. If the insanity or legal incompetence or incapacity occurs after the one-year period has commenced, the running of the remainder of the one-year period shall be suspended during the period of insanity or legal incompetence or incapacity. If the employee or other party is insane or legally incompetent or incapacitated when the injury occurs or the right to compensation accrues, the one-year period commences to run immediately on the termination of insanity or legal incompetence or incapacity. The commission on receiving a claim shall give notice to the insurance carrier.

B. Failure of an employee or any other party entitled to compensation to file a claim with the commission within one year or to comply with section 23-908 shall not bar a claim if the insurance carrier or employer has commenced payment of compensation benefits under section 23-1044, 23-1045 or 23-1046, except that the payments provided for by section 23-1046, subsection A, paragraph 1 and section 23-1065, subsection A shall not be considered compensation benefits for the purposes of this section.

C. If the commission receives a notification of the injury, the commission shall send a claim form to the employee.

D. The issue of failure to file a claim must be raised at the first hearing on a claim for compensation in respect to the injury or death.

E. Within ten days after receiving notice of an accident, the employer shall inform the employer's insurance carrier and the commission on such forms as may be prescribed by the commission.

F. Each insurance carrier and self-insuring employer shall report to the commission a notice of the first payment of compensation and shall serve on the commission and the employee any denial of a claim, any change in the amount of compensation and the termination of compensation, except that claims for medical, surgical and hospital benefits that are not denied shall be reported to the commission in the form and manner determined by the commission.  In all cases where compensation is payable, the insurance carrier or self-insuring employer shall promptly determine the average monthly wage pursuant to section 23-1041. Within thirty days after the payment of the first installment of compensation, the insurance carrier or self-insuring employer shall notify the employee and commission of the average monthly wage of the claimant as calculated, and the basis for such determination. The commission shall then make its own independent determination of the average monthly wage pursuant to section 23-1041. The commission, within thirty days after receipt of such notice, shall notify the employee, employer and insurance carrier of such determination. The amount determined by the commission shall be payable retroactive to the first date of entitlement. The first payment of compensation shall be accompanied by a notice on a form prescribed by the commission stating the manner in which the amount of compensation was determined.

G. Except as otherwise provided by law, the insurance carrier or self-insuring employer shall process and pay compensation and provide medical, surgical and hospital benefits, without the necessity for the making of an award or determination by the commission.

H. On a claim that has been previously accepted, an employee may reopen the claim to secure an increase or rearrangement of compensation or additional benefits by filing with the commission a petition requesting the reopening of the employee's claim on the basis of a new, additional or previously undiscovered temporary or permanent condition, which petition shall be accompanied by a statement from a physician setting forth the physical condition of the employee relating to the claim. A claim shall not be reopened if the initial claim for compensation was previously denied by a notice of claim status or determination by the commission and the notice or determination was allowed to become final and no exception applies under section 23-947 excusing a late filing to request a hearing. A claim shall not be reopened because of increased subjective pain if the pain is not accompanied by a change in objective physical findings. A claim shall not be reopened solely for additional diagnostic or investigative medical tests, but expenses for any reasonable and necessary diagnostic or investigative tests that are causally related to the injury shall be paid by the employer or the employer's insurance carrier. Expenses for reasonable and necessary medical and hospital care and laboratory work shall be paid by the employer or the employer's insurance carrier if the claim is reopened as provided by law and if these expenses are incurred within fifteen days before the date that the petition to reopen is filed. The payment for such reasonable and necessary medical, hospital and laboratory work expense shall be paid for by the employer or the employer's insurance carrier if the claim is reopened as provided by law and if such expenses are incurred within fifteen days before the filing of the petition to reopen. Surgical benefits are not payable for any period before the date of filing a petition to reopen, except that surgical benefits are payable for a period before the date of filing the petition to reopen not to exceed seven days if a bona fide medical emergency precludes the employee from filing a petition to reopen before the surgery.  No monetary compensation is payable for any period before the date of filing the petition to reopen.

I. On the filing of a petition to reopen a claim, the commission shall in writing notify the employer's insurance carrier or the self-insuring employer, which shall in writing notify the commission and the employee within twenty-one days after the date of such notice of its acceptance or denial of the petition. The reopened claim shall be processed thereafter in like manner as a new claim.

J. The commission shall investigate and review any claim in which it appears to the commission that the claimant has not been granted the benefits to which such claimant is entitled.  If the commission determines that payment or denial of compensation is improper in any way, it shall hold a hearing pursuant to section 23-941 within sixty days after receiving notice of such impropriety. Any claim for temporary partial disability benefits under this subsection must be filed with the commission within two years after the date the claimed entitlement to compensation accrued or within two years after the date on which an award for benefits encompassing the entitlement period becomes final.  A claim for temporary partial disability compensation shall be deemed to accrue when the employee knew or with the exercise of reasonable diligence should have known that the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or special fund denied or improperly paid compensation. A claim for temporary partial disability benefits shall not be deemed to have accrued any earlier than September 26, 2008.

K. When there is a dispute as to which employer or insurance carrier is liable for the payment of a compensable claim, the commission, by order, may designate the employer or insurance carrier that shall pay the claim. Payment shall begin within fourteen days after the employer or insurance carrier has been ordered by the commission to commence payment. When a final determination has been made as to which employer or insurance carrier is actually liable, the commission shall direct any necessary monetary adjustment or reimbursement among the parties or insurance carriers involved.

L. On application to the commission and for good cause shown, the commission may direct that a document filed as a claim for compensation benefits be designated as a petition to reopen, effective as of the original date of filing.  In like manner on application and good cause shown, the commission may direct that a document filed as a petition to reopen be designated as a claim for compensation benefits, effective as of the original date of filing.

M. If the insurance carrier or self-insurer does not issue a notice of claim status denying the claim within twenty-one days after the date the insurance carrier is notified by the commission of a claim or of a petition to reopen, the insurance carrier shall pay immediately compensation as if the claim were accepted, from the date the insurance carrier is notified by the commission of a claim or petition to reopen until the date on which the insurance carrier issues a notice of claim status denying such claim.  Compensation includes medical, surgical and hospital benefits. This section shall not apply to cases involving seven days or less of time lost from work.

N. If an insurance carrier or self-insured employer receives written notification of an injury from an employee who was injured and intends to file a claim for compensation, the insurance carrier or self-insured employer must forward the written notification of the injury and intended claim for compensation to the commission within seven business days and inform the employee of the employee's requirement to file a claim with the commission.  The one-year period as prescribed in subsection A of this section is suspended from the date the insurance carrier or self-insured employer received written notification of the injury and intended claim for compensation until the date that the insurance carrier or self-insured employer forwards the written notification to the commission.

B. Medical, surgical and hospital benefits include translation services, if needed.  A carrier, self-insurance pool or employer that does not direct care pursuant to section 23-1070 may choose the translator if the translator is certified by an outside agency and is not an employee of the carrier, self-insurance pool or employer. If the carrier, self-insurance pool or employer is unable to locate a certified translator for the particular language or dialect needed, the parties may agree on a translator who is not a certified translator.

D. The first installment of compensation is to be paid no later than the twenty-first day after written notification by the commission to the carrier of the filing of a claim unless the right to compensation is denied. Thereafter, compensation shall be paid at least once each two weeks during the period of temporary total disability and at least monthly thereafter. Compensation shall not be paid for the first seven days after the injury. If the incapacity extends beyond the period of seven days, compensation shall begin on the eighth day after the injury, but if the disability continues for one week beyond such seven days, compensation shall be computed from the date of the injury.

E. Compensation shall be made by negotiable instrument, payable immediately on demand or, at the election of the employee and if offered by the employer or carrier, by another commonly accepted method for transferring money by banking institutions, including electronic fund transfers to the employee's account or a prepaid debit card account that is established for the purpose of making direct electronic payment to the employee.

If a change of physician is ordered and the order becomes final, the employee shall select a physician who agrees to comply with this section. If other medical providers are not available in the employee's area of residence, the employer, carrier or commission shall pay in advance for the employee's reasonable travel expenses, including the cost of transportation, food, lodging and loss of pay, if applicable.

G. If medically necessary, the carrier, self-insured employer or commission shall provide drug rehabilitation and detoxification treatment for an employee who becomes dependent on or addicted to opioids that are prescribed for a work-related injury.

B. Questions of dependency and the extent thereof shall be determined as of the date of the injury to the employee and the dependent's right to any death benefit shall become fixed as of such time irrespective of any subsequent change in conditions, and the death benefits shall be directly recoverable by and payable to the dependent entitled thereto.

#### Section 23-1065. Special fund; purposes; investment committee

A. The industrial commission may direct the payment into the state treasury of not to exceed one per cent of all premiums received by private insurance carriers during the immediately preceding calendar year. The same percentage shall be assessed against self-insurers based on the total cost to the self-insured employer as provided in section 23-961, subsection G. Such assessments shall be computed on the same premium basis as provided for in section 23-961, subsections G, H, I, J and K and shall be no more than is necessary to keep the special fund actuarially sound. Such payments shall be placed in a special fund within the administrative fund to provide, at the discretion of the commission, such additional awards as may be necessary to enable injured employees to accept the benefits of any law of this state or of the United States, or both jointly, for promotion of vocational rehabilitation of persons with disabilities in industry.

B. In claims involving an employee who has a preexisting industrially-related permanent physical impairment of the type specified in section 23-1044, subsection B and who thereafter suffers an additional permanent physical impairment of the type specified in such subsection, the claim involving the subsequent impairment is eligible for reimbursement, as provided by subsection D of this section, according to the following:

1. The employer in whose employ the subsequent impairment occurred or its insurance carrier is solely responsible for all temporary disability compensation to which the employee is entitled and for an amount equal to the permanent disability compensation provided by section 23-1044, subsection B for the subsequent impairment. If the employee is determined to have sustained no loss of earning capacity after the medically stationary date, the employer or carrier shall pay him as a vocational rehabilitation bonus the amount calculated under this paragraph as a lump sum, which shall be a credit against any permanent compensation benefits awarded in any subsequent proceeding.  The amount of the vocational rehabilitation bonus for which the employer or carrier is responsible under this paragraph shall be calculated solely on physical, medically rated permanent impairment and not on occupational or other factors.

2. If the commission determines that the employee is entitled to compensation for loss of earning capacity under section 23-1044, subsection C or permanent total disability under section 23-1045, subsection B, the total amount of permanent benefits for which the employer or carrier is solely responsible under paragraph 1 of this subsection shall be expended first, with monthly payments made according to the loss of earning capacity or permanent total disability award. The employer or carrier and the special fund are equally responsible for the remaining amount of compensation for loss of earning capacity under section 23-1044, subsection C or permanent total disability under section 23-1045, subsection B.  This paragraph shall not be construed as requiring payment of any benefits under section 23-1044, subsection B in any case in which an employee is entitled to benefits for loss of earning capacity under section 23-1044, subsection C or permanent total disability benefits under section 23-1045, subsection B.

C. In claims involving an employee who has a preexisting physical impairment that is not industrially-related and, whether congenital or due to injury or disease, is of such seriousness as to constitute a hindrance or obstacle to employment or to obtaining reemployment if the employee becomes unemployed, and the impairment equals or exceeds a ten per cent permanent impairment evaluated in accordance with the American medical association guides to the evaluation of permanent impairment, and the employee thereafter suffers an additional permanent impairment not of the type specified in section 23-1044, subsection B, the claim involving the subsequent impairment is eligible for reimbursement, as provided by subsection D of this section, under the following conditions:

1. The employer in whose employ the subsequent impairment occurred or its carrier is solely responsible for all temporary disability compensation to which the employee is entitled.

2. The employer had knowledge of the permanent impairment at the time the employee was hired, or that the employee continued in employment after the employer acquired such knowledge.

3. The employee's preexisting impairment is due to one or more of the following:

(a) Epilepsy.

(b) Diabetes.

(c) Cardiac disease.

(d) Arthritis.

(e) Amputated foot, leg, arm or hand.

(f) Loss of sight of one or both eyes or a partial loss of uncorrected vision of more than seventy-five per cent bilaterally.

(g) Residual disability from poliomyelitis.

(h) Cerebral palsy.

(i) Multiple sclerosis.

(j) Parkinson's disease.

(k) Cerebral vascular accident.

(l) Tuberculosis.

(m) Silicosis.

(n) Psychoneurotic disability following treatment in a recognized medical or mental institution.

(o) Hemophilia.

(p) Chronic osteomyelitis.

(q) Hyperinsulinism.

(r) Muscular dystrophies.

(s) Arteriosclerosis.

(t) Thrombophlebitis.

(u) Varicose veins.

(v) Heavy metal poisoning.

(w) Ionizing radiation injury.

(x) Compressed air sequelae.

(y) Ruptured intervertebral disk.

4. The employer or carrier and the special fund are equally responsible for the amount of compensation for loss of earning capacity under section 23-1044, subsection C or permanent total disability under section 23-1045, subsection B.

D. The employer or insurance carrier shall notify the commission of its intent to claim reimbursement for an eligible claim under subsection B or C of this section not later than the time the employer or insurance carrier notifies the commission pursuant to section 23-1047, subsection A. Upon receiving notice the commission may expend funds from the special fund created by this section for travel and discovery procedures and for the employment of such independent legal, medical, rehabilitation, claims or labor market consultants or experts as may be deemed necessary by the commission to assist in the determination of the liability of the special fund, if any, under subsection B or C of this section. In the event there is any dispute regarding liability to the special fund pursuant to subsection B or C of this section, the commission shall not delay the issuance of a permanent award pursuant to section 23-1047, subsection B.

E. If the special fund created by this section is determined to be liable under either subsection B or C of this section, the employer or insurance carrier that is primarily liable shall pay the entire amount of the award to the injured employee and the commission shall by rule provide for the reimbursement of the employer or insurance carrier on an annual basis.  In any case arising out of subsection B or C of this section, the written approval of the special fund is required for the compromise of any claim made pursuant to section 23-1023. In any such case, written approval shall not be unreasonably withheld by the special fund, carrier, self-insured employer or other person responsible for the payment of compensation.  Failure to obtain the written approval of the special fund shall not cause the injured worker to lose any benefits but ends the special fund's liability for reimbursement and makes the employer or carrier solely responsible for the payment of the remaining benefits.

F. The employer or insurance carrier shall make its claim for reimbursement to the commission no later than November 1 each year, for payments made pursuant to subsection B or C of this section during the twelve months prior to October 1 each year. Claims shall be paid before December 31 each year. If the total annual reserved liabilities of the special fund obligated under subsections B and C of this section exceed six million dollars, as determined by the annual actuarial study performed pursuant to subsection I of this section, the commission, after notice and a hearing, may levy an additional assessment under subsection A of this section of up to one-half per cent to meet such liabilities. Any insurance carrier or employer who may be adversely affected by the additional assessment may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such additional assessment is ordered file a complaint challenging the validity of the additional assessment in the superior court in Maricopa county for a judicial review of the additional assessment. On judicial review the determination of the commission shall be upheld if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.

G. In the event the injured employee is awarded additional compensation, under subsection A of this section, the commission retains jurisdiction to amend, alter or change the award upon a change in the physical condition of the injured employee resulting from the injury.

H. On receiving notice that the special fund may be liable under this chapter, the commission may spend monies from the special fund established by this section for expenses that are necessary to assist in the processing, payment or determination of liability of the fund. These expenses may include travel, discovery procedures and employing any legal, medical, rehabilitation, claims or labor market consultant, examiner or expert.

I. The commission shall cause an annual actuarial study of the special award fund to be made by a qualified actuary who is a member of the society of actuaries. The actuary shall make specific recommendations for maintaining the fund on a sound actuarial basis.  The actuarial study shall be completed on or before September 1.

J. The special fund of the commission consists of all monies from premiums and assessments, except penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter, received and paid into the fund, property and securities acquired by the use of monies in the fund, interest earned on monies in the fund and other monies derived from the sale, use or lease of properties belonging to the fund. The special fund created by this section shall be administered by the director of the industrial commission, subject to the authority of the industrial commission.  The director of the commission with approval of the investment committee, in the administration of the special fund, may provide loans, subject to repayment, budgetary review and legislative appropriation, to the administrative fund for the purposes and subject to section 23-1081, acquire real property and acquire or construct a building or other improvements on the real property as may be necessary to house, contain, furnish, equip and maintain offices and space for departmental and operational facilities of the commission. The commission when using space constructed pursuant to this section shall make equal payments of rent on a semiannual basis, which shall be deposited in the special fund. The investment committee shall determine the amount of the rent, which must be at least equal to or greater than that determined by the joint committee on capital review for buildings of similar design and construction as provided by section 41-792.01.

K. There is established an investment committee consisting of the director and the chairman of the commission and three persons knowledgeable in investments and economics appointed by the governor. Of the members appointed by the governor, one shall be a professional in the investment business, one shall represent workers' compensation insurers and one shall represent self-insurers. The term of members appointed by the governor is three years, which shall begin on July 1 and end on June 30 three years later. The committee shall prescribe by rule investment policies and supervise the investment activities of the special fund.

L. Each member of the investment committee, other than the director of the commission, is eligible to receive from the special fund:

1. Compensation of fifty dollars for each day while in actual attendance at meetings of the investment committee.

2. Reimbursement for expenses pursuant to title 38, chapter 4, article 2.

M. The investment committee shall meet at least once every month.

N. The investment committee shall periodically review and assess the investment strategy.

O. The investment committee, by resolution, may invest and reinvest the surplus or reserves in the funds established under this chapter in any legal investments authorized under section 38-718.

P. In addition to the investments authorized under section 38-718, the investment committee may approve the investment in real property and improvements on real property to house and maintain offices of the commission, including spaces for its departmental and operational facilities. Title to the real estate and improvements on the real estate vests in the special fund of the commission, and the assets become part of the fund as provided by this section.

Q. The investment committee may appoint a custodian for the safekeeping of all or any portion of the investments owned by the special fund of the commission and may register stocks, bonds and other investments in the name of a nominee.  Except for investments held by a custodian or in the name of a nominee, all securities purchased pursuant to subsection O of this section shall promptly be deposited with the state treasurer as custodian thereof, who shall collect the dividends, interest and principal thereof, and pay, when collected, into the special fund. The state treasurer shall pay all vouchers drawn for the purchase of securities. The director may sell any of the securities as the director deems appropriate, if authorized by resolution of the investment committee, and the proceeds therefrom shall be payable to the state treasurer for the account of the special fund upon delivery of the securities to the purchaser or the purchaser's agent.

2. If medical, wage loss or disability benefits are paid or otherwise provided by an employer to or for the benefit of an employee for an injury or illness for which medical or compensation benefits payable pursuant to this article have been denied or for which a claim for compensation under this article has not been filed, and the injury or illness is subsequently determined to be compensable under this article, the employer or the person authorized by the employer to provide such benefits is entitled to a direct payment out of, or a direct credit against, the medical or compensation benefits payable under this article in the amount of the benefits previously paid or provided.

Unless the director decides to use another method, the rates used to determine the premiums of risks in the assigned risk plan are the rates annually filed with the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions by the designated rating organization pursuant to section 20-357, subsection B, unless the director requires the use of rates from another rating organization, plus a uniform percentage increase that applies to all classifications, that is determined by the designated rating organization or, if the director directs, another rating organization and that is subject to approval by the director. The expected loss rates, ballast factors and other factors for use with the uniform experience rating plan as described in title 20, chapter 2, article 4 and filed with the director also apply to experience rated risks in the assigned risk plan.

F. Rating classifications used in the assigned risk plan shall conform to the uniform classification plan.  Subclassifications and rating rule deviations shall not be used in the assigned risk plan.

G. All insurers participating in workers' compensation or occupational disease compensation insurance shall participate in the assigned risk plan.

I. An insurer that refuses to participate in the assigned risk plan shall not be authorized to write workers' compensation coverage in this state. If an insurer refuses to participate in the assigned risk plan after being authorized to write workers' compensation coverage in this state, the insurer's authorization shall be revoked.

### Article 5 - Agricultural Employment Relations

#### Section 23-1381. Declaration of policy

It is hereby declared to be the policy of this state that the uninterrupted production, packing, processing, transporting and marketing of agricultural products are vital to the public interest. It is also declared to be the policy of this state that agricultural employees are free to organize, to take concerted action and, through representatives of their own choosing, to enter into collective bargaining contracts establishing their wages and terms and conditions of employment or to refrain from engaging in any or all of these activities. It is further declared that there now exists an inequality of bargaining power between agricultural employers and labor unions, arising out of the seasonal character and perishable nature of such agricultural products, the mobility of agricultural labor and the fundamental differences between agriculture and industry. While the right to strike is a basic right of organized labor, such right must take into account the perishable character and the seasonal nature of agricultural products and must be limited and regulated accordingly. It is the intent of the legislature to provide a means to bargain collectively that is fair and equitable to agricultural employers, labor organizations and employees, to provide orderly election procedures to resolve questions concerning representation of agricultural employees and to declare that certain acts are unfair labor practices that are prohibited and that are subject to control by the police power of this state. The overriding special interest of this state with respect to certain secondary boycott activities originating in this state, but extending across state lines and directed at employers in other states, must be recognized, and such acts must be made unlawful and subject to control by the police power of this state.

B. Agricultural employees also have those rights more particularly defined and described in articles 1 and 3 of this chapter and shall be protected from the practices described in article 4 of this chapter.

#### Section 23-1384. Rights of employer

An agricultural employer has the following management rights:

1. To manage, control and conduct his operations, including but not limited to the number of farms and their locations, methods of carrying on any operation or practices, kinds of crops, time of work, size and makeup of crews, assignment of work and places of work.

2. To hire, suspend, discharge or transfer employees in accordance with his judgment of their ability.

3. To determine the type of equipment or machinery to be used, the standards and quality of work, and the wages, hours and conditions of work.

4. To work on his own farm in any capacity at any time.

5. To join or refuse to join any labor organization or employer organization.

#### Section 23-1385. Unfair labor practices; definition

A. It is an unfair labor practice for an agricultural employer:

1. To interfere with, restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 23-1383 and articles 1 and 3 of this chapter or to violate the protection of employees from the practices described in article 4 of this chapter.

2. To dominate or interfere with the formation or administration of any labor organization or contribute financial or other support to it. An agricultural employer shall not be prohibited from permitting employees to confer with him during working hours without loss of time or pay.

3. To encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization by discrimination in regard to hiring or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment.

4. To discharge or otherwise discriminate against an agricultural employee because he has filed charges or given testimony under this article.

5. To refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees, subject to section 23-1389. Nothing in this article shall be construed as requiring an agricultural employer to bargain collectively until a representative of his agricultural employees has been determined by means of a valid secret ballot election.

6. To discharge or otherwise discriminate against any person because he has filed charges or given testimony before the board or a court.

7. To threaten to have discharged any agricultural employee, or threaten to have wages of any agricultural employees reduced, solely because of any labor activity.

B. It is an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or its agents to:

1. Impose any economic sanction, to restrain or coerce agricultural employees in the exercise of their rights or to coerce or intimidate any employee in the enjoyment of his legal rights provided by this article, or to intimidate his family, picket his domicile or injure the person or property of any employee or his family. This paragraph does not impair the right of a labor organization to prescribe its own rules with respect to the acquisition or retention of membership.

2. Threaten or impose any economic sanction or reprisal against any person who is not a member of the labor organization in the exercise of rights under this article, including but not limited to the right to refrain from any or all concerted activity, or against any person, who is not a member of the labor organization, who refrains from compliance with a union rule, policy or practice that establishes or affects wages, hours or working conditions at such person's place of employment.

3. Restrain, coerce, or threaten or impose any fine or other economic sanction against any person who invokes the processes of the board, or the court, or against an agricultural employer or employee in the selection of his representatives for the purposes of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.

4. Refuse to bargain collectively with an agricultural employer, provided it is the majority representative of his agricultural employees as determined pursuant to section 23-1389.

5. Cause or attempt to cause an agricultural employer to:

(a) Pay or deliver or agree to pay or deliver any money or other thing of value for services that are not performed or that are not to be performed.

(b) Establish or alter the number of employees to be employed or the assignment of the employees.

(c) Assign work to the employees of a particular employer.

(d) Discriminate in regard to hiring or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization. Nothing in this subdivision prohibits agreements between labor organizations and agricultural employers that regulate hiring and tenure of employment on the basis of seniority, and the labor organization is not given power to determine seniority unilaterally.

6. Engage in a secondary boycott as defined in section 23-1321.

7. Induce or encourage or threaten, restrain or coerce any secondary employer or any executive or management employee of any secondary employer to make a management decision not to handle, transport, process, pack, sell or distribute any agricultural commodity of an agricultural employer with whom a labor dispute exists.

8. Induce or encourage the ultimate consumer of any agricultural product to refrain from purchasing, consuming or using such agricultural product by the use of dishonest, untruthful and deceptive publicity. Permissible inducement or encouragement within the meaning of this section means truthful, honest and nondeceptive publicity that identifies the agricultural product produced by an agricultural employer with whom the labor organization has a primary dispute. Permissible inducement or encouragement does not include publicity directed against any trademark, trade name or generic name that may include agricultural products of another producer or user of such trademark, trade name or generic name.

9. Restrain, coerce or threaten an ultimate consumer to prevent him from purchasing, consuming or using such agricultural product.

10. Threaten or engage in arson, libel, slander, injury to person or property or other violent conduct if the objective is to prevent the preparing for market, transporting, handling, displaying for sale, or selling of any agricultural product.

11. Intimidate, restrain or coerce agricultural employers in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by section 23-1384.

12. Picket or cause to be picketed, boycott or cause to be boycotted, or threaten to boycott or picket, or cause to be boycotted or picketed, any agricultural employer if the objective is to induce, encourage, force or require an agricultural employer to recognize or bargain with a labor organization as the representative of his agricultural employees, or the agricultural employees of an agricultural employer to accept or select such labor organization as their collective bargaining representative unless such labor organization is currently certified as the representative of such employees:

(a) If the agricultural employer has lawfully recognized in accordance with this article any other labor organization and a question concerning representation may not appropriately be raised under section 23-1389.

(b) If within the preceding twelve months a valid election under section 23-1389 has been conducted.

(c) If a petition has been filed under section 23-1389.

13. Call a strike unless a majority of the employees within the bargaining unit has first approved the calling of such a strike by secret ballot.

C. The expressing of any views, argument or opinion or the making of any statement, including expressions intended to influence the outcome of an organizing campaign, a bargaining controversy, a strike, lockout or other labor dispute, or the dissemination of such views whether in written, printed, graphic, visual or auditory form, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit, does not constitute or is not evidence of an unfair labor practice or does not constitute grounds for, or evidence justifying, setting aside the results of any election conducted under any of the provisions of this article. A statement of fact by either a labor organization or an agricultural employer relating to existing or proposed operations of the employer or to existing or proposed terms, tenure or conditions of employment with the employer shall not be considered to constitute a threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit. An employer shall not be required to furnish or make available to a labor organization, and no labor organization shall be required to furnish or make available to an employer, materials, information, time or facilities to enable such employer or labor organization, as the case may be, to communicate with employees of the employer, members of the labor organization, its supporters or its adherents.

D. For the purposes of this section, "bargain collectively" means the performance of the mutual obligation of the agricultural employer and the representative of the agricultural employees to meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment that directly affect the work of employees, or the negotiation of an agreement, or to resolve any question arising thereunder. Bargain collectively includes the furnishing of necessary and relevant information in connection with the negotiation of an agreement or any issue arising under such agreement, or requiring as a condition for entering into an agreement the execution of a written contract incorporating any agreement reached if requested by either party. The failure or refusal of either party to agree to a proposal, to the making, changing or withdrawing of a lawful proposal or to the making of a concession does not constitute, or is not evidence, direct or indirect, of, a breach of this obligation. The board in any remedial order shall not direct either party to make any concession, agree to any proposal or make any payment of money except to employees who are reinstated with back pay as provided in section 23-1390. This section does not require any agricultural employer to bargain collectively with respect to any management rights. "Management rights", as used in this subsection, includes but is not limited to the right to discontinue the entire farming operation or any part of the operation, to contract out any part of the work of the operation not covered by a labor contract, to sell or lease any of the real or personal property involved in the operation or to determine the methods, equipment and facilities to be used in producing agricultural products or the agricultural products to be produced.

E. If there is in effect a collective bargaining contract covering agricultural employees, the duty to bargain collectively also means that no party to the contract may terminate or modify the contract, unless the party desiring such termination or modification:

1. Serves a written notice on the other party to the contract of the proposed termination or modification not less than sixty days prior to the expiration date of the contract, or if such contract contains no expiration date, sixty days prior to the time it is proposed to make such termination or modification.

2. Offers to meet and confer with the other party for the purpose of negotiating a new contract or a contract containing the proposed modifications.

3. Continues the contract in full force and effect without resorting to a strike or lockout for a period of sixty days after such notice is given or until the expiration date of such contract, whichever occurs later.

F. The duties imposed on agricultural employers, agricultural employees and labor organizations become inapplicable on an intervening certification of the board, under which the labor organization or individual that is a party to the contract has been superseded as or ceased to be the representative of the employees subject to section 23-1389, and the duties so imposed shall not be construed as requiring either party to discuss or agree to any modification of the terms and conditions contained in a contract for a fixed period, if such modification is to become effective before such terms and conditions can be reopened under the provisions of the contract. Any agricultural employee who engages in a strike within the sixty day period specified in this subsection loses his status as an agricultural employee of the agricultural employer engaged in the particular labor dispute for the purposes of this section and sections 23-1389 and 23-1390, but such loss of status for such employee terminates when he is reemployed by such employer.

#### Section 23-1386. Agricultural employment relations board; members; terms; appointment

A. An agricultural employment relations board is established that consists of seven members.

B. The governor shall appoint the members of the board. Two of the members shall be appointed as representatives of agriculture employers, two of the members appointed shall be representatives of organized agricultural labor and the three additional members, one of whom shall be the chairman of the board, shall be appointed as representatives of the general public. The term of office of the members is five years. On the initial appointment, one of the labor representatives shall be appointed for a term of one year, one of the representatives of the general public shall be appointed for a term of one year, one of the agricultural representatives shall be appointed for a term of two years, one of the representatives of the general public shall be appointed for a term of two years, one of the agricultural representatives shall be appointed for a term of three years, one of the labor representatives shall be appointed for a term of four years, and one of the public members of the board shall be appointed for a term of five years.

C. The governor shall appoint two alternate members. One of the alternates shall be appointed as a representative of organized agricultural labor and the other as a representative of agriculture. Alternates shall be appointed for terms of five years. Any individual appointed to fill a vacancy of any alternate shall be appointed only for the unexpired portion of the term of the alternate he is succeeding. Alternates may be removed from office by the governor on notice and a hearing for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause. No alternate may participate in deliberations of the board except in the absence of a board member representing his area of interest.

D. The governor shall appoint a general counsel of the board. The general counsel is the exclusive legal representative of the board, has final authority, on behalf of the board, with respect to the investigation of charges and the issuance of complaints under section 23-1390 and with respect to the prosecution of such complaints by the board, and has such other duties as the board may prescribe or as may be provided by law. The general counsel shall appoint such assistants as needed to carry out the work of the office.

E. A vacancy on the board does not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board, and four members constitute a quorum of the board. The board shall have an official seal that is judicially recognized.

F. The principal office of the board shall be in the city of Phoenix, but it may meet and exercise any of its powers at any other place.

G. The board may meet in executive session on the decision of a majority of the members of the board.

H. Meetings of the board may be called by the chairman or by a majority of the members of the board by giving written notice to the chairman who shall notify all of the members of the board as to the time and place of the board meeting.

#### Section 23-1387. Powers and duties

A. By one or more of its members or by such agents or agencies as it may designate, the board may prosecute any inquiry necessary to its functions in any part of this state. A member of the board who participates in any such inquiry shall not be disqualified from subsequently participating in a decision of the board in the same case.

B. The board shall adopt rules pursuant to title 41, chapter 6 as may be necessary to carry out this article.

C. The board may also establish offices in such other cities as it deems necessary and shall determine the region to be served by such offices. The board may delegate to the heads of these offices as it deems appropriate its powers under section 23-1389 to determine the unit appropriate for the purpose of collective bargaining, to investigate and provide for hearings, to determine whether a question of representation exists and to direct an election by a secret ballot and to certify, within a reasonable period of time, the results of such election. The board may review any action taken pursuant to the authority delegated under this subsection by any regional officer on a request for a review of such action filed with the board by any interested party. Any such review made by the board, unless specifically ordered by the board, does not operate as a stay of any action taken by the regional officer. The entire record considered by the board in considering or acting on any such request or review shall be made available to all parties before the consideration or action, and the board's findings and action thereon shall be published as a decision of the board.

#### Section 23-1388. Officers and employees of the board

A. The board may appoint an executive secretary and such attorneys and other employees as it may from time to time find necessary for the proper performance of its duties. Compensation for all such personnel shall be as determined pursuant to section 38-611.

B. The board may not employ any attorney for the purpose of reviewing transcripts of hearings or preparing drafts of opinions, except that any attorney employed for assignment as a legal assistant to any board member may review such transcripts and prepare such drafts for the board member.

C. No administrative law judge's report may be reviewed, either before or after its publication, by any person other than a member of the board or his legal assistant, and no administrative law judge may advise or consult with the board with respect to exceptions taken to his findings, rulings or recommendations.

D. At the discretion of the board, attorneys appointed under this section may appear for and represent the board in any case in court.

#### Section 23-1389. Representatives and elections

A. Representatives selected by a secret ballot for the purposes of collective bargaining by the majority of the agricultural employees in a unit appropriate for such purposes are the exclusive representatives of all of the agricultural employees in such unit for the purpose of collective bargaining in respect to rates of pay, wages, hours of employment or other conditions of employment. If ratification of any such contract is required, the right to vote in such ratification is limited to the employees in the bargaining unit. Any individual agricultural employee or a group of agricultural employees at any time may present grievances to their agricultural employer and have such grievances adjusted, without the intervention of the bargaining representative, if the adjustment is not inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining contract or agreement then in effect. The bargaining representative may be present at such adjustment.

B. The board shall decide in each case whether in order to ensure to employees the fullest freedom in exercising their rights the unit appropriate for the purposes of collective bargaining shall consist of either all temporary agricultural employees or all permanent agricultural employees of an agricultural employer working at the farm where such employer grows or produces agricultural products, or both. In making unit determinations the extent of a union's extent of organization shall not be controlling. Principal factors should be the community of interest between employees, the same hours, duties and compensation, the administrative structure of the employer and the control of labor relations policies.

C. The board shall investigate any petition and, if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, shall provide for an appropriate hearing on due notice, if such petition has been filed in good faith in accordance with the rules that may be prescribed by the board:

1. By an agricultural employee or group of agricultural employees or any individual or labor organization acting in its behalf alleging that thirty per cent or more of the number of agricultural employees in the unit in question either wish to be represented for collective bargaining and that their employer declines to recognize their representative or assert that the individual or labor organization that has been certified or that is being currently recognized by their employer as the bargaining representative is no longer a representative.

2. By an agricultural employer, alleging that one or more individuals or labor organizations have presented to him a claim to be recognized as the representative or that an individual or labor organization that has previously been certified as the bargaining representative is no longer a representative.

D. If the board finds on the record of such hearing that a question of representation exists, it shall direct an election by secret ballot and shall certify the results. If a second labor organization files a petition for an election alleging that thirty per cent or more of the employees in the unit in question desire to be represented by that labor organization, the board shall require that the names of both labor organizations appear on the ballot. In any election the voters shall be afforded the choice of "no union". If in a representational election more than one union is on the ballot, and none of the choices receives a majority vote, a second election shall be held. The second election shall be between the union receiving the highest number of votes and "no union". In any election a labor organization shall obtain a majority of all votes cast in that election in order to be certified as the bargaining representative of all of the employees in that unit.

E. In determining whether or not a question of representation exists, the same rules of decision apply irrespective of the identity of the persons filing the petition or the kind of relief sought. In no case may the board deny a labor organization a place on the ballot by reason of an order with respect to such labor organization or its predecessor not issued in conformity with section 23-1390.

F. Within five days of receipt of such a petition, the agricultural employer may file a challenge to such petition on the ground that the authorization for the filing of such petition is not current or that such authorization has been obtained by fraud, misrepresentation or coercion. The petition shall not act to stay the election proceeding, but if it is thereafter determined that the authorizations are not current or are obtained by fraud, misrepresentation or coercion the petition will be dismissed.

G. No election may be directed or conducted in any bargaining unit or any subdivision of a bargaining unit within which, in the preceding twelve month period, a valid election has been held. Employees who are engaged in an economic strike and who are not entitled to reinstatement are eligible to vote under such rules as the board finds are consistent with the purposes and provisions of this article in any election conducted within three months after the commencement of the strike. Any agricultural employee who is found to have sought or accepted employment only for the purpose of affecting the outcome of an election is not eligible to vote in an election conducted pursuant to this article for a period of twelve months from the date of that election.

H. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the waiving of hearings by stipulation for the purpose of a consent election in conformity with rules or decisions of the board.

I. Within ten days after an election is directed by the board or a consent election agreement is approved by the board and on request of the board, the agricultural employer shall furnish to the board a list of agricultural employees in the bargaining unit who are qualified to vote, and this list shall be made available to the organizations or other interested employees involved in the election.

J. On the filing with the board, by thirty per cent or more of the agricultural employees in a bargaining unit covered by a certification or by an agreement between their employer and a labor organization made pursuant to section 23-1385, of a petition alleging the desire that such representation authority be rescinded, the board shall conduct an election by secret ballot of the employees in such unit and shall certify the results to the labor organization and the employer.

#### Section 23-1390. Prevention of unfair labor practices

A. The board, as provided in this section, may prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice.

B. If it is charged that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, the board, or any agent or agency designated by the board for such purposes, may issue and cause to be served on the person a complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice of hearing before the board or a member of the board or an administrative law judge at least five days after the serving of the complaint.  Hearings shall be conducted pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  No complaint may issue based on any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months before the filing of the charge with the board and the service of a copy of the complaint on the person against whom the charge is made, unless the person so aggrieved was prevented from filing the charge by reason of service in the armed forces, in which event the six month period shall be computed from the day of the person's discharge. Any such complaint may be amended by the member or administrative law judge conducting the hearing or the board in its discretion at any time before the issuance of an order based on the complaint.  The person so complained of may file an answer to the original or amended complaint, may appear in person or otherwise and may give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint.  In the discretion of the board or the member, agent or agency conducting the hearing, any other person may be allowed to intervene in the proceeding and to present testimony.

C. The testimony taken by the board or such member or administrative law judge shall be reduced to writing and filed with the board.  Thereafter, in its discretion, the board on notice may take further testimony or hear argument.  If on the preponderance of the testimony taken the board determines that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice, the board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the person an order requiring the person to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice and shall take such affirmative action, including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of this article. If an order directs reinstatement of an employee, back pay may be required of the employer or labor organization, as the case may be, responsible for the discrimination suffered by the employee.  The order may further require the person to make reports from time to time showing the extent to which the person has complied with the order.  If on the preponderance of the testimony taken the board determines that the person named in the complaint has not engaged in or is not engaging in any unfair labor practice, the board shall state its findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint.  No order of the board may require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged, or the payment to the individual of any back pay, if the individual was suspended or discharged for cause.  If the evidence is presented before a member of the board, or before an examiner or examiners of the board, the member, or the examiner or examiners, as the case may be, shall issue and cause to be served on the parties to the proceedings a proposed report, together with a recommended order, that shall be filed with the board, and if no exceptions are filed within ten days after service of the order on such parties, or within such further period as the board may authorize, such recommended order becomes the order of the board and is as prescribed in the order.

D. Until the record in a case is filed in a court, as provided in this section, the board at any time on reasonable notice and in a manner as it deems proper may modify or set aside, in whole or in part, any finding or order made or issued by it.

E. The board may petition the superior court in any county where the unfair labor practice in question occurred or where the person resides or transacts business for the enforcement of the order and for appropriate temporary relief or a restraining order.  On the filing of the petition the court shall cause notice to be served on the person, and thereupon has jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and may grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper and may make and enter a decree enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the board.

F. Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, final decisions of the board are subject to judicial review pursuant to title  12, chapter 7, article  6.

G. If an order of the board made pursuant to this section is based in whole or in part on facts certified following an investigation pursuant to section 23-1389 and there is a petition for the enforcement of the order, the certification and the record of such investigation shall be included in the transcript of the entire record required to be filed under subsection E of this section, and the decree of the court enforcing the order of the board shall be made and entered based on the pleadings, testimony and proceedings set forth in the transcript.  The court shall not enforce any order of the board that rests, in whole or in part, on evidence adduced from witnesses who have not testified under oath and who have not been subject to cross-examination by opposing parties.

H. Unless specifically ordered by the court, the commencement of proceedings under subsection E or F of this section does not operate as a stay of the board's order.

I. Petitions filed under this article shall be heard expeditiously, and if possible within ten days after they have been docketed.

J. On issuance of a complaint as provided in subsection B of this section charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, the board may petition the superior court in any county where the unfair labor practice in question is alleged to have occurred or where the person resides or transacts business for appropriate temporary relief or a restraining order.  On the filing of any such petition the court shall cause notice to be served on the person and thereupon has jurisdiction to grant to the board such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.

K. If it is charged that any person has engaged in an unfair labor practice, the preliminary investigation of the charge shall be made immediately and shall be given priority over all other cases except cases of like character in the office where it is filed or to which it is referred.  If, after such investigation, the officer to whom the matter may be referred has reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true and that a complaint should issue, the officer shall petition, on behalf of the board, the superior court in the county where the unfair labor practice in question has occurred or is alleged to have occurred, or where the person alleged to have committed the unfair labor practice resides or transacts business, for appropriate injunctive relief pending the final adjudication of the board with respect to the matter.  On the filing of any such petition the superior court has jurisdiction to grant any injunctive relief or temporary restraining order it deems just and proper, notwithstanding any other law, except that no temporary restraining order may be issued without notice unless a petition alleges that substantial and irreparable injury to the charging party will be unavoidable and the temporary restraining order is effective for no longer than five days and will become void at the expiration of such period.  On the filing of any such petition the court shall cause notice to be served on any person complained against in the charge and the person, including the charging party, shall be given an opportunity to appear in person or by counsel and present any relevant testimony.  For the purposes of this subsection, the superior court is deemed to have jurisdiction of a labor organization either in the county in which the organization maintains its principal office or in any county in which its duly authorized officers or agents are engaged in promoting or protecting the interests of employee members.  The service of legal process on an officer or agent constitutes service on the labor organization and makes the organization a party to the suit.

 

#### Section 23-1391. Investigatory powers

A. The board, or its duly authorized agent or agencies, shall have access to, at all reasonable times, for the purpose of examination, and the right to copy any evidence of any person being investigated or proceeded against that relates to any matter under investigation or in question. The board or any member of the board on application of any party to such proceedings forthwith shall issue to such party subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of any evidence in such proceeding or investigation requested in such application. Within five days after the service of a subpoena on any person requiring the production of any evidence in his possession or under his control, such person may petition the board to revoke, and the board shall revoke, the subpoena if in its opinion the evidence whose production is required does not relate to any matter under investigation, or any matter in question in such proceedings, or if in its opinion such subpoena does not describe with sufficient particularity the evidence whose production is required. Any member of the board, or any agent or agency designated by the board for such purposes, may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses and receive evidence. The attendance of witnesses and the production of the evidence may be required from any place in this state at any designated place of hearing.

B. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to any person, the superior court in the county within the jurisdiction of which the person guilty of contumacy or refusal to obey is found or resides or transacts business, on application by the board, has jurisdiction to issue to such person an order requiring the person to appear before the board, or a member, agent or agency of the board, to produce evidence if so ordered or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation or in question. Failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as contempt.

C. Complaints, orders and other process and papers of the board, or a member, agent or agency of the board, may be served either personally, by registered or certified mail, by telegraph or by leaving a copy at the principal office, place of business or residence of the person required to be served. The verified return by the individual personally serving or leaving the copy, setting forth the manner of the service, and the return post office receipt, if registered or certified, or telegraph receipt and mailed or telegraphed as provided in this subsection, are proof of service.

#### Section 23-1393. Court jurisdiction

A. Any person who is aggrieved or is injured in his business or property by reason of any violation of this article, or a violation of an injunction issued as provided in this section, may sue in the superior court in the county having jurisdiction of the parties for recovery of any damages resulting from the unlawful action, regardless of where such unlawful action occurred and regardless of where such damage occurred, including costs of the suit and reasonable attorney fees. On the filing of the suit the court also has jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief or a temporary restraining order as it deems just and proper. Petitions for injunctive relief or temporary restraining orders shall be heard expeditiously. Petitions for temporary restraining orders alleging a violation of section 23-1385 shall be heard forthwith and if the petition alleges that substantial and irreparable injury to the petitioner is unavoidable such temporary restraining orders may be issued pursuant to rule 65 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure.

B. In the case of a strike or boycott, or threat of a strike or boycott, against an agricultural employer, the court may grant, and on proper application shall grant as provided in this section, a ten day restraining order enjoining such a strike or boycott, provided that if an agricultural employer invokes the court's jurisdiction to issue the ten day restraining order to enjoin a strike as provided by this subsection, the employer as a condition must agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration as the means of settling the unresolved issues. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within two days after the court awards a restraining order, the court shall appoint one to decide the unresolved issues. Any agricultural employer is entitled to injunctive relief accorded by rule 65 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure on the filing of a verified petition showing that his agricultural employees are unlawfully on strike or are unlawfully conducting a boycott, or are unlawfully threatening to strike or boycott, and that the resulting cessation of work or conduct of a boycott will result in the prevention of production or the loss, spoilage, deterioration or reduction in grade, quality or marketability of an agricultural commodity or commodities for human consumption in commercial quantities. For the purpose of this subsection, an agricultural commodity or commodities for human consumption with a market value of five thousand dollars or more constitutes commercial quantities.

C. For the purpose of this article, the superior court has jurisdiction of a labor organization in this state if such organization maintains its principal office in this state, or if its duly authorized officers or agents are engaged in promoting or protecting the interests of agricultural employee members or in the solicitation of such prospective members in this state.

D. The service of any summons, subpoena or other legal process of the superior court on an officer or agent of a labor organization, in his capacity as such, constitutes service on the labor organization.

E. Any labor organization that represents employees as defined in this article, and any agricultural employer, are bound by the acts of its agents. Any such labor organization may sue or be sued as an entity and in behalf of the employees whom it represents in the courts of this state.

F. For the purposes of this article, in determining whether any person is acting as an agent of another person in order to make the other person responsible for his acts, the question of whether the specific acts performed were actually authorized or subsequently ratified is not controlling. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to preclude an agent being sued both in his capacity as an agent and as an individual.

#### Section 23-1394. Scope of article

This article applies only to such persons, labor organizations or activities as are not within the jurisdiction of the national labor relations act or the jurisdictional guidelines established by the national labor relations board.

The calculated damages are as follows:

1. For health, pension or vacation or sick leave benefits, any monies paid by or for the employee during a twelve-month period that is more than one hundred twenty percent of the cost of equivalent health, pension or vacation or sick leave benefits. To show equivalency, the plaintiff may submit a mathematical or an actuarial data analysis that demonstrates that the employee would have received at least ninety-five percent of the same value from a product available through the employer or on the general market.

(b) The direct expense rates charged to the plan by third-party insurers and plan providers.

2. Allows an employee to opt out of any health, pension or vacation or sick leave benefits and to choose either:

(a) Benefits from the employee's employer if the employer agrees and the employer withholds payment to the third-party benefits organization for that particular benefit category.

This section provides the exclusive remedy for a violation of this section.  This section does not create a cause of action between an employee and employer.

#### Section 23-1502. Constructive discharge

A. In any action under the statutes of this state or under common law, constructive discharge may only be established by either of the following:

1. Evidence of objectively difficult or unpleasant working conditions to the extent that a reasonable employee would feel compelled to resign, if the employer has been given at least fifteen days' notice by the employee that the employee intends to resign because of these conditions and the employer fails to respond to the employee's concerns.

2. Evidence of outrageous conduct by the employer or a managing agent of the employer, including sexual assault, threats of violence directed at the employee, a continuous pattern of discriminatory harassment by the employer or by a managing agent of the employer or other similar kinds of conduct, if the conduct would cause a reasonable employee to feel compelled to resign.

B. As a precondition to the right of an employee to bring a constructive discharge claim against an employer pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, the employee shall take each of the following actions before deciding whether to resign:

1. Notify an appropriate representative of the employer, in writing, that a working condition exists that the employee believes is objectively so difficult or unpleasant that the employee feels compelled to resign or intends to resign.

2. Allow the employer fifteen calendar days to respond in writing to the matters presented in the employee's written communication under paragraph 1 of this subsection.

3. Read and consider the employer's response to the employee's written communication under paragraph 1 of this subsection.

C. If an employee reasonably believes that the employee cannot continue to work during the period for the employer to respond to the employee's written communication regarding the conditions allegedly constituting constructive discharge, the employee is entitled to a paid or unpaid leave of up to fifteen calendar days or until the time when the employer has responded in writing to the employee's written communication, whichever occurs first.

D. Any communications or actions by an employer in response to an employee's communications about the employee's working conditions shall not be deemed an admission by the employer that it has committed any action that gives rise to any claim or cause of action by the employee against the employer.

E. An employer shall be deemed to have waived the right to notice under subsection A, paragraph 1 if the employer fails to provide written notice to its employees of the requirements of this section as follows:

1. Notice by the employer under this section shall be provided by the posting of a notice, substantially in the form set forth in paragraph 2 of this subsection, in conspicuous places on the employer's premises where notices to employees are customarily posted, by including substantially similar language in an employment handbook or policy manual that is distributed to employees or by including the notice in a written communication that is provided to employees.

2. A notice that is substantially in the following form satisfies the notice requirements of this section:

Notice

An Employee is encouraged to communicate to the employer whenever the employee believes working conditions may become intolerable to the employee and may cause the employee to resign. Under section 23-1502, Arizona Revised Statutes, an employee may be required to notify an appropriate representative of the employer in writing that a working condition exists that the employee believes is intolerable, that will compel the employee to resign or that constitutes a constructive discharge, if the employee wants to preserve the right to bring a claim against the employer alleging that the working condition forced the employee to resign.

Under the law, an employee may be required to wait for fifteen calendar days after providing written notice before the employee may resign if the employee desires to preserve the right to bring a constructive discharge claim against the employer. An employee may be entitled to paid or unpaid leave of absence of up to fifteen calendar days while waiting for the employer to respond to the employee's written communication about the employee's working condition.

F. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, an employee may bring a constructive discharge claim without prior written notice in the event of outrageous conduct by the employer or by a managing agent of the employer including sexual assault, threats of violence directed at the employee, a continuous pattern of discriminatory harassment by the employer or by a managing agent of the employer or other conduct if the conduct would cause a reasonable employee to feel compelled to resign.
