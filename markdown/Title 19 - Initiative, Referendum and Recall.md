If the total number of signatures for verification as determined pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 6 of this section equals or exceeds the constitutional minimum, during the same twenty day period provided in subsection A of this section, the secretary of state shall select, at random, five percent of the total signatures eligible for verification by the county recorders of the counties in which the persons signing the petition claim to be qualified electors. The random sample of signatures to be verified shall be drawn in such a manner that every signature eligible for verification has an equal chance of being included in the sample. The random sample produced shall identify each signature selected by petition page and line number. The signatures selected shall be marked in a clear manner.

C. If a signature line selected for the random sample is found to be blank or was removed from the verification process pursuant to subsection A of this section then the next line down, even if that requires going to the next petition sheet in sequence, on which an eligible signature appears shall be selected as a substitute if that line has not already been selected for the random sample. If the next eligible line is already being used in the random sample, the secretary of state shall proceed back up the page from the signature line originally selected for the random sample to the next previous signature line eligible for verification. If that line is already being used in the random sample, the secretary of state shall continue moving down the page or to the next page from the line originally selected for the random sample and shall select the next eligible signature as its substitute for the random sample. The secretary of state shall use this process of alternately moving forward and backward until a signature eligible for verification and not already included in the random sample can be selected and substituted.

D. After the selection of the random sample and the marking of the signatures selected on the petition sheets pursuant to subsection B of this section, the secretary of state shall transmit a copy of the front of each signature sheet on which a signature included in the random sample appears. The secretary of state shall clearly identify those signatures marked for verification and shall transmit by personal delivery, certified mail, email or other electronic transfer method to each county recorder a copy of each signature sheet on which a signature appears of any individual who claims to be a qualified elector of that county and whose signature was selected for verification as part of the random sample.

E. The secretary of state shall presume that the date noted on the petition for a petitioner's signature is the date on which the petitioner signed the petition, and any person seeking to establish a different date for the signature bears the burden of proof in overcoming the presumption.

F. The secretary of state shall retain an electronic copy of all signature sheets except as otherwise prescribed in this title. After the time period for legal challenges has elapsed, the original sheets shall be made available to the applicant but may be disposed of after a reasonable period of time.

#### Section 19-121.02. Certification by county recorder

## Chapter 2 - RECALL AND ADVISORY RECALL

### Article 1 - Petition and Election Procedures

#### Section 19-201. Officers subject to recall; number of petitioners

A. Every public officer holding an elective office, either by election, appointment or retention, is subject to recall from such office by the qualified electors of the electoral district from which candidates are elected to that office. Such electoral district may include the whole state. A number of qualified electors equaling twenty-five percent of the number of votes cast at the last preceding general election for all the candidates for the office held by the officer, even if the officer was not elected at that election, divided by the number of offices that were being filled at that election, by recall petition, may demand the officer's recall. For a public officer elected at a nonpartisan election, the last preceding general election is the last preceding election at which the public officer who is the subject of the recall was declared elected.

B. In the case of a public officer holding office in a newly created division or district of an elective office, either by election or appointment, a number of qualified electors equaling twenty-five percent of the number of votes cast at the last preceding general election for all those who were candidates for other divisions or districts of the same office held by the officer in that county or city divided by the number of offices that were being filled at that election, by recall petition, may demand the officer's recall.

C. If the elective officer to be recalled was appointed to the office or was deemed elected after an election was canceled due to the absence of opposing candidates as provided in section 15-424, 15-1442, 16-822, 48-802, 48-1012, 48-1208, 48-1404, 48-1908, 48-2010, 48-2107 or 48-2208, the recall petition must be signed by the number of qualified electors that is equal to at least ten percent of the number of active registered voters in the jurisdiction or district represented by that elective officer as determined on the date of the last general election.

#### Section 19-201.01. Legislative finding and intent; strict compliance

The legislature recognizes that recall overturns the determination of the qualified electors and therefore finds and determines that strict compliance with the constitutional and statutory requirements for recall and in the application and enforcement of those requirements provides the surest method for safeguarding the integrity and accuracy of the recall process.  Therefore, the legislature finds and declares its intent that the constitutional and statutory requirements for recall be strictly construed and that persons using the recall process strictly comply with those constitutional and statutory requirements.

 

#### Section 19-202. Recall petition; limitations; subsequent petition

A. A recall petition shall not be circulated against any officer until the officer has held office for six months, except that a petition may be filed against a member of the legislature at any time after five days from the beginning of the first session after the member's election. The commencement of a subsequent term in the same office does not renew the six month period delaying the circulation of a recall petition.

B. After one recall petition and election, no further recall petition shall be filed against the same officer during the term for which the officer was elected unless the petitioners signing the petition first, at the time of application for the subsequent recall petition, pay into the public treasury from which such election expenses were paid all expenses of the preceding election.

 

#### Section 19-202.01. Application for recall petition

A. A person or organization intending to file a recall petition, before causing the petition to be printed and circulated, shall submit an application setting forth the following:

1. The person's name and address or, if an organization, its name and address and the names and titles of its officers.

2. The person's or organization's intention to circulate and submit a recall petition.

3. The text of the general statement required by section 19-203 and a request for issuance of an official number to be printed on the signature sheets of the petition.

B. The application and petition shall be submitted as a single document to the office of secretary of state if for recall of a state officer, including a member of the state legislature, or a member of Congress, and with the county officer in charge of elections if for a county or district officer or superior court judge, with the city or town clerk if for a city or town officer and with the county school superintendent if for a governing board member of a school district.  At the same time and place as submitting the application and petition, the person filing the application shall submit to the filing officer a separate electronic copy of the general statement required by section 19-203 in the format prescribed by the filing officer.

C. On receipt of the application and petition, the filing officer shall assign a number to the petition that shall appear in the lower right-hand corner on each side of each signature sheet and shall issue that number to the applicant. The filing officer shall maintain a record of each application received, of the date of its receipt and of the number assigned and issued to the applicant.

D. When the application is received by the filing officer and marked by the filing officer with an official date and time of receipt, the time-and-date-marked application, including the general statement required by section 19-203, constitutes the official copy of the text of the recall and shall be used in all instances as the text of the recall.  For any subsequent change in the text of the recall by the applicant, including any change in the general statement required by section 19-203, the applicant shall file a new application, shall receive a new official serial number and shall use as the text of the recall the time-and-date-marked text that accompanied the new application, and any signatures that are obtained on the prior recall petition are invalid for the new recall petition.

#### Section 19-203. Recall petition; contents; submission for verification; nonacceptance

A. A recall petition shall contain a general statement of not more than two hundred words stating the grounds of the demand for the recall. The petition shall be submitted for verification of signatures to the appropriate filing officer as prescribed by section 19-202.01.

B. A recall petition is not considered filed for purposes of this chapter until the verification process is complete and the petition is filed pursuant to section 19-208.03, subsection A, paragraph 1.

C. A recall petition shall not be accepted for verification if more than one hundred twenty days have passed since the date of submission of the application for recall petition as prescribed by section 19-202.01.

D. The filing officer's time-and-date-marked copy of the application, including the general statement of the grounds for recall, constitutes the full and correct copy of the recall text and is the only valid copy for circulation for signatures. Signatures that are collected with any copy of the recall text that is not a facsimile of the time-and-date-marked copy with the complete text that is identical to the time-and-date-marked copy issued by the filing officer are invalid.

#### Section 19-204. Form of petition
