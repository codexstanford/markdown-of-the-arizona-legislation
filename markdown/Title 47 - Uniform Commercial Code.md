#### Section 47-1203. Lease distinguished from security interest

A. Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case.

B. A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and:

1. The original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods;

2. The lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods;

3. The lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration on compliance with the lease agreement; or

4. The lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration on compliance with the lease agreement.

C. A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely because:

1. The present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into;

2. The lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods;

3. The lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing, recording or registration fees or service or maintenance costs;

4. The lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods;

5. The lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed; or

6. The lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed.

D. Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee’s reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised.  Additional consideration is not nominal if:

1. When the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed; or

2. When the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed.

E. The "remaining economic life of the goods" and “reasonably predictable" fair market rent, fair market value or cost of performing under the lease agreement must be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into.

 

#### Section 47-1204. Value

Except as otherwise provided in chapters 3, 4 and 5 of this title, a person gives value for rights if the person acquires them:

2. As security for, or in total or partial satisfaction of, a preexisting claim;

3. By accepting delivery under a preexisting contract for purchase; or

4. In return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract.

 

#### Section 47-1205. Reasonable time; "seasonably"

A. Whether a time for taking an action required by this title is reasonable depends on the nature, purpose and circumstances of the action.

B. An action is taken seasonably if it is taken at or within the time agreed or, if no time is agreed, at or within a reasonable time.

 

#### Section 47-1206. Presumptions

Whenever this title creates a "presumption" with respect to a fact, or provides that a fact is "presumed", the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact unless and until evidence is introduced that supports a finding of its nonexistence.

 

### Article 3 - Territorial Applicability and General Rules

#### Section 47-1301. Territorial applicability; parties' power to choose applicable law

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to another state or nation, the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties.

B. In the absence of an agreement effective under subsection A of this section, and except as provided in subsection C of this section, this title applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state.

C. To the extent that this title governs a transaction, if one of the following sections of this title specifies the applicable law, that section governs and a contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted by the law so specified:

1. Section 47-2402.

2. Sections 47-2A105 and 47-2A106.

3. Section 47-4102.

4. Section 47-4A507.

5. Section 47-5116.

6. Section 47-8110.

7. Sections 47-9301 through 47-9307.

 

#### Section 47-1302. Variation by agreement

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection B or elsewhere in this title, the effect of provisions of this title may be varied by agreement.

B. The obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness and care prescribed by this title may not be disclaimed by agreement.  The parties, by agreement, may determine the standards by which the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable.  Whenever this title requires an action to be taken within a reasonable time, a time that is not manifestly unreasonable may be fixed by agreement.

C. The presence in certain provisions of this title of the phrase "unless otherwise agreed", or words of similar import, does not imply that the effect of other provisions may not be varied by agreement under this section.

 

#### Section 47-1303. Course of performance; course of dealing and usage of trade

A. A "course of performance" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if:

1. The agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and

2. The other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection.

B. A "course of dealing" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct.

C. A "usage of trade" is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question.  The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law.

D. A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties’ agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement.  A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance.

E. Except as otherwise provided in subsection F of this section, the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing or usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other.  If such a construction is unreasonable:

1. Express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing and usage of trade;

2. Course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and

3. Course of dealing prevails over usage of trade.

F. Subject to section 47-2209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance.

G. Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party.

 

#### Section 47-1304. Obligation of good faith

Every contract or duty within this title imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement.

 

#### Section 47-1305. Remedies to be liberally administered

A. The remedies provided by this title must be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed but neither consequential or special damages nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided in this title or by other rule of law.

B. Any right or obligation declared by this title is enforceable by action unless the provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect.

 

#### Section 47-1306. Waiver or renunciation of claim or right after breach

A claim or right arising out of an alleged breach may be discharged in whole or in part without consideration by agreement of the aggrieved party in an authenticated record.

 

#### Section 47-1307. Prima facie evidence by third party documents

A document in due form purporting to be a bill of lading, policy or certificate of insurance, official weigher's or inspector’s certificate, consular invoice or any other document authorized or required by the contract to be issued by a third party is prima facie evidence of its own authenticity and genuineness and of the facts stated in the document by the third party.

 

#### Section 47-1308. Performance or acceptance under reservation of rights

A. A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not prejudice the rights reserved.  Such words as "without prejudice", “under protest" or the like are sufficient.

B. Subsection A does not apply to an accord and satisfaction.

 

#### Section 47-1309. Option to accelerate at will

A term providing that one party or that party’s successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral "at will" or when the party "deems itself insecure", or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired. The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power has been exercised.

 

#### Section 47-1310. Subordinated obligation

An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation of the person obligated or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated.  Subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor.

C. "Termination" occurs when either party pursuant to a power created by agreement or law puts an end to the contract otherwise than for its breach. On "termination" all obligations which are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior breach or performance survives.

D. "Cancellation" occurs when either party puts an end to the contract for breach by the other and its effect is the same as that of "termination" except that the cancelling party also retains any remedy for breach of the whole contract or any unperformed balance.

#### Section 47-2107. Goods to be severed from realty; recording

A. A contract for the sale of minerals or the like (including oil and gas) or a structure or its materials to be removed from realty is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter if they are to be severed by the seller but until severance a purported present sale thereof which is not effective as a transfer of an interest in land is effective only as a contract to sell.

B. A contract for the sale apart from the land of growing crops or other things attached to realty and capable of severance without material harm thereto but not described in subsection A or of timber to be cut is a contract for the sale of goods within this chapter whether the subject matter is to be severed by the buyer or by the seller even though it forms part of the realty at the time of contracting, and the parties can by identification effect a present sale before severance.

C. The provisions of this section are subject to any third party rights provided by the law relating to realty records, and the contract for sale may be executed and recorded as a document transferring an interest in land and shall then constitute notice to third parties of the buyer's rights under the contract for sale.

### Article 2 - Form, Formation and Readjustment of Contract

#### Section 47-2201. Formal requirements; statute of frauds

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a contract for the sale of goods for the price of five hundred dollars or more is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless there is some writing sufficient to indicate that a contract for sale has been made between the parties and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by his authorized agent or broker. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon but the contract is not enforceable under this subsection beyond the quantity of goods shown in such writing.

B. Between merchants if within a reasonable time a writing in confirmation of the contract and sufficient against the sender is received and the party receiving it has reason to know its contents, it satisfies the requirements of subsection A of this section against such party unless written notice of objection to its contents is given within ten days after it is received.

C. A contract which does not satisfy the requirements of subsection A of this section but which is valid in other respects is enforceable:

1. If the goods are to be specially manufactured for the buyer and are not suitable for sale to others in the ordinary course of the seller's business and the seller, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances which reasonably indicate that the goods are for the buyer, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement; or

2. If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a contract for sale was made, but the contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or

3. With respect to goods for which payment had been made and accepted or which have been received and accepted (section 47-2606).

#### Section 47-2202. Final written expression: parol or extrinsic evidence

Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented:

1. By course of performance, course of dealing or usage of trade (section 47-1303); and

2. By evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.

 

#### Section 47-2203. Seals inoperative

The affixing of a seal to a writing evidencing a contract for sale or an offer to buy or sell goods does not constitute the writing a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to such a contract or offer.

#### Section 47-2204. Formation in general

A. A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract.

B. An agreement sufficient to constitute a contract for sale may be found even though the moment of its making is undetermined.

C. Even though one or more terms are left open a contract for sale does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.

#### Section 47-2205. Firm offers

An offer by a merchant to buy or sell goods in a signed writing which by its terms gives assurance that it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or if no time is stated for a reasonable time, but in no event may such period of irrevocability exceed three months; but any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

#### Section 47-2206. Offer and acceptance in formation of contract

A. Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances:

1. An offer to make a contract shall be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.

2. An order or other offer to buy goods for prompt or current shipment shall be construed as inviting acceptance either by a prompt promise to ship or by the prompt or current shipment of conforming or non-conforming goods, but such a shipment of non-conforming goods does not constitute an acceptance if the seller seasonably notifies the buyer that the shipment is offered only as an accommodation to the buyer.

B. Where the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.

#### Section 47-2207. Additional terms in acceptance or confirmation

A. A definite and seasonable expression of acceptance or a written confirmation which is sent within a reasonable time operates as an acceptance even though it states terms additional to or different from those offered or agreed upon, unless acceptance is expressly made conditional on assent to the additional or different terms.

B. The additional terms are to be construed as proposals for addition to the contract. Between merchants such terms become part of the contract unless:

1. The offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer;

2. They materially alter it; or

3. Notification of objection to them has already been given or is given within a reasonable time after notice of them is received.

C. Conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a contract is sufficient to establish a contract for sale although the writings of the parties do not otherwise establish a contract. In such case the terms of the particular contract consist of those terms on which the writings of the parties agree, together with any supplementary terms incorporated under any other provisions of this title.

#### Section 47-2209. Modification, rescission and waiver

A. An agreement modifying a contract within this chapter needs no consideration to be binding.

B. A signed agreement which excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing cannot be otherwise modified or rescinded, but except as between merchants such a requirement on a form supplied by the merchant must be separately signed by the other party.

C. The requirements of the statute of frauds section of this chapter (section 47-2201) must be satisfied if the contract as modified is within its provisions.

D. Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection B or C of this section it can operate as a waiver.

E. A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of the contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

#### Section 47-2210. Delegation of performance; assignment of rights

A. A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach.

B. Unless otherwise agreed all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise.

C. The creation, attachment, perfection or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection B unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but:

1. The seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer; and

2. A court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement.

D. Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of "the contract" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance.

E. An assignment of "the contract" or of "all my rights under the contract" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract.

F. The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee (section 47-2609).

### Article 3 - General Obligation and Construction of Contract

#### Section 47-2301. General obligations of parties

The obligation of the seller is to transfer and deliver and that of the buyer is to accept and pay in accordance with the contract.

#### Section 47-2302. Unconscionable contract or clause

A. If the court as a matter of law finds the contract or any clause of the contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.

B. When it is claimed or appears to the court that the contract or any clause thereof may be unconscionable the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to its commercial setting, purpose and effect to aid the court in making the determination.

#### Section 47-2303. Allocation or division of risks

Where this chapter allocates a risk or a burden as between the parties "unless otherwise agreed", the agreement may not only shift the allocation but may also divide the risk or burden.

#### Section 47-2304. Price payable in money, goods, realty, or otherwise

A. The price can be made payable in money or otherwise. If it is payable in whole or in part in goods each party is a seller of the goods which he is to transfer.

B. Even though all or part of the price is payable in an interest in realty the transfer of the goods and the seller's obligations with reference to them are subject to this chapter, but not the transfer of the interest in realty or the transferor's obligations in connection therewith.

#### Section 47-2305. Open price term

A. The parties if they so intend can conclude a contract for sale even though the price is not settled. In such a case the price is a reasonable price at the time for delivery if:

1. Nothing is said as to price; or

2. The price is left to be agreed by the parties and they fail to agree; or

3. The price is to be fixed in terms of some agreed market or other standard as set or recorded by a third person or agency and it is not so set or recorded.

B. A price to be fixed by the seller or by the buyer means a price for him to fix in good faith.

C. When a price left to be fixed otherwise than by agreement of the parties fails to be fixed through fault of one party the other may at his option treat the contract as cancelled or himself fix a reasonable price.

D. Where, however, the parties intend not to be bound unless the price be fixed or agreed and it is not fixed or agreed there is no contract. In such a case the buyer must return any goods already received or if unable so to do must pay their reasonable value at the time of delivery and the seller must return any portion of the price paid on account.

#### Section 47-2306. Output, requirements and exclusive dealings

A. A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer means such actual output or requirements as may occur in good faith, except that no quantity unreasonably disproportionate to any stated estimate or in the absence of a stated estimate to any normal or otherwise comparable prior output or requirements may be tendered or demanded.

B. A lawful agreement by either the seller or the buyer for exclusive dealing in the kind of goods concerned imposes unless otherwise agreed an obligation by the seller to use best efforts to supply the goods and by the buyer to use best efforts to promote their sale.

#### Section 47-2307. Delivery in single lot or several lots

Unless otherwise agreed all goods called for by a contract for sale must be tendered in a single delivery and payment is due only on such tender but where the circumstances give either party the right to make or demand delivery in lots the price if it can be apportioned may be demanded for each lot.

#### Section 47-2308. Absence of specified place for delivery

Unless otherwise agreed:

1. The place for delivery of goods is the seller's place of business or if he has none his residence; but

2. In a contract for sale of identified goods which to the knowledge of the parties at the time of contracting are in some other place, that place is the place for their delivery; and

3. Documents of title may be delivered through customary banking channels.

#### Section 47-2309. Absence of specific time provisions; notice of termination

A. The time for shipment or delivery or any other action under a contract if not provided in this chapter or agreed upon shall be a reasonable time.

B. Where the contract provides for successive performances but is indefinite in duration it is valid for a reasonable time but unless otherwise agreed may be terminated at any time by either party.

C. Termination of a contract by one party except on the happening of an agreed event requires that reasonable notification be received by the other party and an agreement dispensing with notification is invalid if its operation would be unconscionable.

#### Section 47-2310. Open time for payment or running of credit; authority to ship under reservation

Unless otherwise agreed:

1. Payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the goods even though the place of shipment is the place of delivery; and

2. If the seller is authorized to send the goods he may ship them under reservation, and may tender the documents of title, but the buyer may inspect the goods after their arrival before payment is due unless such inspection is inconsistent with the terms of the contract (section 47-2513); and

3. If delivery is authorized and made by way of documents of title otherwise than by paragraph 2 then payment is due regardless of where the goods are to be received:

(a) At the time and place at which the buyer is to receive delivery of the tangible documents; or

(b) At the time the buyer is to receive delivery of the electronic documents and at the seller's place of business or, if none, the seller's residence; and

4. Where the seller is required or authorized to ship the goods on credit the credit period runs from the time of shipment but postdating the invoice or delaying its dispatch will correspondingly delay the starting of the credit period.

 

#### Section 47-2311. Options and cooperation respecting performance

A. An agreement for sale which is otherwise sufficiently definite (subsection C of section 47-2204) to be a contract is not made invalid by the fact that it leaves particulars of performance to be specified by one of the parties. Any such specification must be made in good faith and within limits set by commercial reasonableness.

B. Unless otherwise agreed specifications relating to assortment of the goods are at the buyer's option and except as otherwise provided in paragraph 3 of subsection A and all of subsection C of section 47-2319 specifications or arrangements relating to shipment are at the seller's option.

C. Where such specification would materially affect the other party's performance but is not seasonably made or where one party's cooperation is necessary to the agreed performance of the other but is not seasonably forthcoming, the other party in addition to all other remedies:

1. Is excused for any resulting delay in his own performance; and

2. May also either proceed to perform in any reasonable manner or after the time for a material part of his own performance treat the failure to specify or to cooperate as a breach by failure to deliver or accept the goods.

#### Section 47-2312. Warranty of title and against infringement; buyer's obligation against infringement

A. Subject to subsection B there is in a contract for sale a warranty by the seller that:

1. The title conveyed shall be good, and its transfer rightful; and

2. The goods shall be delivered free from any security interest or other lien or encumbrance of which the buyer at the time of contracting has no knowledge.

B. A warranty under subsection A will be excluded or modified only by specific language or by circumstances which give the buyer reason to know that the person selling does not claim title in himself or that he is purporting to sell only such right or title as he or a third person may have.

C. Unless otherwise agreed a seller who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind warrants that the goods shall be delivered free of the rightful claim of any third person by way of infringement or the like but a buyer who furnishes specifications to the seller must hold the seller harmless against any such claim which arises out of compliance with the specifications.

#### Section 47-2313. Express warranties by affirmation, promise, description, sample

A. Express warranties by the seller are created as follows:

1. Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the seller to the buyer which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the affirmation or promise.

2. Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods shall conform to the description.

3. Any sample or model which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods shall conform to the sample or model.

B. It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the seller use formal words such as "warrant" or "guarantee" or that he have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.

#### Section 47-2314. Implied warranty: merchantability; usage of trade

A. Unless excluded or modified (section 47-2316), a warranty that the goods shall be merchantable is implied in a contract for their sale if the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind. Under this section the service for value of food or drink to be consumed either on the premises or elsewhere is a sale.

B. Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as:

1. Pass without objection in the trade under the contract description; and

2. In the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description; and

3. Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which such goods are used; and

4. Run, within the variations permitted by the agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved; and

5. Are adequately contained, packaged, and labeled as the agreement may require; and

6. Conform to the promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label if any.

C. Unless excluded or modified (section 47-2316), other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.

#### Section 47-2315. Implied warranty: fitness for particular purpose

Where the seller at the time of contracting has reason to know any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the buyer is relying on the seller's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is unless excluded or modified under section 47-2316 an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for such purpose.

#### Section 47-2316. Exclusion or modification of warranties

A. Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit warranty shall be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other; but subject to the provisions of this chapter on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 47-2202) negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that such construction is unreasonable.

B. Subject to subsection C of this section, to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention merchantability and in case of a writing must be conspicuous, and to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it states, for example, that "there are no warranties which extend beyond the description on the face hereof".

C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section:

1. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is", "with all faults" or other language which in common understanding calls the buyer's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty; and

2. When the buyer before entering into the contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as he desired or has refused to examine the goods there is no implied warranty with regard to defects which an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed to him; and

3. An implied warranty can also be excluded or modified by course of dealing or course of performance or usage of trade.

D. Remedies for breach of warranty can be limited in accordance with the provisions of this chapter on liquidation or limitation of damages and on contractual modification of remedy (sections 47-2718 and 47-2719).

#### Section 47-2317. Cumulation and conflict of warranties express or implied

Warranties whether express or implied shall be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if such construction is unreasonable the intention of the parties shall determine which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:

1. Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description.

2. A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description.

3. Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

#### Section 47-2318. Third party beneficiaries of warranties express or implied

A seller's warranty whether express or implied extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of his buyer or who is a guest in his home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. A seller may not exclude or limit the operation of this section.

#### Section 47-2319. F.O.B. and F.A.S. terms

A. Unless otherwise agreed the term F.O.B. (which means "free on board") at a named place, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which:

1. When the term is F.O.B. the place of shipment, the seller must at that place ship the goods in the manner provided in this chapter (section 47-2504) and bear the expense and risk of putting them into the possession of the carrier; or

2. When the term is F.O.B. the place of destination, the seller must at his own expense and risk transport the goods to that place and there tender delivery of them in the manner provided in this chapter (section 47-2503);

3. When under either paragraph 1 or 2 the term is also F.O.B. vessel, car or other vehicle, the seller must in addition at his own expense and risk load the goods on board. If the term is F.O.B. vessel the buyer must name the vessel and in an appropriate case the seller must comply with the provisions of this chapter on the form of bill of lading (section 47-2323).

B. Unless otherwise agreed the term F.A.S. vessel (which means "free alongside") at a named port, even though used only in connection with the stated price, is a delivery term under which the seller must:

1. At his own expense and risk deliver the goods alongside the vessel in the manner usual in that port or on a dock designated and provided by the buyer; and

2. Obtain and tender a receipt for the goods in exchange for which the carrier is under a duty to issue a bill of lading.

C. Unless otherwise agreed in any case falling within paragraph 1 or 3 of subsection A of this section or within subsection B of this section the buyer must seasonably give any needed instructions for making delivery, including when the term is F.A.S. or F.O.B. the loading berth of the vessel and in an appropriate case its name and sailing date. The seller may treat the failure of needed instructions as a failure of cooperation under this chapter (section 47-2311). He may also at his option move the goods in any reasonable manner preparatory to delivery or shipment.

D. Under the term F.O.B. vessel or F.A.S. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.

#### Section 47-2320. C.I.F. and C. & F. terms

A. The term C.I.F. means that the price includes in a lump sum the cost of the goods and the insurance and freight to the named destination. The term C. & F. or C.F. means that the price so includes cost and freight to the named destination.

B. Unless otherwise agreed and even though used only in connection with the stated price and destination, the term C.I.F. destination or its equivalent requires the seller at his own expense and risk to:

1. Put the goods into the possession of a carrier at the port for shipment and obtain a negotiable bill or bills of lading covering the entire transportation to the named destination; and

2. Load the goods and obtain a receipt from the carrier (which may be contained in the bill of lading) showing that the freight has been paid or provided for; and

3. Obtain a policy or certificate of insurance, including any war risk insurance, of a kind and on terms then current at the port of shipment in the usual amount, in the currency of the contract, shown to cover the same goods covered by the bill of lading and providing for payment of loss to the order of the buyer or for the account of whom it may concern; but the seller may add to the price the amount of the premium for any such war risk insurance; and

4. Prepare an invoice of the goods and procure any other documents required to effect shipment or to comply with the contract; and

5. Forward and tender with commercial promptness all the documents in due form and with any indorsement necessary to perfect the buyer's rights.

C. Unless otherwise agreed the term C. & F. or its equivalent has the same effect and imposes upon the seller the same obligations and risks as a C.I.F. term except the obligation as to insurance.

D. Under the term C.I.F. or C. & F. unless otherwise agreed the buyer must make payment against tender of the required documents and the seller may not tender nor the buyer demand delivery of the goods in substitution for the documents.

#### Section 47-2321. C.I.F. or C. & F.: "net landed weights"; "payment on arrival"; warranty of condition on arrival

Under a contract containing a term C.I.F. or C. & F.:

1. Where the price is based on or is to be adjusted according to "net landed weights", "delivered weights", "out turn" quantity or quality or the like, unless otherwise agreed the seller must reasonably estimate the price. The payment due on tender of the documents called for by the contract is the amount so estimated, but after final adjustment of the price a settlement must be made with commercial promptness.

2. An agreement described in paragraph 1 or any warranty of quality or condition of the goods on arrival places upon the seller the risk of ordinary deterioration, shrinkage and the like in transportation but has no effect on the place or time of identification to the contract for sale or delivery or on the passing of the risk of loss.

3. Unless otherwise agreed where the contract provides for payment on or after arrival of the goods the seller must before payment allow such preliminary inspection as is feasible; but if the goods are lost delivery of the documents and payment are due when the goods should have arrived.

#### Section 47-2322. Delivery "ex-ship"

A. Unless otherwise agreed a term for delivery of goods "ex-ship" (which means from the carrying vessel) or in equivalent language is not restricted to a particular ship and requires delivery from a ship which has reached a place at the named port of destination where goods of the kind are usually discharged.

B. Under such a term unless otherwise agreed:

1. The seller must discharge all liens arising out of the carriage and furnish the buyer with a direction which puts the carrier under a duty to deliver the goods; and

2. The risk of loss does not pass to the buyer until the goods leave the ship's tackle or are otherwise properly unloaded.

#### Section 47-2323. Form of bill of lading required in overseas shipment; "overseas"

A. Where the contract contemplates overseas shipment and contains a term C.I.F. or C. & F. or F.O.B. vessel, the seller unless otherwise agreed must obtain a negotiable bill of lading stating that the goods have been loaded on board or, in the case of a term C.I.F. or C. & F., received for shipment.

B. Where in a case within subsection A of this section a tangible bill of lading has been issued in a set of parts, unless otherwise agreed if the documents are not to be sent from abroad the buyer may demand tender of the full set; otherwise only one part of the bill of lading need be tendered. Even if the agreement expressly requires a full set:

1. Due tender of a single part is acceptable within the provisions of this chapter on cure of improper delivery (subsection A of section 47-2508); and

2. Even though the full set is demanded, if the documents are sent from abroad the person tendering an incomplete set may nevertheless require payment upon furnishing an indemnity which the buyer in good faith deems adequate.

C. A shipment by water or by air or a contract contemplating such shipment is "overseas" insofar as by usage of trade or agreement it is subject to the commercial, financing or shipping practices characteristic of international deep water commerce.

 

#### Section 47-2324. "No arrival, no sale" term

Under a term "no arrival, no sale" or terms of like meaning, unless otherwise agreed:

1. The seller must properly ship conforming goods and if they arrive by any means he must tender them on arrival but he assumes no obligation that the goods will arrive unless he has caused the non-arrival; and

2. Where without fault of the seller the goods are in part lost or have so deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract or arrive after the contract time, the buyer may proceed as if there had been casualty to identified goods (section 47-2613).

#### Section 47-2325. "Letter of credit" term; "confirmed credit"

A. Failure of the buyer seasonably to furnish an agreed letter of credit is a breach of the contract for sale.

B. The delivery to seller of a proper letter of credit suspends the buyer's obligation to pay. If the letter of credit is dishonored, the seller may on seasonable notification to the buyer require payment directly from him.

C. Unless otherwise agreed the term "letter of credit" or "banker's credit" in a contract for sale means an irrevocable credit issued by a financing agency of good repute and, where the shipment is overseas, of good international repute. The term "confirmed credit" means that the credit must also carry the direct obligation of such an agency which does business in the seller's financial market.

#### Section 47-2326. Sale on approval and sale or return; rights of creditors

A. Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer even though they conform to the contract, the transaction is:

1. A "sale on approval" if the goods are delivered primarily for use, and

2. A "sale or return" if the goods are delivered primarily for resale.

B. Goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors until acceptance; goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession.

C. Any "or return" term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this chapter (section 47-2201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this chapter on parol or extrinsic evidence (section 47-2202).

#### Section 47-2327. Special incidents of sale on approval and sale or return

A. Under a sale on approval unless otherwise agreed:

1. Although the goods are identified to the contract the risk of loss and the title do not pass to the buyer until acceptance; and

2. Use of the goods consistent with the purpose of trial is not acceptance but failure seasonably to notify the seller of election to return the goods is acceptance, and if the goods conform to the contract acceptance of any part is acceptance of the whole; and

3. After due notification of election to return, the return is at the seller's risk and expense but a merchant buyer must follow any reasonable instructions.

B. Under a sale or return unless otherwise agreed:

1. The option to return extends to the whole or any commercial unit of the goods while in substantially their original condition, but must be exercised seasonably; and

2. The return is at the buyer's risk and expense.

#### Section 47-2328. Sale by auction

A. In a sale by auction if goods are put up in lots each lot is the subject of a separate sale.

B. A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer so announces by the fall of the hammer or in other customary manner. Where a bid is made while the hammer is falling in acceptance of a prior bid the auctioneer may in his discretion reopen the bidding or declare the goods sold under the bid on which the hammer was falling.

C. Such a sale is with reserve unless the goods are in explicit terms put up without reserve. In an auction with reserve the auctioneer may withdraw the goods at any time until he announces completion of the sale. In an auction without reserve, after the auctioneer calls for bids on an article or lot, that article or lot cannot be withdrawn unless no bid is made within a reasonable time. In either case a bidder may retract his bid until the auctioneer's announcement of completion of the sale, but a bidder's retraction does not revive any previous bid.

D. If the auctioneer knowingly receives a bid on the seller's behalf or the seller makes or procures such a bid, and notice has not been given that liberty for such bidding is reserved, the buyer may at his option avoid the sale or take the goods at the price of the last good faith bid prior to the completion of the sale. This subsection shall not apply to any bid at a forced sale.

### Article 4 - Title, Creditors and Good Faith Purchases

#### Section 47-2401. Passing of title; reservation for security; limited application of this section

Each provision of this chapter with regard to the rights, obligations and remedies of the seller, the buyer, purchasers or other third parties applies irrespective of title to the goods except where the provision refers to such title. Insofar as situations are not covered by the other provisions of this chapter and matters concerning title become material the following rules apply:

1. Title to goods cannot pass under a contract for sale prior to their identification to the contract (section 47-2501), and unless otherwise explicitly agreed the buyer acquires by their identification a special property as limited by this title. Any retention or reservation by the seller of the title (property) in goods shipped or delivered to the buyer is limited in effect to a reservation of a security interest.  Subject to these provisions and to the provisions of the chapter on secured transactions (chapter 9 of this title), title to goods passes from the seller to the buyer in any manner and on any conditions explicitly agreed on by the parties.

2. Unless otherwise explicitly agreed title passes to the buyer at the time and place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods, despite any reservation of a security interest and even though a document of title is to be delivered at a different time or place; and in particular and despite any reservation of a security interest by the bill of lading:

(a) If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send the goods to the buyer but does not require him to deliver them at destination, title passes to the buyer at the time and place of shipment; but

(b) If the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on tender there.

3. Unless otherwise explicitly agreed where delivery is to be made without moving the goods:

(a) If the seller is to deliver a tangible document of title, title passes at the time when and the place where he delivers such documents and if the seller is to deliver an electronic document of title, title passes when the seller delivers the document; or

(b) If the goods are at the time of contracting already identified and no documents of title are to be delivered, title passes at the time and place of contracting.

4. A rejection or other refusal by the buyer to receive or retain the goods, whether or not justified, or a justified revocation of acceptance revests title to the goods in the seller.  Such revesting occurs by operation of law and is not a "sale".

 

#### Section 47-2402. Rights of seller's creditors against sold goods

A. Except as provided in subsections B and C of this section, rights of unsecured creditors of the seller with respect to goods which have been identified to a contract for sale are subject to the buyer's rights to recover the goods under this chapter (sections 47-2502 and 47-2716).

B. A creditor of the seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against him a retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated, except that retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by a merchant-seller for a commercially reasonable time after a sale of identification is not fraudulent.

C. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to impair the rights of creditors of the seller:

1. Under the provisions of the chapter on secured transactions (chapter 9 of this title); or

2. Where identification to the contract or delivery is made not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a preexisting claim for money, security or the like and is made under circumstances which under any rule of law of the state where the goods are situated would apart from this chapter constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference.

#### Section 47-2403. Power to transfer; good faith purchase of goods; "entrusting"

A. A purchaser of goods acquires all title which his transferor had or had power to transfer except that a purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased. A person with voidable title has power to transfer a good title to a good faith purchaser for value. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase the purchaser has such power even though:

1. The transferor was deceived as to the identity of the purchaser, or

2. The delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored, or

3. It was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale", or

4. The delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.

B. Any entrusting of possession of goods to a merchant who deals in goods of that kind gives him power to transfer all rights of the entruster to a buyer in ordinary course of business.

C. "Entrusting" includes any delivery and any acquiescence in retention of possession regardless of any condition expressed between the parties to the delivery or acquiescence and regardless of whether the procurement of the entrusting or the possessor's disposition of the goods have been such as to be larcenous under the criminal law.

D. The rights of other purchasers of goods and of lien creditors are governed by the chapters on secured transactions (chapter 9 of this title) and documents of title (chapter 7 of this title).

 

### Article 5 - Performance

#### Section 47-2501. Insurable interest in goods; manner of identification of goods

A. The buyer obtains a special property and an insurable interest in goods by identification of existing goods as goods to which the contract refers even though the goods so identified are non-conforming and he has an option to return or reject them. Such identification can be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement identification occurs:

1. When the contract is made if it is for the sale of goods already existing and identified;

2. If the contract is for the sale of future goods other than those described in paragraph 3, when goods are shipped, marked or otherwise designated by the seller as goods to which the contract refers;

3. When the crops are planted or otherwise become growing crops or the young are conceived if the contract is for the sale of unborn young to be born within twelve months after contracting or for the sale of crops to be harvested within twelve months or the next normal harvest season after contracting whichever is longer.

B. The seller retains an insurable interest in goods so long as title to or any security interest in the goods remains in him and where the identification is by the seller alone he may until default or insolvency or notification to the buyer that the identification is final substitute other goods for those identified.

C. Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.

#### Section 47-2502. Buyer's right to goods on seller's insolvency

A. Subject to subsections B and C of this section and even though the goods have not been shipped a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he has a special property under the provisions of section 47-2501 may on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if:

1. In the case of goods bought for personal, family or household purposes, the seller repudiates or fails to deliver as required by the contract; or

2. In all cases, the seller becomes insolvent within ten days after receipt of the first installment on their price.

B. The buyer's right to recover the goods under subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section vests on acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver.

C. If the identification creating his special property has been made by the buyer he acquires the right to recover the goods only if they conform to the contract for sale.

#### Section 47-2503. Manner of seller's tender of delivery

A. Tender of delivery requires that the seller put and hold conforming goods at the buyer's disposition and give the buyer any notification reasonably necessary to enable him to take delivery. The manner, time and place for tender are determined by the agreement and this chapter, and in particular:

1. Tender must be at a reasonable hour, and if it is of goods they must be kept available for the period reasonably necessary to enable the buyer to take possession; but

2. Unless otherwise agreed the buyer must furnish facilities reasonably suited to the receipt of the goods.

B. Where the case is within section 47-2504 respecting shipment tender requires that the seller comply with its provisions.

C. Where the seller is required to deliver at a particular destination tender requires that he comply with subsection A of this section and also in any appropriate case tender documents as described in subsections D and E of this section.

D. Where goods are in the possession of a bailee and are to be delivered without being moved:

1. Tender requires that the seller either tender a negotiable document of title covering such goods or procure acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods; but

2. Tender to the buyer of a nonnegotiable document of title or of a record directing the bailee to deliver is sufficient tender, unless the buyer seasonably objects, and, except as otherwise provided in chapter 9 of this title, receipt by the bailee of notification of the buyer's rights fixes those rights as against the bailee and all third persons; but risk of loss of the goods and of any failure by the bailee to honor the nonnegotiable document of title or to obey the direction remains on the seller until the buyer has had a reasonable time to present the document or direction, and a refusal by the bailee to honor the document or to obey the direction defeats the tender.

E. Where the contract requires the seller to deliver documents:

1. He must tender all such documents in correct form, except as provided in this chapter with respect to bills of lading in a set (subsection B of section 47-2323); and

2. Tender through customary banking channels is sufficient and dishonor of a draft accompanying or associated with the documents constitutes nonacceptance or rejection.

 

#### Section 47-2504. Shipment by seller

Where the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer and the contract does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, then unless otherwise agreed he must:

1. Put the goods in the possession of such a carrier and make such a contract for their transportation as may be reasonable having regard to the nature of the goods and other circumstances of the case; and

2. Obtain and promptly deliver or tender in due form any document necessary to enable the buyer to obtain possession of the goods or otherwise required by the agreement or by usage of trade; and

3. Promptly notify the buyer of the shipment. Failure to notify the buyer under paragraph 3 or to make a proper contract under paragraph 1 is a ground for rejection only if material delay or loss ensues.

#### Section 47-2505. Seller's shipment under reservation

A. Where the seller has identified goods to the contract by or before shipment:

1. His procurement of a negotiable bill of lading to his own order or otherwise reserves in him a security interest in the goods. His procurement of the bill to the order of a financing agency or of the buyer indicates in addition only the seller's expectation of transferring that interest to the person named.

2. A nonnegotiable bill of lading to himself or his nominee reserves possession of the goods as security but except in a case of conditional delivery (subsection B of section 47-2507) a nonnegotiable bill of lading naming the buyer as consignee reserves no security interest even though the seller retains possession or control of the bill of lading.

B. When shipment by the seller with reservation of a security interest is in violation of the contract for sale it constitutes an improper contract for transportation within section 47-2504 but impairs neither the rights given to the buyer by shipment and identification of the goods to the contract nor the seller's powers as a holder of a negotiable document of title.

 

#### Section 47-2506. Rights of financing agency

A. A financing agency by paying or purchasing for value a draft which relates to a shipment of goods acquires to the extent of the payment or purchase and in addition to its own rights under the draft and any document of title securing it any rights of the shipper in the goods including the right to stop delivery and the shipper's right to have the draft honored by the buyer.

B. The right to reimbursement of a financing agency which has in good faith honored or purchased the draft under commitment to or authority from the buyer is not impaired by subsequent discovery of defects with reference to any relevant document which was apparently regular.

 

#### Section 47-2507. Effect of seller's tender; delivery on condition

A. Tender of delivery is a condition to the buyer's duty to accept the goods and, unless otherwise agreed, to his duty to pay for them.  Tender entitles the seller to acceptance of the goods and to payment according to the contract.

B. Where payment is due and demanded on the delivery to the buyer of goods or documents of title, his right as against the seller to retain or dispose of them is conditional upon his making the payment due.

#### Section 47-2508. Cure by seller of improper tender or delivery; replacement

A. Where any tender or delivery by the seller is rejected because non-conforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the seller may seasonably notify the buyer of his intention to cure and may then within the contract time make a conforming delivery.

B. Where the buyer rejects a non-conforming tender which the seller had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance the seller may if he seasonably notifies the buyer have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender.

#### Section 47-2509. Risk of loss in the absence of breach

A. Where the contract requires or authorizes the seller to ship the goods by carrier:

1. If it does not require him to deliver them at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier even though the shipment is under reservation (section 47-2505); but

2. If it does require him to deliver them at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the buyer when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the buyer to take delivery.

B. Where the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the buyer:

1. On his receipt of possession or control of a negotiable document of title covering the goods; or

2. On acknowledgment by the bailee of the buyer's right to possession of the goods; or

3. After his receipt of possession or control of a nonnegotiable document of title or other direction to deliver in a record, as provided in paragraph 2, subsection D of section 47-2503.

C. In any case not within subsection A or B of this section, the risk of loss passes to the buyer on his receipt of the goods if the seller is a merchant; otherwise the risk passes to the buyer on tender of delivery.

D. The provisions of this section are subject to contrary agreement of the parties and to the provisions of this chapter on sale on approval (section 47-2327) and on effect of breach on risk of loss (section 47-2510).

 

#### Section 47-2510. Effect of breach on risk of loss

A. Where a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the contract as to give a right of rejection the risk of their loss remains on the seller until cure or acceptance.

B. Where the buyer rightfully revokes acceptance he may to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk of loss as having rested on the seller from the beginning.

C. Where the buyer as to conforming goods already identified to the contract for sale repudiates or is otherwise in breach before risk of their loss has passed to him, the seller may to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage treat the risk of loss as resting on the buyer for a commercially reasonable time.

#### Section 47-2511. Tender of payment by buyer; payment by check

A. Unless otherwise agreed tender of payment is a condition to the seller's duty to tender and complete any delivery.

B. Tender of payment is sufficient when made by any means or in any manner current in the ordinary course of business unless the seller demands payment in legal tender and gives any extension of time reasonably necessary to procure it.

C. Subject to the provisions of this title on the effect of an instrument on an obligation (section 47-3310), payment by check is conditional and is defeated as between the parties by dishonor of the check on due presentment.

#### Section 47-2512. Payment by buyer before inspection

A. Where the contract requires payment before inspection non-conformity of the goods does not excuse the buyer from so making payment unless:

1. The non-conformity appears without inspection; or

2. Despite tender of the required documents the circumstances would justify injunction against honor under this title (section 47-5109, subsection B).

B. Payment pursuant to subsection A of this section does not constitute an acceptance of goods or impair the buyer's right to inspect or any of his remedies.

#### Section 47-2513. Buyer's right to inspection of goods

A. Unless otherwise agreed and subject to subsection C of this section, where goods are tendered or delivered or identified to the contract for sale, the buyer has a right before payment or acceptance to inspect them at any reasonable place and time and in any reasonable manner.  When the seller is required or authorized to send the goods to the buyer, the inspection may be after their arrival.

B. Expenses of inspection must be borne by the buyer but may be recovered from the seller if the goods do not conform and are rejected.

C. Unless otherwise agreed and subject to the provisions of this chapter on C.I.F. contracts (subsection C of section 47-2321), the buyer is not entitled to inspect the goods before payment of the price when the contract provides:

1. For delivery "C.O.D." or on other like terms; or

2. For payment against documents of title, except where such payment is due only after the goods are to become available for inspection.

D. A place or method of inspection fixed by the parties is presumed to be exclusive but unless otherwise expressly agreed it does not postpone identification or shift the place for delivery or for passing the risk of loss. If compliance becomes impossible, inspection shall be as provided in this section unless the place or method fixed was clearly intended as an indispensable condition failure of which avoids the contract.

#### Section 47-2514. When documents deliverable on acceptance; when on payment

Unless otherwise agreed documents against which a draft is drawn are to be delivered to the drawee on acceptance of the draft if it is payable more than three days after presentment; otherwise, only on payment.

#### Section 47-2515. Preserving evidence of goods in dispute

In furtherance of the adjustment of any claim or dispute:

1. Either party on reasonable notification to the other and for the purpose of ascertaining the facts and preserving evidence has the right to inspect, test and sample the goods including such of them as may be in the possession or control of the other; and

2. The parties may agree to a third party inspection or survey to determine the conformity or condition of the goods and may agree that the findings shall be binding upon them in any subsequent litigation or adjustment.

### Article 6 - Breach, Repudiation and Excuse

#### Section 47-2601. Buyer's rights on improper delivery

Subject to the provisions of this chapter on breach in installment contracts (section 47-2612) and unless otherwise agreed under the sections on contractual limitations of remedy (sections 47-2718 and 47-2719), if the goods or the tender of delivery fail in any respect to conform to the contract, the buyer may:

1. Reject the whole; or

2. Accept the whole; or

3. Accept any commercial unit or units and reject the rest.

#### Section 47-2602. Manner and effect of rightful rejection

A. Rejection of goods must be within a reasonable time after their delivery or tender. It is ineffective unless the buyer seasonably notifies the seller.

B. Subject to the provisions of sections 47-2603 and 47-2604 on rejected goods:

1. After rejection any exercise of ownership by the buyer with respect to any commercial unit is wrongful as against the seller; and

2. If the buyer has before rejection taken physical possession of goods in which he does not have a security interest under the provisions of this chapter (subsection C of section 47-2711), he is under a duty after rejection to hold them with reasonable care at the seller's disposition for a time sufficient to permit the seller to remove them; but

3. The buyer has no further obligations with regard to goods rightfully rejected.

C. The seller's rights with respect to goods wrongfully rejected are governed by the provisions of this chapter on seller's remedies in general (section 47-2703).

#### Section 47-2603. Merchant buyer's duties as to rightfully rejected goods

A. Subject to any security interest in the buyer (subsection C of section 47-2711), when the seller has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection a merchant buyer is under a duty after rejection of goods in his possession or control to follow any reasonable instructions received from the seller with respect to the goods and in the absence of such instructions to make reasonable efforts to sell them for the seller's account if they are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.

B. When the buyer sells goods under subsection A of this section, he is entitled to reimbursement from the seller or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and selling them, and if the expenses include no selling commission then to such commission as is usual in the trade or if there is none to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten per cent on the gross proceeds.

C. In complying with this section the buyer is held only to good faith and good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance nor conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.

#### Section 47-2604. Buyer's options as to salvage of rightfully rejected goods

Subject to the provisions of section 47-2603 on perishables if the seller gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection the buyer may store the rejected goods for the seller's account or reship them to him or resell them for the seller's account with reimbursement as provided in section 47-2603. Such action is not acceptance or conversion.

#### Section 47-2605. Waiver of buyer's objections by failure to particularize

A. The buyer's failure to state in connection with rejection a particular defect which is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes him from relying on the unstated defect to justify rejection or to establish breach:

1. Where the seller could have cured it if stated seasonably; or

2. Between merchants when the seller has after rejection made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the buyer proposes to rely.

B. Payment against documents made without reservation of rights precludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent in the documents.

 

#### Section 47-2606. What constitutes acceptance of goods

A. Acceptance of goods occurs when the buyer:

1. After a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods signifies to the seller that the goods are conforming or that he will take or retain them in spite of their non-conformity; or

2. Fails to make an effective rejection (subsection A of section 47-2602), but such acceptance does not occur until the buyer has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect them; or

3. Does any act inconsistent with the seller's ownership; but if such act is wrongful as against the seller it is an acceptance only if ratified by him.

B. Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit.

#### Section 47-2607. Effect of acceptance; notice of breach; burden of establishing breach after acceptance; notice of claim or litigation to person answerable over

A. The buyer must pay at the contract rate for any goods accepted.

B. Acceptance of goods by the buyer precludes rejection of the goods accepted and if made with knowledge of a non-conformity cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the non-conformity would be seasonably cured but acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this chapter for non-conformity.

C. Where a tender has been accepted:

1. The buyer must within a reasonable time after he discovers or should have discovered any breach notify the seller of breach or be barred from any remedy; and

2. If the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection C of section 47-2312) and the buyer is sued as a result of such a breach he must so notify the seller within a reasonable time after he receives notice of the litigation or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation.

D. The burden is on the buyer to establish any breach with respect to the goods accepted.

E. Where the buyer is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which his seller is answerable over:

1. He may give his seller written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the seller may come in and defend and that if the seller does not do so he will be bound in any action against him by his buyer by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the seller after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend he is so bound.

2. If the claim is one for infringement or the like (subsection C of section 47-2312) the original seller may demand in writing that his buyer turn over to him control of the litigation including settlement or else be barred from any remedy over and if he also agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the buyer after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the buyer is so barred.

F. The provisions of subsections C, D and E of this section apply to any obligation of a buyer to hold the seller harmless against infringement or the like (subsection C of section 47-2312).

#### Section 47-2608. Revocation of acceptance in whole or in part

A. The buyer may revoke his acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to him if he has accepted it:

1. On the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or

2. Without discovery of such nonconformity if his acceptance was reasonably induced either by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance or by the seller's assurances.

B. Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the buyer discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by their own defects. It is not effective until the buyer notifies the seller of it.

C. A buyer who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if he had rejected them.

D. The provisions of this section do not apply to a new motor vehicle which is subject to the provisions of title 44, chapter 9, article 5.

#### Section 47-2609. Right to adequate assurance of performance

A. A contract for sale imposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired. When reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party the other may in writing demand adequate assurance of due performance and until he receives such assurance may if commercially reasonable suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.

B. Between merchants the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered shall be determined according to commercial standards.

C. Acceptance of any improper delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party's right to demand adequate assurance of future performance.

D. After receipt of a justified demand failure to provide within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days such assurance of due performance as is adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is a repudiation of the contract.

#### Section 47-2610. Anticipatory repudiation

When either party repudiates the contract with respect to a performance not yet due the loss of which will substantially impair the value of the contract to the other, the aggrieved party may:

1. For a commercially reasonable time await performance by the repudiating party; or

2. Resort to any remedy for breach (section 47-2703 or 47-2711), even though he has notified the repudiating party that he would await the latter's performance and has urged retraction; and

3. In either case suspend his own performance or proceed in accordance with the provisions of this chapter on the seller's right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods (section 47-2704).

#### Section 47-2611. Retraction of anticipatory repudiation

A. Until the repudiating party's next performance is due he can retract his repudiation unless the aggrieved party has since the repudiation cancelled or materially changed his position or otherwise indicated that he considers the repudiation final.

B. Retraction may be by any method which clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform, but must include any assurance justifiably demanded under the provisions of this chapter (section 47-2609).

C. Retraction reinstates the repudiating party's rights under the contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation.

#### Section 47-2612. "Installment contract"; breach

A. An "installment contract" is one which requires or authorizes the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the contract contains a clause "each delivery is a separate contract" or its equivalent.

B. The buyer may reject any installment which is non-conforming if the non-conformity substantially impairs the value of that installment and cannot be cured or if the non-conformity is a defect in the required documents; but if the non-conformity does not fall within subsection C and the seller gives adequate assurance of its cure the buyer must accept that installment.

C. Whenever non-conformity or default with respect to one or more installments substantially impairs the value of the whole contract there is a breach of the whole. But the aggrieved party reinstates the contract if he accepts a non-conforming installment without seasonably notifying of cancellation or if he brings an action with respect only to past installments or demands performance as to future installments.

#### Section 47-2613. Casualty to identified goods

Where the contract requires for its performance goods identified when the contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of either party before the risk of loss passes to the buyer, or in a proper case under a "no arrival, no sale" term (section 47-2324) then:

1. If the loss is total the contract is avoided; and

2. If the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as no longer to conform to the contract the buyer may nevertheless demand inspection and at his option either treat the contract as avoided or accept the goods with due allowance from the contract price for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the seller.

#### Section 47-2614. Substituted performance

A. Where without fault of either party the agreed berthing, loading, or unloading facilities fail or an agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, such substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.

B. If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation, the seller may withhold or stop delivery unless the buyer provides a means or manner of payment which is commercially a substantial equivalent. If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the buyer's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.

#### Section 47-2615. Excuse by failure of presupposed conditions

Except so far as a seller may have assumed a greater obligation and subject to section 47-2614 on substituted performance:

1. Delay in delivery or non-delivery in whole or in part by a seller who complies with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section is not a breach of his duty under a contract for sale if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the non-occurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order whether or not it later proves to be invalid.

2. Where the causes mentioned in paragraph 1 of this section affect only a part of the seller's capacity to perform, he must allocate production and deliveries among his customers but may at his option include regular customers not then under contract as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner which is fair and reasonable.

3. The seller must notify the buyer seasonably that there will be delay or non-delivery and, when allocation is required under paragraph 2 of this section, of the estimated quota thus made available for the buyer.

#### Section 47-2616. Procedure on notice claiming excuse

A. Where the buyer receives notification of a material or indefinite delay or an allocation justified under section 47-2615 he may by written notification to the seller as to any delivery concerned, and where the prospective deficiency substantially impairs the value of the whole contract under the provisions of this chapter relating to breach of installment contracts (section 47-2612), then also as to the whole:

1. Terminate and thereby discharge any unexecuted portion of the contract; or

2. Modify the contract by agreeing to take his available quota in substitution.

B. If after receipt of such notification from the seller the buyer fails so to modify the contract within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days the contract lapses with respect to any deliveries affected.

C. The provisions of this section may not be negated by agreement except in so far as the seller has assumed a greater obligation under section 47-2615.

### Article 7 - Remedies

#### Section 47-2701. Remedies for breach of collateral contracts not impaired

Remedies for breach of any obligation or promise collateral or ancillary to a contract for sale are not impaired by the provisions of this chapter.

#### Section 47-2702. Seller's remedies on discovery of buyer's insolvency

A. Where the seller discovers the buyer to be insolvent he may refuse delivery except for cash including payment for all goods theretofore delivered under the contract, and stop delivery under this chapter (section 47-2705).

B. Where the seller discovers that the buyer has received goods on credit while insolvent he may reclaim the goods upon demand made within ten days after the receipt, but if misrepresentation of solvency has been made to the particular seller in writing within three months before delivery the ten-day limitation does not apply. Except as provided in this subsection the seller may not base a right to reclaim goods on the buyer's fraudulent or innocent misrepresentation of solvency or of intent to pay.

C. The seller's right to reclaim under subsection B is subject to the rights of a buyer in ordinary course or other good faith purchaser or lien creditor under this chapter (section 47-2403). Successful reclamation of goods excludes all other remedies with respect to them.

#### Section 47-2703. Seller's remedies in general

Where the buyer wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods or fails to make a payment due on or before delivery or repudiates with respect to a part or the whole, then with respect to any goods directly affected and, if the breach is of the whole contract (section 47-2612), then also with respect to the whole undelivered balance, the aggrieved seller may:

1. Withhold delivery of such goods.

2. Stop delivery by any bailee as hereafter provided (section 47-2705).

3. Proceed under section 47-2704 respecting goods still unidentified to the contract.

4. Resell and recover damages as hereafter provided (section 47-2706).

5. Recover damages for non-acceptance (section 47-2708) or in a proper case the price (section 47-2709).

6. Cancel.

#### Section 47-2704. Seller's right to identify goods to the contract notwithstanding breach or to salvage unfinished goods

A. An aggrieved seller under section 47-2708 may:

1. Identify to the contract conforming goods not already identified if at the time he learned of the breach they are in his possession or control.

2. Treat as the subject of resale goods which have demonstrably been intended for the particular contract even though those goods are unfinished.

B. Where the goods are unfinished an aggrieved seller may in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment for the purposes of avoiding loss and of effective realization either complete the manufacture and wholly identify the goods to the contract or cease manufacture and resell for scrap or salvage value or proceed in any other reasonable manner.

#### Section 47-2705. Seller's stoppage of delivery in transit or otherwise

A. The seller may stop delivery of goods in the possession of a carrier or other bailee when he discovers the buyer to be insolvent (section 47-2702) and may stop delivery of carload, truckload, planeload or larger shipments of express or freight when the buyer repudiates or fails to make a payment due before delivery or if for any other reason the seller has a right to withhold or reclaim the goods.

B. As against such buyer the seller may stop delivery until:

1. Receipt of the goods by the buyer; or

2. Acknowledgment to the buyer by any bailee of the goods except a carrier that the bailee holds the goods for the buyer; or

3. Such acknowledgment to the buyer by a carrier by reshipment or as a warehouse; or

4. Negotiation to the buyer of any negotiable document of title covering the goods.

C. To stop delivery the seller must so notify as to enable the bailee by reasonable diligence to prevent delivery of the goods.

D. After such notification the bailee must hold and deliver the goods according to the directions of the seller but the seller is liable to the bailee for any ensuing charges or damages.

E. If a negotiable document of title has been issued for goods the bailee is not obliged to obey a notification to stop until surrender of possession or control of the document.

F. A carrier who has issued a nonnegotiable bill of lading is not obliged to obey a notification to stop received from a person other than the consignor.

 

#### Section 47-2706. Seller's resale including contract for resale

A. Under the conditions stated in section 47-2703 on seller's remedies, the seller may resell the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof. Where the resale is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner the seller may recover the difference between the resale price and the contract price together with any incidental damages allowed under the provisions of this chapter (section 47-2710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach.

B. Except as otherwise provided in subsection C of this section or unless otherwise agreed resale may be at public or private sale including sale by way of one or more contracts to sell or of identification to an existing contract of the seller. Sale may be as a unit or in parcels and at any time and place and on any terms but every aspect of the sale including the method, manner, time, place and terms must be commercially reasonable. The resale must be reasonably identified as referring to the broken contract, but it is not necessary that the goods be in existence or that any or all of them have been identified to the contract before the breach.

C. Where the resale is at private sale the seller must give the buyer reasonable notification of his intention to resell.

D. Where the resale is at public sale:

1. Only identified goods can be sold except where there is a recognized market for a public sale of futures in goods of the kind; and

2. It must be made at a usual place or market for public sale if one is reasonably available and except in the case of goods which are perishable or threaten to decline in value speedily the seller must give the buyer reasonable notice of the time and place of the resale; and

3. If the goods are not to be within the view of those attending the sale the notification of sale must state the place where the goods are located and provide for their reasonable inspection by prospective bidders; and

4. The seller may buy.

E. A purchaser who buys in good faith at a resale takes the goods free of any rights of the original buyer even though the seller fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this section.

F. The seller is not accountable to the buyer for any profit made on any resale. A person in the position of a seller (section 47-2707) or a buyer who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance must account for any excess over the amount of his security interest, as hereinafter defined (subsection C of section 47-2711).

#### Section 47-2707. "Person in the position of a seller"

A. A "person in the position of a seller" includes as against a principal an agent who has paid or become responsible for the price of goods on behalf of his principal or anyone who otherwise holds a security interest or other right in goods similar to that of a seller.

B. A person in the position of a seller may as provided in this chapter withhold or stop delivery (section 47-2705) and resell (section 47-2706) and recover incidental damages (section 47-2710).

#### Section 47-2708. Seller's damages for non-acceptance or repudiation

A. Subject to subsection B of this section and to the provisions of this chapter with respect to proof of market price (section 47-2723), the measure of damages for non-acceptance or repudiation by the buyer is the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the unpaid contract price together with any incidental damages provided in this chapter (section 47-2710), but less expenses saved in consequence of the buyer's breach.

B. If the measure of damages provided in subsection A of this section is inadequate to put the seller in as good a position as performance would have done then the measure of damages is the profit (including reasonable overhead) which the seller would have made from full performance by the buyer, together with any incidental damages provided in this chapter (section 47-2710), due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of resale.

#### Section 47-2709. Action for the price

A. When the buyer fails to pay the price as it becomes due the seller may recover, together with any incidental damages under the next section, the price:

1. Of goods accepted or of conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of their loss has passed to the buyer; and

2. Of goods identified to the contract if the seller is unable after reasonable effort to resell them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing.

B. Where the seller sues for the price he must hold for the buyer any goods which have been identified to the contract and are still in his control except that if resale becomes possible he may resell them at any time prior to the collection of the judgment. The net proceeds of any such resale must be credited to the buyer and payment of the judgment entitles him to any goods not resold.

C. After the buyer has wrongfully rejected or revoked acceptance of the goods or has failed to make a payment due or has repudiated (section 47-2610), a seller who is held not entitled to the price under this section shall nevertheless be awarded damages for non-acceptance under section 47-2708.

#### Section 47-2710. Seller's incidental damages

Incidental damages to an aggrieved seller include any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions incurred in stopping delivery, in the transportation, care and custody of goods after the buyer's breach, in connection with return or resale of the goods or otherwise resulting from the breach.

#### Section 47-2711. Buyer's remedies in general; buyer's security interest in rejected goods

A. Where the seller fails to make delivery or repudiates or the buyer rightfully rejects or justifiably revokes acceptance then with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to the whole if the breach goes to the whole contract (section 47-2612), the buyer may cancel and whether or not he has done so may in addition to recovering so much of the price as has been paid:

1. "Cover" and have damages under section 47-2712 as to all the goods affected whether or not they have been identified to the contract; or

2. Recover damages for non-delivery as provided in this chapter (section 47-2713).

B. Where the seller fails to deliver or repudiates the buyer may also:

1. If the goods have been identified recover them as provided in this chapter (section 47-2502); or

2. In a proper case obtain specific performance or replevy the goods as provided in this chapter (section 47-2716).

C. On rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance a buyer has a security interest in goods in his possession or control for any payments made on their price and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, care and custody and may hold such goods and resell them in like manner as an aggrieved seller (section 47-2706).

#### Section 47-2712. "Cover"; buyer's procurement of substitute goods

A. After a breach within section 47-2711 the buyer may "cover" by making in good faith and without unreasonable delay any reasonable purchase of or contract to purchase goods in substitution for those due from the seller.

B. The buyer may recover from the seller as damages the difference between the cost of cover and the contract price together with any incidental or consequential damages as hereinafter defined (section 47-2715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller's breach.

C. Failure of the buyer to effect cover within this section does not bar him from any other remedy.

#### Section 47-2713. Buyer's damages for non-delivery or repudiation

A. Subject to the provisions of this chapter with respect to proof of market price (section 47-2723), the measure of damages for non-delivery or repudiation by the seller is the difference between the market price at the time when the buyer learned of the breach and the contract price together with any incidental and consequential damages provided in this chapter (section 47-2715), but less expenses saved in consequence of the seller's breach.

B. Market price is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.

#### Section 47-2714. Buyer's damages for breach in regard to accepted goods

A. Where the buyer has accepted goods and given notification (subsection C of section 47-2607) he may recover as damages for any non-conformity of tender the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the seller's breach as determined in any manner which is reasonable.

B. The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.

C. In a proper case any incidental and consequential damages under section 47-2715 may also be recovered.

#### Section 47-2715. Buyer's incidental and consequential damages

A. Incidental damages resulting from the seller's breach include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions in connection with effecting cover and any other reasonable expense incident to the delay or other breach.

B. Consequential damages resulting from the seller's breach include:

1. Any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the seller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and

2. Injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.

#### Section 47-2716. Buyer's right to specific performance or replevin

A. Specific performance may be decreed where the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances.

B. The decree for specific performance may include such terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court may deem just.

C. The buyer has a right of replevin for goods identified to the contract if after reasonable effort he is unable to effect cover for such goods or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing or if the goods have been shipped under reservation and satisfaction of the security interest in them has been made or tendered. In the case of goods bought for personal, family or household purposes, the buyer's right of replevin vests on acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver.

#### Section 47-2717. Deduction of damages from the price

The buyer on notifying the seller of his intention to do so may deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any breach of the contract from any part of the price still due under the same contract.

#### Section 47-2718. Liquidation or limitation of damages; deposits

A. Damages for breach by either party may be liquidated in the agreement but only at an amount which is reasonable in the light of the anticipated or actual harm caused by the breach, the difficulties of proof of loss, and the inconvenience or non-feasibility of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy. A term fixing unreasonably large liquidated damages is void as a penalty.

B. Where the seller justifiably withholds delivery of goods because of the buyer's breach, the buyer is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds:

1. The amount to which the seller is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the seller's damages in accordance with subsection A of this section, or

2. In the absence of such terms, twenty per cent of the value of the total performance for which the buyer is obligated under the contract or five hundred dollars, whichever is smaller.

C. The buyer's right to restitution under subsection B of this section is subject to offset to the extent that the seller establishes:

1. A right to recover damages under the provisions of this chapter other than subsection A of this section, and

2. The amount or value of any benefits received by the buyer directly or indirectly by reason of the contract.

D. Where a seller has received payment in goods their reasonable value or the proceeds of their resale shall be treated as payments for the purposes of subsection B of this section; but if the seller has notice of the buyer's breach before reselling goods received in part performance, his resale is subject to the conditions laid down in this chapter on resale by an aggrieved seller (section 47-2706).

#### Section 47-2719. Contractual modification or limitation of remedy

A. Subject to the provisions of subsections B and C of this section and of section 47-2718 on liquidation and limitation of damages:

1. The agreement may provide for remedies in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this chapter and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this chapter, as by limiting the buyer's remedies to return of the goods and repayment of the price or to repair and replacement of non-conforming goods or parts; and

2. Resort to a remedy as provided is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive, in which case it is the sole remedy.

B. Where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this title.

C. Consequential damages may be limited or excluded unless the limitation or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation of damages where the loss is commercial is not.

#### Section 47-2720. Effect of "cancellation" or "rescission" on claims for antecedent breach

Unless the contrary intention clearly appears, expressions of "cancellation" or "rescission" of the contract or the like shall not be construed as a renunciation or discharge of any claim in damages for an antecedent breach.

#### Section 47-2721. Remedies for fraud

Remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include all remedies available under this chapter for non-fraudulent breach. Neither rescission or a claim for rescission of the contract for sale nor rejection or return of the goods shall bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other remedy.

#### Section 47-2722. Who can sue third parties for injury to goods

Where a third party so deals with goods which have been identified to a contract for sale as to cause actionable injury to a party to that contract:

1. A right of action against the third party is in either party to the contract for sale who has title to or a security interest or a special property or an insurable interest in the goods; and if the goods have been destroyed or converted a right of action is also in the party who either bore the risk of loss under the contract for sale or has since the injury assumed that risk as against the other;

2. If at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not bear the risk of loss as against the other party to the contract for sale and there is no arrangement between them for disposition of the recovery, his suit or settlement is, subject to his own interest, as a fiduciary for the other party to the contract;

3. Either party may with the consent of the other sue for the benefit of whom it may concern.

#### Section 47-2723. Proof of market price: time and place

A. If an action based on anticipatory repudiation comes to trial before the time for performance with respect to some or all of the goods, any damages based on market price (section 47-2708 or 47-2713) shall be determined according to the price of such goods prevailing at the time when the aggrieved party learned of the repudiation.

B. If evidence of a price prevailing at the times or places described in this chapter is not readily available the price prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the cost of transporting the goods to or from such other place.

C. Evidence of a relevant price prevailing at a time or place other than the one described in this chapter offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he has given the other party such notice as the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.

#### Section 47-2724. Admissibility of market quotations

Whenever the prevailing price or value of any goods regularly bought and sold in any established commodity market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of such market shall be admissible in evidence. The circumstances of the preparation of such a report may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility.

#### Section 47-2725. Statute of limitations in contracts for sale

A. An action for breach of any contract for sale must be commenced within four years after the cause of action has accrued. By the original agreement the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year but may not extend it.

B. A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party's lack of knowledge of the breach. A breach of warranty occurs when tender of delivery is made, except that where a warranty explicitly extends to future performance of the goods and discovery of the breach must await the time of such performance the cause of action accrues when the breach is or should have been discovered.

C. Where an action commenced within the time limited by subsection A is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same breach such other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six months after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.

D. This section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does it apply to causes of action which have accrued before January 1, 1968.

#### Section 47-2A105. Territorial application of chapter to goods covered by certificate of title

Subject to the provisions of section 47-2A304, subsection C and section 47-2A305, subsection C, with respect to goods covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this state or of another jurisdiction, compliance and the effect of compliance or noncompliance with a certificate of title statute are governed by the law, including the conflict of laws rules, of the jurisdiction issuing the certificate until the earlier of surrender of the certificate or four months after the goods are removed from that jurisdiction and thereafter until a new certificate of title is issued by another jurisdiction.

#### Section 47-2A106. Limitation on power of parties to consumer lease to choose applicable law and judicial forum

A. If the law chosen by the parties to a consumer lease is that of a jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in which the lessee resides at the time the lease agreement becomes enforceable or within thirty days thereafter or in which the goods are to be used, the choice is not enforceable.

B. If the judicial forum chosen by the parties to a consumer lease is a forum that would not otherwise have jurisdiction over the lessee, the choice is not enforceable.

#### Section 47-2A107. Waiver or renunciation of claim or right after default

Any claim or right arising out of an alleged default or breach of warranty may be discharged in whole or in part without consideration by a written waiver or renunciation signed and delivered by the aggrieved party.

#### Section 47-2A108. Unconscionability

A. If the court as a matter of law finds a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract to have been unconscionable at the time it was made the court may refuse to enforce the lease contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the lease contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.

B. With respect to a consumer lease, if the court as a matter of law finds that a lease contract or any clause of a lease contract has been induced by unconscionable conduct or that unconscionable conduct has occurred in the collection of a claim arising from a lease contract, the court may grant appropriate relief.

C. Before making a finding of unconscionability under subsection A or B, the court, on its own motion or that of a party, shall afford the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence as to the setting, purpose and effect of the lease contract or clause thereof, or of the conduct.

D. In an action in which the lessee claims unconscionability with respect to a consumer lease:

1. If the court finds unconscionability under subsection A or B, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the lessee.

2. If the court does not find unconscionability and the lessee claiming unconscionability has brought or maintained an action he or she knew to be groundless, the court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the party against whom the claim is made.

3. In determining attorney fees, the amount of the recovery on behalf of the claimant under subsections A and B is not controlling.

#### Section 47-2A109. Option to accelerate at will

A. A term providing that one party or his successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral "at will" or "when he deems himself insecure" or in words of similar import must be construed to mean that he has power to do so only if he in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired.

B. With respect to a consumer lease, the burden of establishing good faith under subsection A is on the party who exercised the power. Otherwise the burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against whom the power has been exercised.

### Article 2 - Formation and Construction of Lease Contract

#### Section 47-2A201. Statute of frauds

A. A lease contract is not enforceable by way of action or defense unless:

1. The total payments to be made under the lease contract, excluding payments for options to renew or buy, are less than one thousand dollars; or

2. There is a writing, signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent, sufficient to indicate that a lease contract has been made between the parties and to describe the goods leased and the lease term.

B. Any description of leased goods or of the lease term is sufficient and satisfies subsection A, paragraph 2, whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described.

C. A writing is not insufficient because it omits or incorrectly states a term agreed upon, but the lease contract is not enforceable under subsection A, paragraph 2 beyond the lease term and the quantity of goods shown in the writing.

D. A lease contract that does not satisfy the requirements of subsection A, but which is valid in other respects, is enforceable:

1. If the goods are to be specially manufactured or obtained for the lessee and are not suitable for lease or sale to others in the ordinary course of the lessor's business, and the lessor, before notice of repudiation is received and under circumstances that reasonably indicate that the goods are for the lessee, has made either a substantial beginning of their manufacture or commitments for their procurement;

2. If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony or otherwise in court that a lease contract was made, but the lease contract is not enforceable under this provision beyond the quantity of goods admitted; or

3. With respect to goods that have been received and accepted by the lessee.

E. The lease term under a lease contract referred to in subsection D is:

1. If there is a writing signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought or by that party's authorized agent specifying the lease term, the term so specified;

2. If the party against whom enforcement is sought admits in that party's pleading, testimony or otherwise in court a lease term, the term so admitted; or

3. A reasonable lease term.

#### Section 47-2A202. Final written expression; parol or extrinsic evidence

Terms with respect to which the confirmatory memoranda of the parties agree or which are otherwise set forth in a writing intended by the parties as a final expression of their agreement with respect to such terms as are included therein may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or of a contemporaneous oral agreement but may be explained or supplemented:

1. By course of dealing or usage of trade or by course of performance; and

2. By evidence of consistent additional terms unless the court finds the writing to have been intended also as a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement.

#### Section 47-2A203. Seals inoperative

The affixing of a seal to a writing evidencing a lease contract or an offer to enter into a lease contract does not render the writing a sealed instrument and the law with respect to sealed instruments does not apply to the lease contract or offer.

#### Section 47-2A204. Formation in general

A. A lease contract may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of a lease contract.

B. An agreement sufficient to constitute a lease contract may be found although the moment of its making is undetermined.

C. Although one or more terms are left open, a lease contract does not fail for indefiniteness if the parties have intended to make a lease contract and there is a reasonably certain basis for giving an appropriate remedy.

#### Section 47-2A205. Firm offers

An offer by a merchant to lease goods to or from another person in a signed writing that by its terms gives assurance it will be held open is not revocable, for lack of consideration, during the time stated or, if no time is stated, for a reasonable time, but in no event may the period of irrevocability exceed three months. Any such term of assurance on a form supplied by the offeree must be separately signed by the offeror.

#### Section 47-2A206. Offer and acceptance in formation of lease contract

A. Unless otherwise unambiguously indicated by the language or circumstances, an offer to make a lease contract must be construed as inviting acceptance in any manner and by any medium reasonable in the circumstances.

B. If the beginning of a requested performance is a reasonable mode of acceptance, an offeror who is not notified of acceptance within a reasonable time may treat the offer as having lapsed before acceptance.

#### Section 47-2A208. Modification, rescission and waiver

A. An agreement modifying a lease contract needs no consideration to be binding.

B. A signed lease agreement that excludes modification or rescission except by a signed writing may not be otherwise modified or rescinded, but, except as between merchants, such a requirement on a form supplied by a merchant must be separately signed by the other party.

C. Although an attempt at modification or rescission does not satisfy the requirements of subsection B, it may operate as a waiver.

D. A party who has made a waiver affecting an executory portion of a lease contract may retract the waiver by reasonable notification received by the other party that strict performance will be required of any term waived, unless the retraction would be unjust in view of a material change of position in reliance on the waiver.

#### Section 47-2A209. Lessee under finance lease as beneficiary of supply contract

A. The benefit of a supplier's promises to the lessor under the supply contract and of all warranties, whether express or implied, including those of any third party provided in connection with or as part of the supply contract, extends to the lessee to the extent of the lessee's leasehold interest under a finance lease related to the supply contract, but is subject to the terms of the warranty and of the supply contract and all defenses or claims arising therefrom.

B. The extension of the benefit of a supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee (subsection A) does not:

1. Modify the rights and obligations of the parties to the supply contract, whether arising therefrom or otherwise; or

2. Impose any duty or liability under the supply contract on the lessee.

C. Any modification or rescission of the supply contract by the supplier and the lessor is effective between the supplier and the lessee unless, before the modification or rescission, the supplier has received notice that the lessee has entered into a finance lease related to the supply contract. If the modification or rescission is effective between the supplier and the lessee, the lessor is deemed to have assumed, in addition to the obligations of the lessor to the lessee under the lease contract, promises of the supplier to the lessor and warranties that were so modified or rescinded as they existed and were available to the lessee before modification or rescission.

D. In addition to the extension of the benefit of the supplier's promises and of warranties to the lessee under subsection A, the lessee retains all rights that the lessee may have against the supplier which arise from an agreement between the lessee and the supplier or under other law.

#### Section 47-2A210. Express warranties

A. Express warranties by the lessor are created as follows:

1. Any affirmation of fact or promise made by the lessor to the lessee which relates to the goods and becomes part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the affirmation or promise.

2. Any description of the goods which is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the goods will conform to the description.

3. Any sample or model that is made part of the basis of the bargain creates an express warranty that the whole of the goods will conform to the sample or model.

B. It is not necessary to the creation of an express warranty that the lessor use formal words, such as "warrant" or "guarantee", or that the lessor have a specific intention to make a warranty, but an affirmation merely of the value of the goods or a statement purporting to be merely the lessor's opinion or commendation of the goods does not create a warranty.

#### Section 47-2A211. Warranties against interference and against infringement; lessee's obligation against infringement

A. There is in a lease contract a warranty that for the lease term no person holds a claim to or interest in the goods that arose from an act or omission of the lessor, other than a claim by way of infringement or the like, which will interfere with the lessee's enjoyment of its leasehold interest.

B. Except in a finance lease there is in a lease contract by a lessor who is a merchant regularly dealing in goods of the kind a warranty that the goods are delivered free of the rightful claim of any person by way of infringement or the like.

C. A lessee who furnishes specifications to a lessor or a supplier shall hold the lessor and the supplier harmless against any claim by way of infringement or the like that arises out of compliance with the specifications.

#### Section 47-2A212. Implied warranty of merchantability

A. Except in a finance lease, a warranty that the goods will be merchantable is implied in a lease contract if the lessor is a merchant with respect to goods of that kind.

B. Goods to be merchantable must be at least such as:

1. Pass without objection in the trade under the description in the lease agreement;

2. In the case of fungible goods, are of fair average quality within the description;

3. Are fit for the ordinary purposes for which goods of that type are used;

4. Run, within the variation permitted by the lease agreement, of even kind, quality and quantity within each unit and among all units involved;

5. Are adequately contained, packaged and labeled as the lease agreement may require; and

6. Conform to any promises or affirmations of fact made on the container or label.

C. Other implied warranties may arise from course of dealing or usage of trade.

#### Section 47-2A213. Implied warranty of fitness for particular purpose

Except in a finance lease, if the lessor at the time the lease contract is made has reason to know of any particular purpose for which the goods are required and that the lessee is relying on the lessor's skill or judgment to select or furnish suitable goods, there is in the lease contract an implied warranty that the goods will be fit for that purpose.

 

#### Section 47-2A214. Exclusion or modification of warranties

A. Words or conduct relevant to the creation of an express warranty and words or conduct tending to negate or limit a warranty must be construed wherever reasonable as consistent with each other, but, subject to the provisions of section 47-2A202 on parol or extrinsic evidence, negation or limitation is inoperative to the extent that the construction is unreasonable.

B. Subject to subsection C of this section, to exclude or modify the implied warranty of merchantability or any part of it the language must mention "merchantability", be by a writing and be conspicuous. Subject to subsection C of this section, to exclude or modify any implied warranty of fitness the exclusion must be by a writing and be conspicuous. Language to exclude all implied warranties of fitness is sufficient if it is in writing, is conspicuous and states, for example, "There is no warranty that the goods will be fit for a particular purpose".

C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, but subject to subsection D of this section:

1. Unless the circumstances indicate otherwise, all implied warranties are excluded by expressions like "as is", or "with all faults", or by other language that in common understanding calls the lessee's attention to the exclusion of warranties and makes plain that there is no implied warranty, if in writing and conspicuous;

2. If the lessee before entering into the lease contract has examined the goods or the sample or model as fully as desired or has refused to examine the goods, there is no implied warranty with regard to defects that an examination ought in the circumstances to have revealed; and

3. An implied warranty may also be excluded or modified by course of dealing, course of performance or usage of trade.

D. To exclude or modify a warranty against interference or against infringement (section 47-2A211) or any part of it, the language must be specific, be by a writing and be conspicuous, unless the circumstances, including course of performance, course of dealing or usage of trade, give the lessee reason to know that the goods are being leased subject to a claim or interest of any person.

#### Section 47-2A215. Cumulation and conflict of warranties express or implied

Warranties, whether express or implied, must be construed as consistent with each other and as cumulative, but if that construction is unreasonable, the intention of the parties determines which warranty is dominant. In ascertaining that intention the following rules apply:

1. Exact or technical specifications displace an inconsistent sample or model or general language of description.

2. A sample from an existing bulk displaces inconsistent general language of description.

3. Express warranties displace inconsistent implied warranties other than an implied warranty of fitness for a particular purpose.

#### Section 47-2A216. Third-party beneficiaries of express and implied warranties

A warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee under this chapter, whether express or implied, extends to any natural person who is in the family or household of the lessee or who is a guest in the lessee's home if it is reasonable to expect that such person may use, consume or be affected by the goods and who is injured in person by breach of the warranty. This section does not displace principles of law and equity that extend a warranty to or for the benefit of a lessee to other persons. The operation of this section may not be excluded, modified or limited, but an exclusion, modification or limitation of the warranty, including any with respect to rights and remedies, effective against the lessee is also effective against any beneficiary designated under this section.

#### Section 47-2A217. Identification

Identification of goods as goods to which a lease contract refers may be made at any time and in any manner explicitly agreed to by the parties. In the absence of explicit agreement, identification occurs:

1. When the lease contract is made if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are existing and identified;

2. When the goods are shipped, marked or otherwise designated by the lessor as goods to which the lease contract refers, if the lease contract is for a lease of goods that are not existing and identified; or

3. When the young are conceived, if the lease contract is for a lease of unborn young of animals.

#### Section 47-2A218. Insurance and proceeds

A. A lessee obtains an insurable interest when existing goods are identified to the lease contract even though the goods identified are nonconforming and the lessee has an option to reject them.

B. If a lessee has an insurable interest only by reason of the lessor's identification of the goods, the lessor, until default or insolvency or notification to the lessee that identification is final, may substitute other goods for those identified.

C. Notwithstanding a lessee's insurable interest under subsections A and B, the lessor retains an insurable interest until an option to buy has been exercised by the lessee and risk of loss has passed to the lessee.

D. Nothing in this section impairs any insurable interest recognized under any other statute or rule of law.

E. The parties by agreement may determine that one or more parties have an obligation to obtain and pay for insurance covering the goods and by agreement may determine the beneficiary of the proceeds of the insurance.

#### Section 47-2A219. Risk of loss

A. Except in the case of a finance lease, risk of loss is retained by the lessor and does not pass to the lessee. In the case of a finance lease, risk of loss passes to the lessee.

B. Subject to the provisions of this chapter on the effect of default on risk of loss (section 47-2A220), if risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated, the following rules apply:

1. If the lease contract requires or authorizes the goods to be shipped by carrier and it does not require delivery at a particular destination, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are duly delivered to the carrier, but if it does require delivery at a particular destination and the goods are there duly tendered while in the possession of the carrier, the risk of loss passes to the lessee when the goods are there duly so tendered as to enable the lessee to take delivery.

2. If the goods are held by a bailee to be delivered without being moved, the risk of loss passes to the lessee on acknowledgment by the bailee of the lessee's right to possession of the goods.

3. In any case not within paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection, the risk of loss passes to the lessee on the lessee's receipt of the goods if the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, is a merchant. Otherwise the risk passes to the lessee on tender of delivery.

C. Notwithstanding subsections A and B of this section, the parties to the lease may determine the risk of loss by written agreement.

#### Section 47-2A220. Effect of default on risk of loss

A. Where risk of loss is to pass to the lessee and the time of passage is not stated:

1. If a tender or delivery of goods so fails to conform to the lease contract as to give a right of rejection, the risk of their loss remains with the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, until cure or acceptance.

2. If the lessee rightfully revokes acceptance, he, to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage, may treat the risk of loss as having remained with the lessor from the beginning.

B. Whether or not risk of loss is to pass to the lessee, if the lessee as to conforming goods already identified to a lease contract repudiates or is otherwise in default under the lease contract, the lessor, or, in the case of a finance lease, the supplier, to the extent of any deficiency in his effective insurance coverage may treat the risk of loss as resting on the lessee for a commercially reasonable time.

#### Section 47-2A221. Casualty to identified goods

If a lease contract requires goods identified when the lease contract is made, and the goods suffer casualty without fault of the lessee, the lessor or the supplier before delivery, or the goods suffer casualty before risk of loss passes to the lessee pursuant to the lease agreement or section 47-2A219, then:

1. If the loss is total, the lease contract is avoided; and

2. If the loss is partial or the goods have so deteriorated as to no longer conform to the lease contract, the lessee may nevertheless demand inspection and at his option either treat the lease contract as avoided or, except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, accept the goods with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deterioration or the deficiency in quantity but without further right against the lessor.

### Article 3 - Effect of Lease Contract

#### Section 47-2A301. Enforceability of lease contract

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a lease contract is effective and enforceable according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the goods and against creditors of the parties.

#### Section 47-2A302. Title to and possession of goods

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each provision of this chapter applies whether the lessor or a third party has title to the goods, and whether the lessor, the lessee or a third party has possession of the goods, notwithstanding any statute or rule of law that possession or the absence of possession is fraudulent.

#### Section 47-2A303. Alienability of party's interest under lease contract or of lessor's residual interest in goods; delegation of performance; transfer of rights

A. As used in this section, "creation of a security interest" includes the sale of a lease contract that is subject to chapter 9 of this title, secured transactions, by reason of section 47-9109, subsection A, paragraph 3.

B. Except as provided in subsection C of this section and section 47-9407, a provision in a lease agreement which prohibits the voluntary or involuntary transfer, including a transfer by sale, sublease, creation or enforcement of a security interest, or attachment, levy or other judicial process, of an interest of a party under the lease contract or of the lessor's residual interest in the goods, or makes such a transfer an event of default, gives rise to the rights and remedies provided in subsection D of this section, but a transfer that is prohibited or is an event of default under the lease agreement is otherwise effective.

C. A provision in a lease agreement which prohibits a transfer of a right to damages for default with respect to the whole lease contract or of a right to payment arising out of the transferor's due performance of the transferor's entire obligation, or makes such a transfer an event of default, is not enforceable, and such a transfer is not a transfer that materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract within the purview of subsection D of this section.

D. Subject to subsection C of this section and section 47-9407:

1. If a transfer is made which is made an event of default under a lease agreement, the party to the lease contract not making the transfer, unless that party waives the default or otherwise agrees, has the rights and remedies described in section 47-2A501, subsection B;

2. If paragraph 1 of this subsection is not applicable and if a transfer is made that is prohibited under a lease agreement or materially impairs the prospect of obtaining return performance by, materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on, the other party to the lease contract, unless the party not making the transfer agrees at any time to the transfer in the lease contract or otherwise, then, except as limited by contract, the transferor is liable to the party not making the transfer for damages caused by the transfer to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the party not making the transfer and a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the lease contract or an injunction against the transfer.

E. A transfer of "the lease" or of "all my rights under the lease", or a transfer in similar general terms, is a transfer of rights and, unless the language or the circumstances, as in a transfer for security, indicate the contrary, the transfer is a delegation of duties by the transferor to the transferee. Acceptance by the transferee constitutes a promise by the transferee to perform those duties. The promise is enforceable by either the transferor or the other party to the lease contract.

F. Unless otherwise agreed by the lessor and the lessee, a delegation of performance does not relieve the transferor as against the other party of any duty to perform or of any liability for default.

G. In a consumer lease, to prohibit the transfer of an interest of a party under the lease contract or to make a transfer an event of default, the language must be specific, by a writing, and conspicuous.

#### Section 47-2A304. Subsequent lease of goods by lessor

A. Subject to section 47-2A303, a subsequent lessee from a lessor of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessor had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection B of this section and section 47-2A527, subsection D, takes subject to the existing lease contract. A lessor with voidable title has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith subsequent lessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. If goods have been delivered under a transaction of purchase, the lessor has that power even though:

1. The lessor's transferor was deceived as to the identity of the lessor;

2. The delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored;

3. It was agreed that the transaction was to be a "cash sale"; or

4. The delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.

B. A subsequent lessee in the ordinary course of business from a lessor who is a merchant dealing in goods of that kind to whom the goods were entrusted by the existing lessee of that lessor before the interest of the subsequent lessee became enforceable against that lessor obtains, to the extent of the leasehold interest transferred, all of that lessor's and the existing lessee's rights to the goods, and takes free of the existing lease contract.

C. A subsequent lessee from the lessor of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this state or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute.

#### Section 47-2A305. Sale or sublease of goods by lessee

A. Subject to the provisions of section 47-2A303, a buyer or sublessee from the lessee of goods under an existing lease contract obtains, to the extent of the interest transferred, the leasehold interest in the goods that the lessee had or had power to transfer, and except as provided in subsection B of this section and section 47-2A511, subsection D, takes subject to the existing lease contract. A lessee with a voidable leasehold interest has power to transfer a good leasehold interest to a good faith buyer for value or a good faith sublessee for value, but only to the extent set forth in the preceding sentence. When goods have been delivered under a transaction of lease the lessee has that power even though:

1. The lessor was deceived as to the identity of the lessee;

2. The delivery was in exchange for a check which is later dishonored; or

3. The delivery was procured through fraud punishable as larcenous under the criminal law.

B. A buyer in the ordinary course of business or a sublessee in the ordinary course of business from a lessee who is a merchant dealing in goods of that kind to whom the goods were entrusted by the lessor obtains, to the extent of the interest transferred, all of the lessor's and lessee's rights to the goods, and takes free of the existing lease contract.

C. A buyer or sublessee from the lessee of goods that are subject to an existing lease contract and are covered by a certificate of title issued under a statute of this State or of another jurisdiction takes no greater rights than those provided both by this section and by the certificate of title statute.

#### Section 47-2A306. Priority of certain liens arising by operation of law

If a person in the ordinary course of his business furnishes services or materials with respect to goods subject to a lease contract, a lien upon those goods in the possession of that person given by statute or rule of law for those materials or services takes priority over any interest of the lessee under the lease contract or this chapter unless the lien is created by statute and the statute provides otherwise or unless the lien is created by rule of law and the rule of law provides otherwise.

#### Section 47-2A307. Priority of liens arising by attachment or levy on, security interests in and other claims to goods

A. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-2A306, a creditor of a lessee takes subject to the lease contract.

B. Except as otherwise provided in subsection C of this section and in sections 47-2A306 and 47-2A308, a creditor of a lessor takes subject to the lease contract unless the creditor holds a lien that attached to the goods before the lease contract became enforceable.

C. Except as otherwise provided in sections 47-9317, 47-9321 and 47-9323, a lessee takes a leasehold interest subject to a security interest held by a creditor of the lessor.

#### Section 47-2A308. Special rights of creditors

A. A creditor of a lessor in possession of goods subject to a lease contract may treat the lease contract as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the lessor is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession in good faith and current course of trade by the lessor for a commercially reasonable time after the lease contract becomes enforceable is not fraudulent.

B. Nothing in this chapter impairs the rights of creditors of a lessor if the lease contract becomes enforceable, not in current course of trade but in satisfaction of or as security for a preexisting claim for money, security or the like, and is made under circumstances which under any statute or rule of law apart from this chapter would constitute the transaction a fraudulent transfer or voidable preference.

C. A creditor of a seller may treat a sale or an identification of goods to a contract for sale as void if as against the creditor retention of possession by the seller is fraudulent under any statute or rule of law, but retention of possession of the goods pursuant to a lease contract entered into by the seller as lessee and the buyer as lessor in connection with the sale or identification of the goods is not fraudulent if the buyer bought for value and in good faith.

#### Section 47-2A309. Lessor's and lessee's rights when goods become fixtures

A. In this section:

1. Goods are "fixtures" when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under real estate law;

2. A "fixture filing" is the filing, in the office where a record of a mortgage on the real estate would be filed or recorded, of a financing statement covering goods that are or are to become fixtures and conforming to the requirements of section 47-9502, subsections A and B;

3. A lease is a "purchase money lease" unless the lessee has possession or use of the goods or the right to possession or use of the goods before the lease agreement is enforceable;

4. A mortgage is a "construction mortgage" to the extent it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land including the acquisition cost of the land, if the recorded writing so indicates; and

5. "Encumbrance" includes real estate mortgages and other liens on real estate and all other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests.

B. Under this article a lease may be of goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this article of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.

C. This article does not prevent creation of a lease of fixtures pursuant to real estate law.

D. The perfected interest of a lessor of fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:

1. The lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, the interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within ten days thereafter, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; or

2. The interest of the lessor is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor's interest has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate.

E. The interest of a lessor of fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if:

1. The fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease, and before the goods become fixtures the lease contract is enforceable;

2. The conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contract is enforceable;

3. The encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or

4. The lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. If the lessee's right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time.

F. Notwithstanding subsection D, paragraph 1 of this section but otherwise subject to subsections D and E of this section, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage.

G. In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate.

H. If the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may on default, expiration, termination or cancellation of the lease agreement but subject to the lease agreement and this chapter, or if necessary to enforce other rights and remedies of the lessor or lessee under this chapter, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but the lessor or lessee must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.

I. Even though the lease agreement does not create a security interest, the interest of a lessor of fixtures, including the lessor's residual interest, is perfected by filing a financing statement as a fixture filing for leased goods that are or are to become fixtures in accordance with the relevant provisions of the chapter on secured transactions (chapter 9 of this title).

#### Section 47-2A310. Lessor's and lessee's rights when goods become accessions

A. Goods are "accessions" when they are installed in or affixed to other goods.

B. The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into before the goods became accessions is superior to all interests in the whole except as stated in subsection D.

C. The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract entered into at the time or after the goods became accessions is superior to all subsequently acquired interests in the whole except as stated in subsection D but is subordinate to interests in the whole existing at the time the lease contract was made unless the holders of such interests in the whole have in writing consented to the lease or disclaimed an interest in the goods as part of the whole.

D. The interest of a lessor or a lessee under a lease contract described in subsection B or C is subordinate to the interest of:

1. A buyer in the ordinary course of business or a lessee in the ordinary course of business of any interest in the whole acquired after the goods became accessions; or

2. A creditor with a security interest in the whole perfected before the lease contract was made to the extent that the creditor makes subsequent advances without knowledge of the lease contract.

E. When under subsection B or subsections C and D a lessor or a lessee of accessions holds an interest that is superior to all interests in the whole, the lessor or the lessee may on default, expiration, termination or cancellation of the lease contract by the other party but subject to the provisions of the lease contract and this chapter, or if necessary to enforce his other rights and remedies under this chapter, remove the goods from the whole, free and clear of all interests in the whole, but he must reimburse any holder of an interest in the whole who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury but not for any diminution in value of the whole caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity for replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation.

#### Section 47-2A311. Priority subject to subordination

Nothing in this article prevents subordination by agreement by any person entitled to priority.

 

### Article 4 - Performance of Lease Contract Repudiated, Substituted and Excused

#### Section 47-2A401. Insecurity; adequate assurance of performance

A. A lease contract imposes an obligation on each party that the other's expectation of receiving due performance will not be impaired.

B. If reasonable grounds for insecurity arise with respect to the performance of either party, the insecure party may demand in writing adequate assurance of due performance. Until the insecure party receives that assurance, if commercially reasonable the insecure party may suspend any performance for which he has not already received the agreed return.

C. A repudiation of the lease contract occurs if assurance of due performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case is not provided to the insecure party within a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days after receipt of a demand by the other party.

D. Between merchants, the reasonableness of grounds for insecurity and the adequacy of any assurance offered must be determined according to commercial standards.

E. Acceptance of any nonconforming delivery or payment does not prejudice the aggrieved party's right to demand adequate assurance of future performance.

#### Section 47-2A402. Anticipatory repudiation

If either party repudiates a lease contract with respect to a performance not yet due under the lease contract, the loss of which performance will substantially impair the value of the lease contract to the other, the aggrieved party may:

1. For a commercially reasonable time, await retraction of repudiation and performance by the repudiating party;

2. Make demand pursuant to section 47-2A401 and await assurance of future performance adequate under the circumstances of the particular case; or

3. Resort to any right or remedy upon default under the lease contract or this article, even though the aggrieved party has notified the repudiating party that the aggrieved party would await the repudiating party's performance and assurance and has urged retraction.

 

In addition, whether or not the aggrieved party is pursuing one of the foregoing remedies, the aggrieved party may suspend performance or, if the aggrieved party is the lessor, proceed in accordance with the provisions of this article on the lessor's right to identify goods to the lease contract notwithstanding default or to salvage unfinished goods (section 47-2A524).

#### Section 47-2A403. Retraction of anticipatory repudiation

A. Until the repudiating party's next performance is due, the repudiating party can retract the repudiation unless, since the repudiation, the aggrieved party has cancelled the lease contract or materially changed the aggrieved party's position or otherwise indicated that the aggrieved party considers the repudiation final.

B. Retraction may be by any method that clearly indicates to the aggrieved party that the repudiating party intends to perform under the lease contract and includes any assurance demanded under section 47-2A401.

C. Retraction reinstates a repudiating party's rights under a lease contract with due excuse and allowance to the aggrieved party for any delay occasioned by the repudiation.

#### Section 47-2A404. Substituted performance

A. If without fault of the lessee, the lessor and the supplier, the agreed berthing, loading or unloading facilities fail or the agreed type of carrier becomes unavailable or the agreed manner of delivery otherwise becomes commercially impracticable, but a commercially reasonable substitute is available, the substitute performance must be tendered and accepted.

B. If the agreed means or manner of payment fails because of domestic or foreign governmental regulation:

1. The lessor may withhold or stop delivery or cause the supplier to withhold or stop delivery unless the lessee provides a means or manner of payment that is commercially a substantial equivalent; and

2. If delivery has already been taken, payment by the means or in the manner provided by the regulation discharges the lessee's obligation unless the regulation is discriminatory, oppressive or predatory.

#### Section 47-2A405. Excused performance

Subject to section 47-2A404 on substituted performance, the following rules apply:

1. Delay in delivery or nondelivery in whole or in part by a lessor or a supplier who complies with paragraphs 2 and 3 of this section is not a default under the lease contract if performance as agreed has been made impracticable by the occurrence of a contingency the nonoccurrence of which was a basic assumption on which the lease contract was made or by compliance in good faith with any applicable foreign or domestic governmental regulation or order, whether or not the regulation or order later proves to be invalid.

2. If the causes mentioned in paragraph 1 of this section affect only part of the lessor's or the supplier's capacity to perform, he shall allocate production and deliveries among his customers but at his option may include regular customers not then under contract for sale or lease as well as his own requirements for further manufacture. He may so allocate in any manner that is fair and reasonable.

3. The lessor seasonably shall notify the lessee and in the case of a finance lease the supplier seasonably shall notify the lessor and the lessee, if known, that there will be delay or nondelivery and, if allocation is required under paragraph 2 of this section, of the estimated quota thus made available for the lessee.

#### Section 47-2A406. Procedure on excused performance

A. If the lessee receives notification of a material or indefinite delay or an allocation justified under section 47-2A405, the lessee may by written notification to the lessor as to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract is substantially impaired (section 47-2A510):

1. Terminate the lease contract (section 47-2A505, subsection B); or

2. Except in a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, modify the lease contract by accepting the available quota in substitution, with due allowance from the rent payable for the balance of the lease term for the deficiency but without further right against the lessor.

B. If, after receipt of a notification from the lessor under section 47-2A405, the lessee fails so to modify the lease agreement within a reasonable time not exceeding thirty days, the lease contract lapses with respect to any deliveries affected.

#### Section 47-2A407. Irrevocable promises; finance leases

A. In the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease the lessee's promises under the lease contract become irrevocable and independent upon the lessee's acceptance of the goods.

B. A promise that has become irrevocable and independent under subsection A:

1. Is effective and enforceable between the parties, and by or against third parties including assignees of the parties; and

2. Is not subject to cancellation, termination, modification, repudiation, excuse or substitution without the consent of the party to whom the promise runs.

C. This section does not affect the validity under any other law of a covenant in any lease contract making the lessee's promises irrevocable and independent upon the lessee's acceptance of the goods.

### Article 5 - Default

#### Section 47-2A501. Default; procedure

A. Whether the lessor or the lessee is in default under a lease contract is determined by the lease agreement and this chapter.

B. If the lessor or the lessee is in default under the lease contract, the party seeking enforcement has rights and remedies as provided in this chapter and, except as limited by this chapter, as provided in the lease agreement.

C. If the lessor or the lessee is in default under the lease contract, the party seeking enforcement may reduce the party's claim to judgment, or otherwise enforce the lease contract by self-help or any available judicial procedure or nonjudicial procedure, including administrative proceeding, arbitration or the like, in accordance with this article.

D. Except as otherwise provided in section  47-1305, subsection A or this chapter or the lease agreement, the rights and remedies referred to in subsections B and C of this section are cumulative.

E. If the lease agreement covers both real property and goods, the party seeking enforcement may proceed under this article as to the goods, or under other applicable law as to both the real property and the goods in accordance with that party's rights and remedies in respect of the real property, in which case this article does not apply.

 

#### Section 47-2A502. Notice after default

Except as otherwise provided in this chapter or the lease agreement, the lessor or lessee in default under the lease contract is not entitled to notice of default or notice of enforcement from the other party to the lease agreement.

#### Section 47-2A503. Modification or impairment of rights and remedies

A. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the lease agreement may include rights and remedies for default in addition to or in substitution for those provided in this chapter and may limit or alter the measure of damages recoverable under this chapter.

B. Resort to a remedy provided under this chapter or in the lease agreement is optional unless the remedy is expressly agreed to be exclusive. If circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail of its essential purpose, or provision for an exclusive remedy is unconscionable, remedy may be had as provided in this chapter.

C. Consequential damages may be liquidated under section 47-2A504, or may otherwise be limited, altered or excluded unless the limitation, alteration or exclusion is unconscionable. Limitation, alteration or exclusion of consequential damages for injury to the person in the case of consumer goods is prima facie unconscionable but limitation, alteration or exclusion of damages where the loss is commercial is not prima facie unconscionable.

D. Rights and remedies on default by the lessor or the lessee with respect to any obligation or promise collateral or ancillary to the lease contract are not impaired by this chapter.

#### Section 47-2A504. Liquidation of damages

A. Damages payable by either party for default, or any other act or omission, including indemnity for loss or diminution of anticipated tax benefits or loss or damage to lessor's residual interest, may be liquidated in the lease agreement but only at an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the then anticipated harm caused by the default or other act or omission.

B. If the lease agreement provides for liquidation of damages, and such provision does not comply with subsection A of this section, or such provision is an exclusive or limited remedy that circumstances cause to fail of its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Article.

C. If the lessor justifiably withholds or stops delivery of goods because of the lessee's default or insolvency (section 47-2A525 or 47-2A526), the lessee is entitled to restitution of any amount by which the sum of his payments exceeds:

1. The amount to which the lessor is entitled by virtue of terms liquidating the lessor's damages in accordance with subsection A of this section; or

2. In the absence of those terms, twenty per cent of the then present value of the total rent the lessee was obligated to pay for the balance of the lease term, or, in the case of a consumer lease, the lesser of such amount or five hundred dollars.

D. A lessee's right to restitution under subsection C of this section is subject to offset to the extent the lessor establishes:

1. A right to recover damages under the provisions of this chapter other than subsection A of this section; and

2. The amount or value of any benefits received by the lessee directly or indirectly by reason of the lease contract.

#### Section 47-2A505. Cancellation and termination and effect of cancellation, termination, rescission or fraud on rights and remedies

A. On cancellation of the lease contract, all obligations that are still executory on both sides are discharged, but any right based on prior default or performance survives, and the cancelling party also retains any remedy for default of the whole lease contract or any unperformed balance.

B. On termination of the lease contract, all obligations that are still executory on both sides are discharged but any right based on prior default or performance survives.

C. Unless the contrary intention clearly appears, expressions of "cancellation", "rescission" or the like of the lease contract may not be construed as a renunciation or discharge of any claim in damages for an antecedent default.

D. Rights and remedies for material misrepresentation or fraud include, without limitation, all rights and remedies available under this Article for default.

E. Neither rescission nor a claim for rescission of the lease contract nor rejection or return of the goods may bar or be deemed inconsistent with a claim for damages or other right or remedy.

#### Section 47-2A506. Statute of limitations

A. An action for default under a lease contract, including breach of warranty or indemnity, must be commenced within four years after the cause of action accrued. By the original lease contract the parties may reduce the period of limitation to not less than one year.

B. A cause of action for default accrues when the act or omission on which the default or breach of warranty is based is or should have been discovered by the aggrieved party, or when the default occurs, whichever is later. A cause of action for indemnity accrues when the act or omission on which the claim for indemnity is based is or should have been discovered by the indemnified party, whichever is later.

C. If an action commenced within the time limited by subsection A is so terminated as to leave available a remedy by another action for the same default or breach of warranty or indemnity, the other action may be commenced after the expiration of the time limited and within six months after the termination of the first action unless the termination resulted from voluntary discontinuance or from dismissal for failure or neglect to prosecute.

D. This section does not alter the law on tolling of the statute of limitations nor does it apply to causes of action that have accrued before this chapter becomes effective.

#### Section 47-2A507. Proof of market rent; time and place

A. Damages based on market rent (section 47-2A519 or 47-2A528) are determined according to the rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and prevailing at the times specified in sections 47-2A519 and 47-2A528.

B. If evidence of rent for the use of the goods concerned for a lease term identical to the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and prevailing at the times or places described in this chapter is not readily available, the rent prevailing within any reasonable time before or after the time described or at any other place or for a different lease term which in commercial judgment or under usage of trade would serve as a reasonable substitute for the one described may be used, making any proper allowance for the difference, including the cost of transporting the goods to or from the other place.

C. Evidence of a relevant rent prevailing at a time or place or for a lease term other than the one described in this chapter offered by one party is not admissible unless and until he has given the other party notice the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise.

D. If the prevailing rent or value of any goods regularly leased in any established market is in issue, reports in official publications or trade journals or in newspapers or periodicals of general circulation published as the reports of that market are admissible in evidence. The circumstances of the preparation of the report may be shown to affect its weight but not its admissibility.

#### Section 47-2A508. Lessee's remedies

A. If a lessor fails to deliver the goods in conformity to the lease contract (section 47-2A509) or repudiates the lease contract (section 47-2A402), or a lessee rightfully rejects the goods (section 47-2A509) or justifiably revokes acceptance of the goods (section 47-2A517), then with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract is substantially impaired (section 47-2A510), the lessor is in default under the lease contract and the lessee may:

1. Cancel the lease contract (section 47-2A505, subsection A);

2. Recover so much of the rent and security as has been paid and is just under the circumstances;

3. Cover and recover damages as to all goods affected whether or not they have been identified to the lease contract (sections 47-2A518 and 47-2A520), or recover damages for nondelivery (sections 47-2A519 and 47-2A520);

4. Exercise any other rights or pursue any other remedies provided in the lease contract.

B. If a lessor fails to deliver the goods in conformity to the lease contract or repudiates the lease contract, the lessee may also:

1. If the goods have been identified, recover them (section 47-2A522); or

2. In a proper case, obtain specific performance or replevy the goods (section 47-2A521).

C. If a lessor is otherwise in default under a lease contract, the lessee may exercise the rights and pursue the remedies provided in the lease contract, which may include a right to cancel the lease, and in section 47-2A519, subsection C.

D. If a lessor has breached a warranty, whether express or implied, the lessee may recover damages (section 47-2A519, subsection D).

E. On rightful rejection or justifiable revocation of acceptance, a lessee has a security interest in goods in the lessee's possession or control for any rent and security that has been paid and any expenses reasonably incurred in their inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody and may hold those goods and dispose of them in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, subject to section 47-2A527, subsection E.

F. Subject to the provisions of section 47-2A407, a lessee, on notifying the lessor of the lessee's intention to do so, may deduct all or any part of the damages resulting from any default under the lease contract from any part of the rent still due under the same lease contract.

#### Section 47-2A509. Lessee's rights on improper delivery; rightful rejection

A. Subject to the provisions of section 47-2A510 on default in installment lease contracts, if the goods or the tender or delivery fail in any respect to conform to the lease contract, the lessee may reject or accept the goods or accept any commercial unit or units and reject the rest of the goods.

B. Rejection of goods is ineffective unless it is within a reasonable time after tender or delivery of the goods and the lessee seasonably notifies the lessor.

#### Section 47-2A510. Installment lease contracts; rejection and default

A. Under an installment lease contract a lessee may reject any delivery that is nonconforming if the nonconformity substantially impairs the value of that delivery and cannot be cured or the nonconformity is a defect in the required documents, but if the nonconformity does not fall within subsection B and the lessor or the supplier gives adequate assurance of its cure, the lessee must accept that delivery.

B. Whenever nonconformity or default with respect to one or more deliveries substantially impairs the value of the installment lease contract as a whole there is a default with respect to the whole. But, the aggrieved party reinstates the installment lease contract as a whole if the aggrieved party accepts a nonconforming delivery without seasonably notifying of cancellation or brings an action with respect only to past deliveries or demands performance as to future deliveries.

#### Section 47-2A511. Merchant lessee's duties as to rightfully rejected goods

A. Subject to any security interest of a lessee (section 47-2A508, subsection E), if a lessor or a supplier has no agent or place of business at the market of rejection, a merchant lessee, after rejection of goods in his possession or control, shall follow any reasonable instructions received from the lessor or the supplier with respect to the goods. In the absence of those instructions, a merchant lessee shall make reasonable efforts to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the goods for the lessor's account if they threaten to decline in value speedily. Instructions are not reasonable if on demand indemnity for expenses is not forthcoming.

B. If a merchant lessee (subsection A of this section) or any other lessee (section 47-2A512) disposes of goods, he is entitled to reimbursement either from the lessor or the supplier or out of the proceeds for reasonable expenses of caring for and disposing of the goods and, if the expenses include no disposition commission, to such commission as is usual in the trade, or if there is none, to a reasonable sum not exceeding ten per cent of the gross proceeds.

C. In complying with this section or section 47-2A512, the lessee is held only to good faith. Good faith conduct hereunder is neither acceptance or conversion nor the basis of an action for damages.

D. A purchaser who purchases in good faith from a lessee pursuant to this section or section 47-2A512 takes the goods free of any rights of the lessor and the supplier even though the lessee fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this chapter.

#### Section 47-2A512. Lessee's duties as to rightfully rejected goods

A. Except as otherwise provided with respect to goods that threaten to decline in value speedily (section 47-2A511) and subject to any security interest of a lessee (section 47-2A508, subsection E):

1. The lessee, after rejection of goods in the lessee's possession, shall hold them with reasonable care at the lessor's or the supplier's disposition for a reasonable time after the lessee's seasonable notification of rejection;

2. If the lessor or the supplier gives no instructions within a reasonable time after notification of rejection, the lessee may store the rejected goods for the lessor's or the supplier's account or ship them to the lessor or the supplier or dispose of them for the lessor's or the supplier's account with reimbursement in the manner provided in section 47-2A511; but

3. The lessee has no further obligations with regard to goods rightfully rejected.

B. Action by the lessee pursuant to subsection A of this section is not acceptance or conversion.

#### Section 47-2A513. Cure by lessor of improper tender or delivery; replacement

A. If any tender or delivery by the lessor or the supplier is rejected because nonconforming and the time for performance has not yet expired, the lessor or the supplier may seasonably notify the lessee of the lessor's or the supplier's intention to cure and may then make a conforming delivery within the time provided in the lease contract.

B. If the lessee rejects a nonconforming tender that the lessor or the supplier had reasonable grounds to believe would be acceptable with or without money allowance, the lessor or the supplier may have a further reasonable time to substitute a conforming tender if he seasonably notifies the lessee.

#### Section 47-2A514. Waiver of lessee's objections

A. In rejecting goods, a lessee's failure to state a particular defect that is ascertainable by reasonable inspection precludes the lessee from relying on the defect to justify rejection or to establish default:

1. If, stated seasonably, the lessor or the supplier could have cured it (section 47-2A513); or

2. Between merchants if the lessor or the supplier after rejection has made a request in writing for a full and final written statement of all defects on which the lessee proposes to rely.

B. A lessee's failure to reserve rights when paying rent or other consideration against documents precludes recovery of the payment for defects apparent in the documents.

 

#### Section 47-2A515. Acceptance of goods

A. Acceptance of goods occurs after the lessee has had a reasonable opportunity to inspect the goods and:

1. The lessee signifies or acts with respect to the goods in a manner that signifies to the lessor or the supplier that the goods are conforming or that the lessee will take or retain them in spite of their nonconformity; or

2. The lessee fails to make an effective rejection of the goods (section 47-2A509, subsection B).

B. Acceptance of a part of any commercial unit is acceptance of that entire unit.

#### Section 47-2A516. Effect of acceptance of goods; notice of default; burden of establishing default after acceptance; notice of claim or litigation to person answerable over

A. A lessee must pay rent for any goods accepted in accordance with the lease contract, with due allowance for goods rightfully rejected or not delivered.

B. A lessee's acceptance of goods precludes rejection of the goods accepted. In the case of a finance lease, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it. In any other case, if made with knowledge of a nonconformity, acceptance cannot be revoked because of it unless the acceptance was on the reasonable assumption that the nonconformity would be seasonably cured. Acceptance does not of itself impair any other remedy provided by this article or the lease agreement for nonconformity.

C. If a tender has been accepted:

1. Within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered any default, the lessee shall notify the lessor and the supplier, if any, or be barred from any remedy against the party not notified;

2. Except in the case of a consumer lease, within a reasonable time after the lessee receives notice of litigation for infringement or the like (section 47-2A211) the lessee shall notify the lessor or be barred from any remedy over for liability established by the litigation; and

3. The burden is on the lessee to establish any default.

D. If a lessee is sued for breach of a warranty or other obligation for which a lessor or a supplier is answerable over the following apply:

1. The lessee may give the lessor or the supplier, or both, written notice of the litigation. If the notice states that the person notified may come in and defend and that if the person notified does not do so that person will be bound in any action against that person by the lessee by any determination of fact common to the two litigations, then unless the person notified after seasonable receipt of the notice does come in and defend that person is so bound.

2. The lessor or the supplier may demand in writing that the lessee turn over control of the litigation including settlement if the claim is one for infringement or the like (section 47-2A211) or else be barred from any remedy over. If the demand states that the lessor or the supplier agrees to bear all expense and to satisfy any adverse judgment, then unless the lessee after seasonable receipt of the demand does turn over control the lessee is so barred.

E. Subsections C and D of this section apply to any obligation of a lessee to hold the lessor or the supplier harmless against infringement or the like (section 47-2A211).

#### Section 47-2A517. Revocation of acceptance of goods

A. A lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit whose nonconformity substantially impairs its value to the lessee if the lessee has accepted it:

1. Except in the case of a finance lease, on the reasonable assumption that its nonconformity would be cured and it has not been seasonably cured; or

2. Without discovery of the nonconformity if the lessee's acceptance was reasonably induced either by the lessor's assurances or, except in the case of a finance lease, by the difficulty of discovery before acceptance. In the case of a lease, other than a consumer lease, as to which any modification or waiver must be in writing, any assurance by the lessor which the lessee claims to have induced the lessee's acceptance must also be in writing.

B. Except in the case of a finance lease that is not a consumer lease, a lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit if the lessor defaults under the lease contract and the default substantially impairs the value of that lot or commercial unit to the lessee.

C. If the lease agreement so provides, the lessee may revoke acceptance of a lot or commercial unit because of other defaults by the lessor.

D. Revocation of acceptance must occur within a reasonable time after the lessee discovers or should have discovered the ground for it and before any substantial change in condition of the goods which is not caused by the nonconformity. Revocation is not effective until the lessee notifies the lessor.

E. A lessee who so revokes has the same rights and duties with regard to the goods involved as if the lessee had rejected them.

F. The lessee and lessor may, by a conspicuous writing contained in the lease or elsewhere, provide that the provisions of this section will not apply to a new motor vehicle which is otherwise subject to the provisions of title 44, chapter 9, article 5. Any such agreement may be made before or after the discovery of the nonconformity and may take the form of an option extended to either lessor or lessee. When the parties have so agreed, then for the purposes of title 44, chapter 9, article 5, the lessee shall be deemed the consumer of the motor vehicle, with the lessor having all the rights of a lienholder in such motor vehicle.

#### Section 47-2A518. Cover; substitute goods

A. After a default by a lessor under the lease contract of the type described in section 47-2A508, subsection A, or, if agreed, after other default by the lessor, the lessee may cover by making any purchase or lease of or contract to purchase or lease goods in substitution for those due from the lessor.

B. Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (section 47-2A504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (sections 47-1302 and 47-2A503), if a lessee's cover is by a lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the new lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessee may recover from the lessor as damages the present value, as of the date of the commencement of the term of the new lease agreement, of the rent under the new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term which is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement, and any incidental or consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.

C. If a lessee's cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection B of this section, or is by purchase or otherwise, the lessee may recover from the lessor as if the lessee had elected not to cover and section 47-2A519 governs.

 

#### Section 47-2A519. Lessee's damages for nondelivery, repudiation, default and breach of warranty in regard to accepted goods

A. Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (section 47-2A504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (sections 47-1302 and 47-2A503), if a lessee elects not to cover or a lessee elects to cover and the cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under section 47-2A518, subsection B, or is by purchase or otherwise, the measure of damages for nondelivery or repudiation by the lessor or for rejection or revocation of acceptance by the lessee is the present value, as of the date of the default, of the then market rent minus the present value as of the same date of the original rent, computed for the remaining lease term of the original lease agreement, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.

B. Market rent is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival.

C. Except as otherwise agreed, if the lessee has accepted goods and given notification (section 47-2A516, subsection C), the measure of damages for nonconforming tender or delivery or other default by a lessor is the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessor's default as determined in any manner that is reasonable together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default.

D. Except as otherwise agreed, the measure of damages for breach of warranty is the present value at the time and place of acceptance of the difference between the value of the use of the goods accepted and the value if they had been as warranted for the lease term, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default or breach of warranty.

 

#### Section 47-2A520. Lessee's incidental and consequential damages

A. Incidental damages resulting from a lessor's default include expenses reasonably incurred in inspection, receipt, transportation, and care and custody of goods rightfully rejected or goods the acceptance of which is justifiably revoked, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions in connection with effecting cover, and any other reasonable expense incident to the default.

B. Consequential damages resulting from a lessor's default include:

1. Any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the lessor at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably be prevented by cover or otherwise; and

2. Injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty.

#### Section 47-2A521. Lessee's right to specific performance or replevin

A. Specific performance may be decreed if the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances.

B. A decree for specific performance may include any terms and conditions as to payment of the rent, damages or other relief that the court deems just.

C. A lessee has a right of replevin, detinue, sequestration, claim and delivery, or the like for goods identified to the lease contract if after reasonable effort the lessee is unable to effect cover for those goods or the circumstances reasonably indicate that the effort will be unavailing.

#### Section 47-2A522. Lessee's right to goods on lessor's insolvency

A. Subject to subsection B of this section and even though the goods have not been shipped, a lessee who has paid a part or all of the rent and security for goods identified to a lease contract (section 47-2A217) on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of the rent and security due under the lease contract may recover the goods identified from the lessor if the lessor becomes insolvent within ten days after receipt of the first installment of rent and security.

B. A lessee acquires the right to recover goods identified to a lease contract only if they conform to the lease contract.

#### Section 47-2A523. Lessor's remedies

A. If a lessee wrongfully rejects or revokes acceptance of goods or fails to make a payment when due or repudiates with respect to a part or the whole, then, with respect to any goods involved, and with respect to all of the goods if under an installment lease contract the value of the whole lease contract is substantially impaired (section 47-2A510), the lessee is in default under the lease contract and the lessor may:

1. Cancel the lease contract (section 47-2A505, subsection A);

2. Proceed respecting goods not identified to the lease contract (section 47-2A524);

3. Withhold delivery of the goods and take possession of goods previously delivered (section 47-2A525);

4. Stop delivery of the goods by any bailee (section 47-2A526);

5. Dispose of the goods and recover damages (section 47-2A527), or retain the goods and recover damages (section 47-2A528), or in a proper case recover rent (section 47-2A529);

6. Exercise any other rights or pursue any other remedies provided in the lease contract.

B. If a lessor does not fully exercise a right or obtain a remedy to which the lessor is entitled under subsection A of this section, the lessor may recover the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessee's default as determined in any reasonable manner, together with incidental damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.

C. If a lessee is otherwise in default under a lease contract, the lessor may exercise the rights and pursue the remedies provided in the lease contract, which may include a right to cancel the lease. In addition, unless otherwise provided in the lease contract:

1. If the default substantially impairs the value of the lease contract to the lessor, the lessor may exercise the rights and pursue the remedies provided in subsection A or B of this section; or

2. If the default does not substantially impair the value of the lease contract to the lessor, the lessor may recover as provided in subsection B of this section.

#### Section 47-2A524. Lessor's right to identify goods to lease contract

A. After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in section 47-2A523, subsection A or section 47-2A523, subsection C, paragraph 1 or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, the lessor may:

1. Identify to the lease contract conforming goods not already identified if at the time the lessor learned of the default they were in the lessor's or the supplier's possession or control; and

2. Dispose of goods (section 47-2A527, subsection A) that demonstrably have been intended for the particular lease contract even though those goods are unfinished.

B. If the goods are unfinished, in the exercise of reasonable commercial judgment for the purposes of avoiding loss and of effective realization, an aggrieved lessor or the supplier may either complete manufacture and wholly identify the goods to the lease contract or cease manufacture and lease, sell or otherwise dispose of the goods for scrap or salvage value or proceed in any other reasonable manner.

#### Section 47-2A525. Lessor's right to possession of goods

A. If a lessor discovers the lessee to be insolvent, the lessor may refuse to deliver the goods.

B. After a default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in section 47-2A523, subsection A or section 47-2A523, subsection C, paragraph 1 or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, the lessor has the right to take possession of the goods. If the lease contract so provides, the lessor may require the lessee to assemble the goods and make them available to the lessor at a place to be designated by the lessor which is reasonably convenient to both parties. Without removal, the lessor may render unusable any goods employed in trade or business, and may dispose of goods on the lessee's premises (section 47-2A527).

C. The lessor may proceed under subsection B of this section without judicial process if it can be done without breach of the peace or the lessor may proceed by action.

#### Section 47-2A526. Lessor's stoppage of delivery in transit or otherwise

A. A lessor may stop delivery of goods in the possession of a carrier or other bailee if the lessor discovers the lessee to be insolvent and may stop delivery of carload, truckload, planeload or larger shipments of express or freight if the lessee repudiates or fails to make a payment due before delivery, whether for rent, security or otherwise under the lease contract, or for any other reason the lessor has a right to withhold or take possession of the goods.

B. In pursuing its remedies under subsection A, the lessor may stop delivery until:

1. Receipt of the goods by the lessee;

2. Acknowledgment to the lessee by any bailee of the goods, except a carrier, that the bailee holds the goods for the lessee; or

3. Such an acknowledgment to the lessee by a carrier via reshipment or as a warehouse.

C. To stop delivery, a lessor shall so notify as to enable the bailee by reasonable diligence to prevent delivery of the goods.

D. After notification, the bailee shall hold and deliver the goods according to the directions of the lessor, but the lessor is liable to the bailee for any ensuing charges or damages.

E. A carrier who has issued a nonnegotiable bill of lading is not obliged to obey a notification to stop received from a person other than the consignor.

 

#### Section 47-2A527. Lessor's rights to dispose of goods

A. After a default by a lessee under the lease contract of the type described in section 47-2A523, subsection A or subsection C, paragraph 1 or after the lessor refuses to deliver or takes possession of goods (section 47-2A525 or 47-2A526), or, if agreed, after other default by a lessee, the lessor may dispose of the goods concerned or the undelivered balance thereof by lease, sale or otherwise.

B. Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (section 47-2A504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (sections 47-1302 and 47-2A503), if the disposition is by lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the new lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of the commencement of the term of the new lease agreement, the present value, as of the same date, of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value, as of the same date, of the rent under the new lease agreement applicable to that period of the new lease term which is comparable to the then remaining term of the original lease agreement, and any incidental damages allowed under section 47-2A530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.

C. If the lessor's disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection B of this section, or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as if the lessor had elected not to dispose of the goods and section 47-2A528 governs.

D. A subsequent buyer or lessee who buys or leases from the lessor in good faith for value as a result of a disposition under this section takes the goods free of the original lease contract and any rights of the original lessee even though the lessor fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this chapter.

E. The lessor is not accountable to the lessee for any profit made on any disposition. A lessee who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance shall account to the lessor for any excess over the amount of the lessee's security interest (section 47-2A508, subsection E).

 

#### Section 47-2A528. Lessor's damages for nonacceptance, failure to pay, repudiation or other default

A. Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (section 47-2A504) or otherwise determined pursuant to agreement of the parties (sections 47-1302 and 47-2A503), if a lessor elects to retain the goods or a lessor elects to dispose of the goods and the disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under section 47-2A527, subsection B, or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages for a default of the type described in section 47-2A523, subsection A or subsection C, paragraph 1, or, if agreed, for other default of the lessee:

1. Accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of default if the lessee has never taken possession of the goods, or, if the lessee has taken possession of the goods, as of the date the lessor repossesses the goods or an earlier date on which the lessee makes a tender of the goods to the lessor;

2. The present value as of the date determined under paragraph 1 of the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement minus the present value as of the same date of the market rent at the place where the goods are located computed for the same lease term; and

3. Any incidental damages allowed under section 47-2A530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.

B. If the measure of damages provided in subsection A of this section is inadequate to put a lessor in as good a position as performance would have, the measure of damages is the present value of the profit, including reasonable overhead, the lessor would have made from full performance by the lessee, together with any incidental damages allowed under section 47-2A530, due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of disposition.

 

#### Section 47-2A529. Lessor's action for the rent

A. After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in section 47-2A523, subsection A or subsection C, paragraph 1 or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, if the lessor complies with subsection B of this section, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages:

1. For goods accepted by the lessee and not repossessed by or tendered to the lessor, and for conforming goods lost or damaged within a commercially reasonable time after risk of loss passes to the lessee (section 47-2A219), accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and any incidental damages allowed under section 47-2A530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default; and

2. For goods identified to the lease contract if the lessor is unable after reasonable effort to dispose of them at a reasonable price or the circumstances reasonably indicate that effort will be unavailing, accrued and unpaid rent as of the date of entry of judgment in favor of the lessor, the present value as of the same date of the rent for the then remaining lease term of the lease agreement, and any incidental damages allowed under section 47-2A530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default.

B. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, the lessor shall hold for the lessee for the remaining lease term of the lease agreement any goods that have been identified to the lease contract and are in the lessor's control.

C. The lessor may dispose of the goods at any time before collection of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection A of this section. If the disposition is before the end of the remaining lease term of the lease agreement, the lessor's recovery against the lessee for damages is governed by section 47-2A527 or 47-2A528, and the lessor will cause an appropriate credit to be provided against a judgment for damages to the extent that the amount of the judgment exceeds the recovery available pursuant to section 47-2A527 or 47-2A528.

D. Payment of the judgment for damages obtained pursuant to subsection A of this section entitles the lessee to the use and possession of the goods not then disposed of for the remaining lease term of and in accordance with the lease agreement.

E. After default by the lessee under the lease contract of the type described in section 47-2A523, subsection A or subsection C, paragraph 1 or, if agreed, after other default by the lessee, a lessor who is held not entitled to rent under this section must nevertheless be awarded damages for nonacceptance under section 47-2A527 or 47-2A528.

#### Section 47-2A530. Lessor's incidental damages

Incidental damages to an aggrieved lessor include any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions incurred in stopping delivery, in the transportation, care and custody of goods after the lessee's default, in connection with return or disposition of the goods or otherwise resulting from the default.

#### Section 47-2A531. Standing to sue third parties for injury to goods

A. If a third party so deals with goods that have been identified to a lease contract as to cause actionable injury to a party to the lease contract the lessor has a right of action against the third party, and the lessee also has a right of action against the third party if the lessee:

1. Has a security interest in the goods;

2. Has an insurable interest in the goods; or

3. Bears the risk of loss under the lease contract or has since the injury assumed that risk as against the lessor and the goods have been converted or destroyed.

B. If at the time of the injury the party plaintiff did not bear the risk of loss as against the other party to the lease contract and there is no arrangement between them for disposition of the recovery, his suit or settlement, subject to his own interest, is as a fiduciary for the other party to the lease contract.

C. Either party with the consent of the other may sue for the benefit of whom it may concern.

#### Section 47-2A532. Lessor's rights to residual interest

In addition to any other recovery permitted by this chapter or other law, the lessor may recover from the lessee an amount that will fully compensate the lessor for any loss of or damage to the lessor's residual interest in the goods caused by the default of the lessee.

#### Section 47-3104. Negotiable instrument

A. Except as provided in subsections C and D, "negotiable instrument" means an unconditional promise or order to pay a fixed amount of money, with or without interest or other charges described in the promise or order, if it:

1. Is payable to bearer or to order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder;

2. Is payable on demand or at a definite time; and

3. Does not state any other undertaking or instruction by the person promising or ordering payment to do any act in addition to the payment of money, but the promise or order may contain:

(a) An undertaking or power to give, maintain or protect collateral to secure payment;

(b) An authorization or power to the holder to confess judgment or realize on or dispose of collateral; or

(c) A waiver of the benefit of any law intended for the advantage or protection of an obligor.

B. "Instrument" means a negotiable instrument.

C. An order that meets all of the requirements of subsection A, except paragraph 1, and otherwise falls within the definition of "check" in subsection F is a negotiable instrument and a check.

D. A promise or order other than a check is not an instrument if, at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder, it contains a conspicuous statement, however expressed, to the effect that the promise or order is not negotiable or is not an instrument governed by this chapter.

E. An instrument is a "note" if it is a promise and is a "draft" if it is an order. If an instrument falls within the definition of both "note" and "draft", a person entitled to enforce the instrument may treat it as either.

F. "Check" means:

1. A draft, other than a documentary draft, payable on demand and drawn on a bank; or

2. A cashier's check or teller's check.

An instrument may be a check even though it is described on its face by another term, such as "money order".

G. "Cashier's check" means a draft with respect to which the drawer and drawee are the same bank or branches of the same bank.

H. "Teller's check" means a draft drawn by a bank:

1. On another bank; or

2. Payable at or through a bank.

I. "Traveler's check" means an instrument that:

1. Is payable on demand;

2. Is drawn on or payable at or through a bank;

3. Is designated by the term "traveler's check" or by a substantially similar term; and

4. Requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the instrument.

J. "Certificate of deposit" means an instrument containing an acknowledgment by a bank that a sum of money has been received by the bank and a promise by the bank to repay the sum of money. A certificate of deposit is a note of the bank.

#### Section 47-3105. Issue of instrument

A. "Issue" means the first delivery of an instrument by the maker or drawer, whether to a holder or nonholder, for the purpose of giving rights on the instrument to any person.

B. An unissued instrument, or an unissued incomplete instrument that is completed, is binding on the maker or drawer, but nonissuance is a defense. An instrument that is conditionally issued or is issued for a special purpose is binding on the maker or drawer, but failure of the condition or special purpose to be fulfilled is a defense.

C. "Issuer" applies to issued and unissued instruments and means a maker or drawer of an instrument.

#### Section 47-3106. Unconditional promise or order

A. Except as provided in this section, for the purposes of section 47-3104, subsection A, a promise or order is unconditional unless it states:

1. An express condition to payment;

2. That the promise or order is subject to or governed by another writing; or

3. That rights or obligations with respect to the promise or order are stated in another writing.

 

A reference to another writing does not of itself make the promise or order conditional.

B. A promise or order is not made conditional:

1. By a reference to another writing for a statement of rights with respect to collateral, prepayment or acceleration; or

2. Because payment is limited to resort to a particular fund or source.

C. If a promise or order requires, as a condition to payment, a countersignature by a person whose specimen signature appears on the promise or order, the condition does not make the promise or order conditional for the purposes of section 47-3104, subsection A. If the person whose specimen signature appears on an instrument fails to countersign the instrument, the failure to countersign is a defense to the obligation of the issuer, but the failure does not prevent a transferee of the instrument from becoming a holder of the instrument.

D. If a promise or order at the time it is issued or first comes into possession of a holder contains a statement, required by applicable statutory or administrative law, to the effect that the rights of a holder or transferee are subject to claims or defenses that the issuer could assert against the original payee, the promise or order is not thereby made conditional for the purposes of section 47-3104, subsection A, but if the promise or order is an instrument, there cannot be a holder in due course of the instrument.

#### Section 47-3107. Instrument payable in foreign money

Unless the instrument otherwise provides, an instrument that states the amount payable in foreign money may be paid in the foreign money or in an equivalent amount in dollars calculated by using the current bank-offered spot rate at the place of payment for the purchase of dollars on the day on which the instrument is paid.

#### Section 47-3108. Payable on demand or at definite time

A. A promise or order is "payable on demand" if it:

1. States that it is payable on demand or at sight, or otherwise indicates that it is payable at the will of the holder; or

2. Does not state any time of payment.

B. A promise or order is "payable at a definite time" if it is payable on elapse of a definite period of time after sight or acceptance or at a fixed date or dates or at a time or times readily ascertainable at the time the promise or order is issued, subject to rights of:

1. Prepayment;

2. Acceleration;

3. Extension at the option of the holder; or

4. Extension to a further definite time at the option of the maker or acceptor or automatically upon or after a specified act or event.

C. If an instrument, payable at a fixed date, is also payable upon demand made before the fixed date, the instrument is payable on demand until the fixed date and, if demand for payment is not made before that date, becomes payable at a definite time on the fixed date.

#### Section 47-3109. Payable to bearer or to order

A. A promise or order is payable to bearer if it:

1. States that it is payable to bearer or to the order of bearer or otherwise indicates that the person in possession of the promise or order is entitled to payment;

2. Does not state a payee; or

3. States that it is payable to or to the order of cash or otherwise indicates that it is not payable to an identified person.

B. A promise or order that is not payable to bearer is payable to order if it is payable:

1. To the order of an identified person; or

2. To an identified person or order.

A promise or order that is payable to order is payable to the identified person.

C. An instrument payable to bearer may become payable to an identified person if it is specially indorsed pursuant to section 47-3205, subsection A. An instrument payable to an identified person may become payable to bearer if it is indorsed in blank pursuant to section 47-3205, subsection B.

#### Section 47-3110. Identification of person to whom instrument is payable

A. The person to whom an instrument is initially payable is determined by the intent of the person, whether or not authorized, signing as, or in the name or behalf of, the issuer of the instrument. The instrument is payable to the person intended by the signer even if that person is identified in the instrument by a name or other identification that is not that of the intended person. If more than one person signs in the name or behalf of the issuer of an instrument and all the signers do not intend the same person as payee, the instrument is payable to any person intended by one or more of the signers.

B. If the signature of the issuer of an instrument is made by automated means, such as a check-writing machine, the payee of the instrument is determined by the intent of the person who supplied the name or identification of the payee, whether or not authorized to do so.

C. A person to whom an instrument is payable may be identified in any way, including by name, identifying number, office or account number. For the purpose of determining the holder of an instrument, the following rules apply:

1. If an instrument is payable to an account and the account is identified only by number, the instrument is payable to the person to whom the account is payable. If an instrument is payable to an account identified by number and by the name of a person, the instrument is payable to the named person, whether or not that person is the owner of the account identified by number.

2. If an instrument is payable to:

(a) A trust, an estate or a person described as trustee or representative of a trust or estate, the instrument is payable to the trustee, the representative or a successor of either, whether or not the beneficiary or estate is also named;

(b) A person described as agent or similar representative of a named or identified person, the instrument is payable to the represented person, the representative or a successor of the representative;

(c) A fund or organization that is not a legal entity, the instrument is payable to a representative of the members of the fund or organization; or

(d) An office or to a person described as holding an office, the instrument is payable to the named person, the incumbent of the office or a successor to the incumbent.

D. If an instrument is payable to two or more persons alternatively, it is payable to any of them and may be negotiated, discharged or enforced by any or all of them in possession of the instrument. If an instrument is payable to two or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged or enforced only by all of them. If an instrument payable to two or more persons is ambiguous as to whether it is payable to the persons alternatively, the instrument is payable to the persons alternatively.

#### Section 47-3111. Place of payment

Except as otherwise provided for items in chapter 4 of this title, an instrument is payable at the place of payment stated in the instrument. If no place of payment is stated, an instrument is payable at the address of the drawee or maker stated in the instrument. If no address is stated, the place of payment is the place of business of the drawee or maker. If a drawee or maker has more than one place of business, the place of payment is any place of business of the drawee or maker chosen by the person entitled to enforce the instrument. If the drawee or maker has no place of business, the place of payment is the residence of the drawee or maker.

#### Section 47-3112. Interest

A. Unless otherwise provided in the instrument:

1. An instrument is not payable with interest; and

2. Interest on an interest-bearing instrument is payable from the date of the instrument.

B. Interest may be stated in an instrument as a fixed or variable amount of money or it may be expressed as a fixed or variable rate or rates. The amount or rate of interest may be stated or described in the instrument in any manner and may require reference to information not contained in the instrument. If an instrument provides for interest, but the amount of interest payable cannot be ascertained from the description, interest is payable at the judgment rate in effect at the place of payment of the instrument and at the time interest first accrues.

#### Section 47-3113. Date of instrument

A. An instrument may be antedated or postdated. The date stated determines the time of payment if the instrument is payable at a fixed period after date. Except as provided in section 47-4401, subsection C, an instrument payable on demand is not payable before the date of the instrument.

B. If an instrument is undated, its date is the date of its issue or, in the case of an unissued instrument, the date it first comes into possession of a holder.

#### Section 47-3114. Contradictory terms of instrument

If an instrument contains contradictory terms, typewritten terms prevail over printed terms, handwritten terms prevail over both, and words prevail over numbers.

#### Section 47-3115. Incomplete instrument

A. "Incomplete instrument" means a signed writing, whether or not issued by the signer, the contents of which show at the time of signing that it is incomplete but that the signer intended it to be completed by the addition of words or numbers.

B. Subject to subsection C of this section, if an incomplete instrument is an instrument under section 47-3104, it may be enforced according to its terms if it is not completed, or according to its terms as augmented by completion. If an incomplete instrument is not an instrument under section 47-3104, but, after completion, the requirements of section 47-3104 are met, the instrument may be enforced according to its terms as augmented by completion.

C. If words or numbers are added to an incomplete instrument without authority of the signer, there is an alteration of the incomplete instrument under section 47-3407.

D. The burden of establishing that words or numbers were added to an incomplete instrument without authority of the signer is on the person asserting the lack of authority.

#### Section 47-3116. Joint and several liability; contribution

A. Except as otherwise provided in the instrument, two or more persons who have the same liability on an instrument as makers, drawers, acceptors, indorsers who indorse as joint payees, or anomalous indorsers are jointly and severally liable in the capacity in which they sign.

B. Except as provided in section 47-3419, subsection E or by agreement of the affected parties, a party having joint and several liability who pays the instrument is entitled to receive from any party having the same joint and several liability contribution in accordance with applicable law.

C. Discharge of one party having joint and several liability by a person entitled to enforce the instrument does not affect the right under subsection B of this section of a party having the same joint and several liability to receive contribution from the party discharged.

#### Section 47-3117. Other agreements affecting instrument

Subject to applicable law regarding exclusion of proof of contemporaneous or previous agreements, the obligation of a party to an instrument to pay the instrument may be modified, supplemented or nullified by a separate agreement of the obligor and a person entitled to enforce the instrument, if the instrument is issued or the obligation is incurred in reliance on the agreement or as part of the same transaction giving rise to the agreement. To the extent an obligation is modified, supplemented or nullified by an agreement under this section, the agreement is a defense to the obligation.

#### Section 47-3118. Statute of limitations

A. Except as provided in subsection E, an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay a note payable at a definite time must be commenced within six years after the due date or dates stated in the note or, if a due date is accelerated, within six years after the accelerated due date.

B. Except as provided in subsection D or E, if demand for payment is made to the maker of a note payable on demand, an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the note must be commenced within six years after the demand. If no demand for payment is made to the maker, an action to enforce the note is barred if neither principal nor interest on the note has been paid for a continuous period of ten years.

C. Except as provided in subsection D, an action to enforce the obligation of a party to an unaccepted draft to pay the draft must be commenced within three years after dishonor of the draft or ten years after the date of the draft, whichever period expires first.

D. An action to enforce the obligation of the acceptor of a certified check or the issuer of a teller's check, cashier's check or traveler's check must be commenced within three years after demand for payment is made to the acceptor or issuer, as the case may be.

E. An action to enforce the obligation of a party to a certificate of deposit to pay the instrument must be commenced within six years after demand for payment is made to the maker, but if the instrument states a due date and the maker is not required to pay before that date, the six year period begins when a demand for payment is in effect and the due date has passed.

F. An action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an accepted draft, other than a certified check, must be commenced:

1. Within six years after the due date or dates stated in the draft or acceptance if the obligation of the acceptor is payable at a definite time; or

2. Within six years after the date of the acceptance if the obligation of the acceptor is payable on demand.

G. Unless governed by other law regarding claims for indemnity or contribution, the following actions must be commenced within three years after the cause of action accrues:

1. An action for conversion of an instrument, for money had and received, or like action based on conversion;

2. An action for breach of warranty; or

3. An action to enforce an obligation, duty or right arising under this chapter and not governed by this section.

#### Section 47-3119. Notice of right to defend action

In an action for breach of an obligation for which a third person is answerable over pursuant to this chapter or chapter 4 of this title, the defendant may give the third person written notice of the litigation, and the person notified may then give similar notice to any other person who is answerable over. If the notice states that the person notified may come in and defend and that failure to do so will bind the person notified in an action later brought by the person giving the notice as to any determination of fact common to the two litigations, the person notified is so bound unless after seasonable receipt of the notice the person notified does come in and defend.

### Article 2 - Negotiation, Transfer and Indorsement

#### Section 47-3201. Negotiation

A. "Negotiation" means a transfer of possession, whether voluntary or involuntary, of an instrument by a person other than the issuer to a person who thereby becomes its holder.

B. Except for negotiation by a remitter, if an instrument is payable to an identified person, negotiation requires transfer of possession of the instrument and its indorsement by the holder. If an instrument is payable to bearer, it may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone.

#### Section 47-3202. Negotiation subject to rescission

A. Negotiation is effective even if obtained:

1. From an infant, a corporation exceeding its powers or a person without capacity;

2. By fraud, duress or mistake; or

3. In breach of duty or as part of an illegal transaction.

B. To the extent permitted by other law, negotiation may be rescinded or may be subject to other remedies, but those remedies may not be asserted against a subsequent holder in due course or a person paying the instrument in good faith and without knowledge of facts that are a basis for rescission or other remedy.

#### Section 47-3203. Transfer of instrument; rights acquired by transfer

A. An instrument is transferred when it is delivered by a person other than its issuer for the purpose of giving to the person receiving delivery the right to enforce the instrument.

B. Transfer of an instrument, whether or not the transfer is a negotiation, vests in the transferee any right of the transferor to enforce the instrument, including any right as a holder in due course, but the transferee cannot acquire rights of a holder in due course by a transfer, directly or indirectly, from a holder in due course if the transferee engaged in fraud or illegality affecting the instrument.

C. Unless otherwise agreed, if an instrument is transferred for value and the transferee does not become a holder because of lack of indorsement by the transferor, the transferee has a specifically enforceable right to the unqualified indorsement of the transferor, but negotiation of the instrument does not occur until the indorsement is made.

D. If a transferor purports to transfer less than the entire instrument, negotiation of the instrument does not occur. The transferee obtains no rights under this chapter and has only the rights of a partial assignee.

#### Section 47-3204. Indorsement

A. "Indorsement" means a signature, other than that of a signer as maker, drawer or acceptor, that alone or accompanied by other words is made on an instrument for the purpose of negotiating the instrument, restricting payment of the instrument or incurring the indorser's liability on the instrument, but regardless of the intent of the signer, a signature and its accompanying words is an indorsement unless the accompanying words, terms of the instrument, place of the signature or other circumstances unambiguously indicate that the signature was made for a purpose other than indorsement. For the purpose of determining whether a signature is made on an instrument, a paper affixed to the instrument is a part of the instrument.

B. "Indorser" means a person who makes an indorsement.

C. For the purpose of determining whether the transferee of an instrument is a holder, an indorsement that transfers a security interest in the instrument is effective as an unqualified indorsement of the instrument.

D. If an instrument is payable to a holder under a name that is not the name of the holder, indorsement may be made by the holder in the name stated in the instrument or in the holder's name, or both, but signature in both names may be required by a person paying or taking the instrument for value or collection.

#### Section 47-3205. Special indorsement; blank indorsement; anomalous indorsement

A. If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument, whether payable to an identified person or payable to bearer, and the indorsement identifies a person to whom it makes the instrument payable, it is a "special indorsement". When specially indorsed, an instrument becomes payable to the identified person and may be negotiated only by the indorsement of that person. The principles stated in section 47-3110 apply to special indorsements.

B. If an indorsement is made by the holder of an instrument and it is not a special indorsement, it is a "blank indorsement". When indorsed in blank, an instrument becomes payable to bearer and may be negotiated by transfer of possession alone until specially indorsed.

C. The holder may convert a blank indorsement that consists only of a signature into a special indorsement by writing, above the signature of the indorser, words identifying the person to whom the instrument is made payable.

D. "Anomalous indorsement" means an indorsement made by a person who is not the holder of the instrument. An anomalous indorsement does not affect the manner in which the instrument may be negotiated.

#### Section 47-3206. Restrictive indorsement

A. An indorsement limiting payment to a particular person or otherwise prohibiting further transfer or negotiation of the instrument is not effective to prevent further transfer or negotiation of the instrument.

B. An indorsement stating a condition to the right of the indorsee to receive payment does not affect the right of the indorsee to enforce the instrument. A person paying the instrument or taking it for value or collection may disregard the condition, and the rights and liabilities of that person are not affected by whether the condition has been fulfilled.

C. If an instrument bears an indorsement described in section 47-4201, subsection B or in blank or to a particular bank using the words "for deposit", "for collection" or other words indicating a purpose of having the instrument collected by a bank for the indorser or for a particular account, the following rules apply:

1. A person, other than a bank, who purchases the instrument when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid for the instrument is received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.

2. A depositary bank that purchases the instrument or takes it for collection when so indorsed converts the instrument unless the amount paid by the bank with respect to the instrument is received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.

3. A payor bank that is also the depositary bank or that takes the instrument for immediate payment over the counter from a person other than a collecting bank converts the instrument unless the proceeds of the instrument are received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.

4. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 3 of this subsection, a payor bank or intermediary bank may disregard the indorsement and is not liable if the proceeds of the instrument are not received by the indorser or applied consistently with the indorsement.

D. Except for an indorsement covered by subsection C of this section, if an instrument bears an indorsement using words to the effect that payment is to be made to the indorsee as agent, trustee or other fiduciary for the benefit of the indorser or another person, the following rules apply:

1. Unless there is notice of breach of fiduciary duty as provided in section 47-3307, a person who purchases the instrument from the indorsee or takes the instrument from the indorsee for collection or payment may pay the proceeds of payment or the value given for the instrument to the indorsee without regard to whether the indorsee violates a fiduciary duty to the indorser.

2. A subsequent transferee of the instrument or person who pays the instrument is neither given notice nor otherwise affected by the restriction in the indorsement unless the transferee or payor knows that the fiduciary dealt with the instrument or its proceeds in breach of fiduciary duty.

E. The presence on an instrument of an indorsement to which this section applies does not prevent a purchaser of the instrument from becoming a holder in due course of the instrument unless the purchaser is a converter under subsection C of this section or has notice or knowledge of breach of fiduciary duty as stated in subsection D of this section.

F. In an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the obligor has a defense if payment would violate an indorsement to which this section applies and the payment is not permitted by this section.

#### Section 47-3207. Reacquisition

Reacquisition of an instrument occurs if it is transferred to a former holder, by negotiation or otherwise. A former holder who reacquires the instrument may cancel indorsements made after the reacquirer first became a holder of the instrument. If the cancellation causes the instrument to be payable to the reacquirer or to bearer, the reacquirer may negotiate the instrument. An indorser whose indorsement is canceled is discharged, and the discharge is effective against any subsequent holder.

### Article 3 - Enforcement of Instruments

#### Section 47-3301. Person entitled to enforce instrument

"Person entitled to enforce" an instrument means the holder of the instrument, a nonholder in possession of the instrument who has the rights of a holder or a person not in possession of the instrument who is entitled to enforce the instrument pursuant to section 47-3309 or section 47-3418, subsection D. A person may be a person entitled to enforce the instrument even though the person is not the owner of the instrument or is in wrongful possession of the instrument.

#### Section 47-3302. Holder in due course

A. Subject to subsection C of this section and section 47-3106, subsection D, "holder in due course" means the holder of an instrument if:

1. The instrument when issued or negotiated to the holder does not bear such apparent evidence of forgery or alteration or is not otherwise so irregular or incomplete as to call into question its authenticity; and

2. The holder took the instrument:

(a) For value;

(b) In good faith;

(c) Without notice that the instrument is overdue or has been dishonored or that there is an uncured default with respect to payment of another instrument issued as part of the same series;

(d) Without notice that the instrument contains an unauthorized signature or has been altered;

(e) Without notice of any claim to the instrument described in section 47-3306; and

(f) Without notice that any party has a defense or claim in recoupment described in section 47-3305, subsection A.

B. Notice of discharge of a party, other than discharge in an insolvency proceeding, is not notice of a defense under subsection A of this section, but discharge is effective against a person who became a holder in due course with notice of the discharge. Public filing or recording of a document does not of itself constitute notice of a defense, claim in recoupment or claim to the instrument.

C. Except to the extent a transferor or predecessor in interest has rights as a holder in due course, a person does not acquire rights of a holder in due course of an instrument taken:

1. By legal process or by purchase in an execution, bankruptcy or creditor's sale or similar proceeding;

2. By purchase as part of a bulk transaction not in ordinary course of business of the transferor; or

3. As the successor in interest to an estate or other organization.

D. If, under section 47-3303, subsection A, paragraph 1, the promise of performance that is the consideration for an instrument has been partially performed, the holder may assert rights as a holder in due course of the instrument only to the fraction of the amount payable under the instrument equal to the value of the partial performance divided by the value of the promised performance.

E. If the person entitled to enforce an instrument has only a security interest in the instrument and the person obliged to pay the instrument has a defense, claim in recoupment or claim to the instrument that may be asserted against the person who granted the security interest, the person entitled to enforce the instrument may assert rights as a holder in due course only to an amount payable under the instrument which, at the time of enforcement of the instrument, does not exceed the amount of the unpaid obligation secured.

F. To be effective, notice must be received at a time and in a manner that gives a reasonable opportunity to act on it.

G. This section is subject to any law limiting status as a holder in due course in particular classes of transactions.

#### Section 47-3303. Value and consideration

A. An instrument is issued or transferred for value if:

1. The instrument is issued or transferred for a promise of performance, to the extent the promise has been performed;

2. The transferee acquires a security interest or other lien in the instrument other than a lien obtained by judicial proceeding;

3. The instrument is issued or transferred as payment of, or as security for, an antecedent claim against any person, whether or not the claim is due;

4. The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for a negotiable instrument; or

5. The instrument is issued or transferred in exchange for the incurring of an irrevocable obligation to a third party by the person taking the instrument.

B. "Consideration" means any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. The drawer or maker of an instrument has a defense if the instrument is issued without consideration. If an instrument is issued for a promise of performance, the issuer has a defense to the extent performance of the promise is due and the promise has not been performed. If an instrument is issued for value as stated in subsection A, the instrument is also issued for consideration.

#### Section 47-3304. Overdue instrument

A. An instrument payable on demand becomes overdue at the earliest of the following times:

1. On the day after the day demand for payment is duly made;

2. If the instrument is a check, ninety days after its date; or

3. If the instrument is not a check, when the instrument has been outstanding for a period of time after its date which is unreasonably long under the circumstances of the particular case in light of the nature of the instrument and usage of the trade.

B. With respect to an instrument payable at a definite time the following rules apply:

1. If the principal is payable in installments and a due date has not been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue upon default under the instrument for nonpayment of an installment, and the instrument remains overdue until the default is cured.

2. If the principal is not payable in installments and the due date has not been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue on the day after the due date.

3. If a due date with respect to principal has been accelerated, the instrument becomes overdue on the day after the accelerated due date.

C. Unless the due date of principal has been accelerated, an instrument does not become overdue if there is default in payment of interest but no default in payment of principal.

#### Section 47-3305. Defenses and claims in recoupment

A. Except as stated in subsection B of this section, the right to enforce the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is subject to the following:

1. A defense of the obligor based on:

(a) Infancy of the obligor to the extent it is a defense to a simple contract;

(b) Duress, lack of legal capacity or illegality of the transaction which, under other law, nullifies the obligation of the obligor;

(c) Fraud that induced the obligor to sign the instrument with neither knowledge nor reasonable opportunity to learn of its character or its essential terms; or

(d) Discharge of the obligor in insolvency proceedings.

2. A defense of the obligor stated in another section of this chapter or a defense of the obligor that would be available if the person entitled to enforce the instrument were enforcing a right to payment under a simple contract; and

3. A claim in recoupment of the obligor against the original payee of the instrument if the claim arose from the transaction that gave rise to the instrument, but the claim of the obligor may be asserted against a transferee of the instrument only to reduce the amount owing on the instrument at the time the action is brought.

B. The right of a holder in due course to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument is subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section but is not subject to defenses of the obligor stated in subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section or claims in recoupment stated in subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section against a person other than the holder.

C. Except as stated in subsection D of this section, in an action to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the obligor may not assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument a defense, claim in recoupment or claim to the instrument (section 47-3306) of another person, but the other person's claim to the instrument may be asserted by the obligor if the other person is joined in the action and personally asserts the claim against the person entitled to enforce the instrument. An obligor is not obliged to pay the instrument if the person seeking enforcement of the instrument does not have rights of a holder in due course and the obligor proves that the instrument is a lost or stolen instrument.

D. In an action to enforce the obligation of an accommodation party to pay an instrument, the accommodation party may assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument any defense or claim in recoupment under subsection A of this section that the accommodated party could assert against the person entitled to enforce the instrument, except the defenses of discharge in insolvency proceedings, infancy and lack of legal capacity.

#### Section 47-3306. Claims to an instrument

A person taking an instrument, other than a person having rights of a holder in due course, is subject to a claim of a property or possessory right in the instrument or its proceeds, including a claim to rescind a negotiation and to recover the instrument or its proceeds. A person having rights of a holder in due course takes free of the claim to the instrument.

#### Section 47-3307. Notice of breach of fiduciary duty

A. In this section:

1. "Fiduciary" means an agent, trustee, partner, corporate officer or director or other representative owing a fiduciary duty with respect to an instrument.

2. "Represented person" means the principal, beneficiary, partnership, corporation or other person to whom the duty stated in paragraph 1 of this subsection is owed.

B. If an instrument is taken from a fiduciary for payment or collection or for value, the taker has knowledge of the fiduciary status of the fiduciary and the represented person makes a claim to the instrument or its proceeds on the basis that the transaction of the fiduciary is a breach of fiduciary duty, the following rules apply:

1. Notice of breach of fiduciary duty by the fiduciary is notice of the claim of the represented person.

2. In the case of an instrument payable to the represented person or the fiduciary as such, the taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is:

(a) Taken in payment of or as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary;

(b) Taken in a transaction known by the taker to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary; or

(c) Deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented person.

3. If an instrument is issued by the represented person or the fiduciary as such, and made payable to the fiduciary personally, the taker does not have notice of the breach of fiduciary duty unless the taker knows of the breach of fiduciary duty.

4. If an instrument is issued by the represented person or the fiduciary as such, to the taker as payee, the taker has notice of the breach of fiduciary duty if the instrument is:

(a) Taken in payment of or as security for a debt known by the taker to be the personal debt of the fiduciary;

(b) Taken in a transaction known by the taker to be for the personal benefit of the fiduciary; or

(c) Deposited to an account other than an account of the fiduciary, as such, or an account of the represented person.

#### Section 47-3308. Proof of signatures and status as holder in due course

A. In an action with respect to an instrument, the authenticity of, and authority to make, each signature on the instrument is admitted unless specifically denied in the pleadings. If the validity of a signature is denied in the pleadings, the burden of establishing validity is on the person claiming validity, but the signature is presumed to be authentic and authorized unless the action is to enforce the liability of the purported signer and the signer is dead or incompetent at the time of trial of the issue of validity of the signature. If an action to enforce the instrument is brought against a person as the undisclosed principal of a person who signed the instrument as a party to the instrument, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the defendant is liable on the instrument as a represented person under section 47-3402, subsection A.

B. If the validity of signatures is admitted or proved and there is compliance with subsection A of this section, a plaintiff producing the instrument is entitled to payment if the plaintiff proves entitlement to enforce the instrument under section 47-3301, unless the defendant proves a defense or claim in recoupment. If a defense or claim in recoupment is proved, the right to payment of the plaintiff is subject to the defense or claim, except to the extent the plaintiff proves that the plaintiff has rights of a holder in due course which are not subject to the defense or claim.

#### Section 47-3309. Enforcement of lost, destroyed or stolen instrument

A. A person not in possession of an instrument is entitled to enforce the instrument if:

1. The person was in possession of the instrument and entitled to enforce it when loss of possession occurred;

2. The loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the person or a lawful seizure; and

3. The person cannot reasonably obtain possession of the instrument because the instrument was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.

B. A person seeking enforcement of an instrument under subsection A of this section must prove the terms of the instrument and the person's right to enforce the instrument. If that proof is made, section 47-3308 applies to the case as if the person seeking enforcement had produced the instrument. The court may not enter judgment in favor of the person seeking enforcement unless it finds that the person required to pay the instrument is adequately protected against loss that might occur by reason of a claim by another person to enforce the instrument. Adequate protection may be provided by any reasonable means.

#### Section 47-3310. Effect of instrument on obligation for which taken

A. Unless otherwise agreed, if a certified check, cashier's check or teller's check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken in payment of the obligation. Discharge of the obligation does not affect any liability that the obligor may have as an indorser of the instrument.

B. Unless otherwise agreed and except as provided in subsection A, if a note or an uncertified check is taken for an obligation, the obligation is suspended to the same extent the obligation would be discharged if an amount of money equal to the amount of the instrument were taken, and the following rules apply:

1. In the case of an uncertified check, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the check or until it is paid or certified. Payment or certification of the check results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the amount of the check.

2. In the case of a note, suspension of the obligation continues until dishonor of the note or until it is paid. Payment of the note results in discharge of the obligation to the extent of the payment.

3. Except as provided in paragraph 4, if the check or note is dishonored and the obligee of the obligation for which the instrument was taken is the person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligee may enforce either the instrument or the obligation. In the case of an instrument of a third person which is negotiated to the obligee by the obligor, discharge of the obligor on the instrument also discharges the obligation.

4. If the person entitled to enforce the instrument taken for an obligation is a person other than the obligee, the obligee may not enforce the obligation to the extent the obligation is suspended. If the obligee is the person entitled to enforce the instrument but no longer has possession of it because it was lost, stolen or destroyed, the obligation may not be enforced to the extent of the amount payable on the instrument, and to that extent the obligee's rights against the obligor are limited to enforcement of the instrument.

C. If an instrument other than one described in subsection A or B is taken for an obligation, the effect is:

1. That stated in subsection A if the instrument is one on which a bank is liable as maker or acceptor; or

2. That stated in subsection B in any other case.

#### Section 47-3311. Accord and satisfaction by use of instrument

A. If a person against whom a claim is asserted proves that the person in good faith tendered an instrument to the claimant as full satisfaction of the claim, the amount of the claim was unliquidated or subject to a bona fide dispute and the claimant obtained payment of the instrument, subsections B and C apply.

B. Unless subsection C applies, the claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that the instrument or an accompanying written communication contained a conspicuous statement to the effect that the instrument was tendered as full satisfaction of the claim.

C. Subject to subsection D, a claim is not discharged under subsection B if either of the following applies:

1. The claimant, if an organization, proves that:

(a) Within a reasonable time before the tender, the claimant sent a conspicuous statement to the person against whom the claim is asserted that communications concerning disputed debts, including an instrument tendered as full satisfaction of a debt, are to be sent to a designated person, office or place; and

(b) The instrument or accompanying communication was not received by that designated person, office or place.

2. The claimant, whether or not an organization, proves that within ninety days after payment of the instrument, the claimant tendered repayment of the amount of the instrument to the person against whom the claim is asserted. This paragraph does not apply if the claimant is an organization that sent a statement complying with paragraph 1, subdivision (a).

D. A claim is discharged if the person against whom the claim is asserted proves that within a reasonable time before collection of the instrument was initiated, the claimant, or an agent of the claimant having direct responsibility with respect to the disputed obligation, knew that the instrument was tendered in full satisfaction of the claim.

#### Section 47-3312. Lost, destroyed or stolen cashier's check, teller's check or certified check

A. In this section:

1. "Check" means a cashier's check, teller's check or certified check.

2. "Claimant" means a person who claims the right to receive the amount of a cashier's check, teller's check or certified check that was lost, destroyed or stolen.

3. "Declaration of loss" means a written statement, made under penalty of perjury, to the effect that all of the following:

(a) The declarer lost possession of a check.

(b) The declarer is the drawer or payee of the check, in the case of a certified check, or the remitter or payee of the check, in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check.

(c) The loss of possession was not the result of a transfer by the declarer or a lawful seizure.

(d) The declarer cannot reasonably obtain possession of the check because the check was destroyed, its whereabouts cannot be determined or it is in the wrongful possession of an unknown person or a person that cannot be found or is not amenable to service of process.

4. "Obligated bank" means the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's check or the acceptor of a certified check.

B. A claimant may assert a claim to the amount of a check by a communication to the obligated bank describing the check with reasonable certainty and requesting payment of the amount of the check, if all of the following:

1. The claimant is the drawer or payee of a certified check or the remitter or payee of a cashier's check or teller's check.

2. The communication contains or is accompanied by a declaration of loss of the claimant with respect to the check.

3. The communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable time to act on it before the check is paid.

4. The claimant provides reasonable identification if requested by the obligated bank.

C. Delivery of a declaration of loss is a warranty of the truth of the statements made in the declaration.  If a claim is asserted in compliance with subsection B of this section, the following rules apply:

1. The claim becomes enforceable at the later of either of the following:

(a) The time the claim is asserted.

(b) The ninetieth day following the date of the check, in the case of a cashier's check or teller's check, or the ninetieth day following the date of the acceptance, in the case of a certified check.

2. Until the claim becomes enforceable, it has no legal effect and the obligated bank may pay the check or, in the case of a teller's check, may permit the drawee to pay the check.  Payment to a person entitled to enforce the check discharges all liability of the obligated bank with respect to the check.

3. If the claim becomes enforceable before the check is presented for payment, the obligated bank is not obliged to pay the check.

4. When the claim becomes enforceable, the obligated bank becomes obliged to pay the amount of the check to the claimant if payment of the check has not been made to a person entitled to enforce the check.  Subject to section 47-4302, subsection A, paragraph 1, payment to the claimant discharges all liability of the obligated bank with respect to the check.

D. If the obligated bank pays the amount of a check to a claimant under subsection C, paragraph 4 of this section and the check is presented for payment by a person having rights of a holder in due course, the claimant is obliged to either:

1. Refund the payment to the obligated bank if the check is paid.

2. Pay the amount of the check to the person having rights of a holder in due course if the check is dishonored.

E. If a claimant has the right to assert a claim under subsection B of this section and is also a person entitled to enforce a cashier's check, teller's check or certified check which is lost, destroyed or stolen, the claimant may assert rights with respect to the check either under this section or section 47-3309.

 

### Article 4 - Liability of Parties

#### Section 47-3401. Signature

A. A person is not liable on an instrument unless:

1. The person signed the instrument; or

2. The person is represented by an agent or representative who signed the instrument and the signature is binding on the represented person under section 47-3402.

B. A signature may be made:

1. Manually or by means of a device or machine; and

2. By the use of any name, including a trade or assumed name, or by a word, mark or symbol executed or adopted by a person with present intention to authenticate a writing.

#### Section 47-3402. Signature by representative

A. If a person acting, or purporting to act, as a representative signs an instrument by signing either the name of the represented person or the name of the signer, the represented person is bound by the signature to the same extent the represented person would be bound if the signature were on a simple contract. If the represented person is bound, the signature of the representative is the "authorized signature of the represented person" and the represented person is liable on the instrument, whether or not identified in the instrument.

B. If a representative signs the name of the representative to an instrument and the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person, the following rules apply:

1. If the form of the signature shows unambiguously that the signature is made on behalf of the represented person who is identified in the instrument, the representative is not liable on the instrument.

2. Subject to subsection C, if the form of the signature does not show unambiguously that the signature is made in a representative capacity or the represented person is not identified in the instrument, the representative is liable on the instrument to a holder in due course that took the instrument without notice that the representative was not intended to be liable on the instrument. With respect to any other person, the representative is liable on the instrument unless the representative proves that the original parties did not intend the representative to be liable on the instrument.

C. If a representative signs the name of the representative as drawer of a check without indication of the representative status and the check is payable from an account of the represented person who is identified on the check, the signer is not liable on the check if the signature is an authorized signature of the represented person.

#### Section 47-3403. Unauthorized signature

A. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter or chapter 4 of this title, an unauthorized signature is ineffective except as the signature of the unauthorized signer in favor of a person who in good faith pays the instrument or takes it for value. An unauthorized signature may be ratified for all purposes of this chapter.

B. If the signature of more than one person is required to constitute the authorized signature of an organization, the signature of the organization is unauthorized if one of the required signatures is lacking.

C. The civil or criminal liability of a person who makes an unauthorized signature is not affected by any provision of this chapter which makes the unauthorized signature effective for the purposes of this chapter.

#### Section 47-3404. Impostors; fictitious payees

A. If an impostor, by use of the mails or otherwise, induces the issuer of an instrument to issue the instrument to the impostor, or to a person acting in concert with the impostor, by impersonating the payee of the instrument or a person authorized to act for the payee, an indorsement of the instrument by any person in the name of the payee is effective as the indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.

B. If a person whose intent determines to whom an instrument is payable (section 47-3110, subsection A or B) does not intend the person identified as payee to have any interest in the instrument or the person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person, the following rules apply until the instrument is negotiated by special indorsement:

1. Any person in possession of the instrument is its holder.

2. An indorsement by any person in the name of the payee stated in the instrument is effective as the indorsement of the payee in favor of a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.

C. Under subsection A or B of this section, an indorsement is made in the name of a payee if:

1. It is made in a name substantially similar to that of the payee; or

2. The instrument, whether or not indorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to that of the payee.

D. With respect to an instrument to which subsection A or B of this section applies, if a person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from payment of the instrument, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.

#### Section 47-3405. Employer's responsibility for fraudulent indorsement by employee

A. In this section:

1. "Employee" includes an independent contractor and employee of an independent contractor retained by the employer.

2. "Fraudulent indorsement" means:

(a) In the case of an instrument payable to the employer, a forged indorsement purporting to be that of the employer; or

(b) In the case of an instrument with respect to which the employer is the issuer, a forged indorsement purporting to be that of the person identified as payee.

3. "Responsibility" with respect to instruments means authority to:

(a) Sign or indorse instruments on behalf of the employer;

(b) Process instruments received by the employer for bookkeeping purposes, for deposit to an account or for other disposition;

(c) Prepare or process instruments for issue in the name of the employer;

(d) Supply information determining the names or addresses of payees of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer;

(e) Control the disposition of instruments to be issued in the name of the employer; or

(f) Act otherwise with respect to instruments in a responsible capacity.

 

Responsibility does not include authority that merely allows an employee to have access to instruments or blank or incomplete instrument forms that are being stored or transported or are part of incoming or outgoing mail, or similar access.

B. For the purpose of determining the rights and liabilities of a person who, in good faith, pays an instrument or takes it for value or for collection, if an employer entrusted an employee with responsibility with respect to the instrument and the employee or a person acting in concert with the employee makes a fraudulent indorsement of the instrument, the indorsement is effective as the indorsement of the person to whom the instrument is payable if it is made in the name of that person. If the person paying the instrument or taking it for value or for collection fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss resulting from the fraud, the person bearing the loss may recover from the person failing to exercise ordinary care to the extent the failure to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.

C. Under subsection B, an indorsement is made in the name of the person to whom an instrument is payable if:

1. It is made in a name substantially similar to the name of that person; or

2. The instrument, whether or not indorsed, is deposited in a depositary bank to an account in a name substantially similar to the name of that person.

#### Section 47-3406. Negligence contributing to forged signature or alteration of instrument

A. A person whose failure to exercise ordinary care substantially contributes to an alteration of an instrument or to the making of a forged signature on an instrument is precluded from asserting the alteration or the forgery against a person who, in good faith, pays the instrument or takes it for value or for collection.

B. Under subsection A, if the person asserting the preclusion fails to exercise ordinary care in paying or taking the instrument and that failure substantially contributes to loss, the loss is allocated between the person precluded and the person asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of each to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss.

C. Under subsection A, the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person asserting the preclusion. Under subsection B, the burden of proving failure to exercise ordinary care is on the person precluded.

#### Section 47-3407. Alteration

A. "Alteration" means:

1. An unauthorized change in an instrument that purports to modify in any respect the obligation of a party; or

2. An unauthorized addition of words or numbers or other change to an incomplete instrument relating to the obligation of a party.

B. Except as provided in subsection C, an alteration fraudulently made discharges a party whose obligation is affected by the alteration unless that party assents or is precluded from asserting the alteration. No other alteration discharges a party, and the instrument may be enforced according to its original terms.

C. A payor bank or drawee paying a fraudulently altered instrument or a person taking it for value, in good faith and without notice of the alteration, may enforce rights with respect to the instrument:

1. According to its original terms; or

2. In the case of an incomplete instrument altered by unauthorized completion, according to its terms as completed.

#### Section 47-3408. Drawee not liable on unaccepted draft

A check or other draft does not of itself operate as an assignment of funds in the hands of the drawee available for its payment, and the drawee is not liable on the instrument until the drawee accepts it.

#### Section 47-3409. Acceptance of draft; certified check

A. "Acceptance" means the drawee's signed agreement to pay a draft as presented. It must be written on the draft and may consist of the drawee's signature alone. Acceptance may be made at any time and becomes effective when notification pursuant to instructions is given or the accepted draft is delivered for the purpose of giving rights on the acceptance to any person.

B. A draft may be accepted although it has not been signed by the drawer, is otherwise incomplete, is overdue or has been dishonored.

C. If a draft is payable at a fixed period after sight and the acceptor fails to date the acceptance, the holder may complete the acceptance by supplying a date in good faith.

D. "Certified check" means a check accepted by the bank on which it is drawn. Acceptance may be made as stated in subsection A or by a writing on the check which indicates that the check is certified. The drawee of a check has no obligation to certify the check, and refusal to certify is not dishonor of the check.

#### Section 47-3410. Acceptance varying draft

A. If the terms of a drawee's acceptance vary from the terms of the draft as presented, the holder may refuse the acceptance and treat the draft as dishonored. In that case, the drawee may cancel the acceptance.

B. The terms of a draft are not varied by an acceptance to pay at a particular bank or place in the United States, unless the acceptance states that the draft is to be paid only at that bank or place.

C. If the holder assents to an acceptance varying the terms of a draft, the obligation of each drawer and indorser that does not expressly assent to the acceptance is discharged.

#### Section 47-3411. Refusal to pay cashier's checks, teller's checks and certified checks

A. In this section, "obligated bank" means the acceptor of a certified check or the issuer of a cashier's check or teller's check bought from the issuer.

B. If the obligated bank wrongfully refuses to pay a cashier's check or certified check, stops payment of a teller's check or refuses to pay a dishonored teller's check, the person asserting the right to enforce the check is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the nonpayment and may recover consequential damages if the obligated bank refuses to pay after receiving notice of particular circumstances giving rise to the damages.

C. Expenses or consequential damages under subsection B are not recoverable if the refusal of the obligated bank to pay occurs because:

1. The bank suspends payments;

2. The obligated bank asserts a claim or defense of the bank that it has reasonable grounds to believe is available against the person entitled to enforce the instrument;

3. The obligated bank has a reasonable doubt whether the person demanding payment is the person entitled to enforce the instrument; or

4. Payment is prohibited by law.

#### Section 47-3412. Obligation of issuer of note or cashier's check

The issuer of a note or cashier's check or other draft drawn on the drawer is obliged to pay the instrument:

1. According to its terms at the time it was issued or, if not issued, at the time it first came into possession of a holder; or

2. If the issuer signed an incomplete instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the extent stated in sections 47-3115 and 47-3407. The obligation is owed to a person entitled to enforce the instrument or to an indorser who paid the instrument under section 47-3415.

#### Section 47-3413. Obligation of acceptor

A. The acceptor of a draft is obliged to pay the draft:

1. According to its terms at the time it was accepted, even though the acceptance states that the draft is payable "as originally drawn" or equivalent terms;

2. If the acceptance varies the terms of the draft, according to the terms of the draft as varied; or

3. If the acceptance is of a draft that is an incomplete instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the extent stated in sections 47-3115 and 47-3407. The obligation is owed to a person entitled to enforce the draft or to the drawer or an indorser who paid the draft under section 47-3414 or 47-3415.

B. If the certification of a check or other acceptance of a draft states the amount certified or accepted, the obligation of the acceptor is that amount. If the certification or acceptance does not state an amount, if the amount of the instrument is subsequently raised and if the instrument is then negotiated to a holder in due course, the obligation of the acceptor is the amount of the instrument at the time it was taken by the holder in due course.

#### Section 47-3414. Obligation of drawer

A. This section does not apply to cashier's checks or other drafts drawn on the drawer.

B. If an unaccepted draft is dishonored, the drawer is obliged to pay the draft according to its terms at the time it was issued or, if not issued, at the time it first came into possession of a holder, or if the drawer signed an incomplete instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the extent stated in sections 47-3115 and 47-3407. The obligation is owed to a person entitled to enforce the draft or to an indorser who paid the draft under section 47-3415.

C. If a draft is accepted by a bank, the drawer is discharged, regardless of when or by whom acceptance was obtained.

D. If a draft is accepted and the acceptor is not a bank, the obligation of the drawer to pay the draft if the draft is dishonored by the acceptor is the same as the obligation of an indorser under section 47-3415, subsections A and C.

E. If a draft states that it is drawn "without recourse" or otherwise disclaims liability of the drawer to pay the draft, the drawer is not liable under subsection B of this section to pay the draft if the draft is not a check. A disclaimer of the liability stated in subsection B of this section is not effective if the draft is a check.

F. If a check is not presented for payment or given to a depositary bank for collection within thirty days after its date, if the drawee suspends payments after expiration of the thirty day period without paying the check and, because of the suspension of payments, if the drawer is deprived of funds maintained with the drawee to cover payment of the check, the drawer to the extent deprived of funds may discharge its obligation to pay the check by assigning to the person entitled to enforce the check the rights of the drawer against the drawee with respect to the funds.

#### Section 47-3415. Obligation of indorser

A. Subject to subsections B, C, D and E of this section and to section 47-3419, subsection D, if an instrument is dishonored, an indorser is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument according to the terms of the instrument at the time it was indorsed, or if the indorser indorsed an incomplete instrument, according to its terms when completed, to the extent stated in sections 47-3115 and 47-3407. The obligation of the indorser is owed to a person entitled to enforce the instrument or to a subsequent indorser who paid the instrument under this section.

B. If an indorsement states that it is made "without recourse" or otherwise disclaims liability of the indorser, the indorser is not liable under subsection A of this section to pay the instrument.

C. If notice of dishonor of an instrument is required by section 47-3503 and notice of dishonor complying with that section is not given to an indorser, the liability of the indorser under subsection A of this section is discharged.

D. If a draft is accepted by a bank after an indorsement is made, the liability of the indorser under subsection A of this section is discharged.

E. If an indorser of a check is liable under subsection A of this section and the check is not presented for payment, or given to a depositary bank for collection, within thirty days after the day the indorsement was made, the liability of the indorser under subsection A of this section is discharged.

#### Section 47-3416. Transfer warranties

A. A person who transfers an instrument for consideration warrants to the transferee and, if the transfer is by indorsement, to any subsequent transferee that:

1. The warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the instrument;

2. All signatures on the instrument are authentic and authorized;

3. The instrument has not been altered;

4. The instrument is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment of any party which can be asserted against the warrantor; and

5. The warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer.

B. A person to whom the warranties under subsection A are made and who took the instrument in good faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result of the breach, but not more than the amount of the instrument plus expenses and loss of interest incurred as a result of the breach.

C. The warranties stated in subsection A cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the liability of the warrantor under subsection B is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.

D. A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.

#### Section 47-3417. Presentment warranties

A. If an unaccepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee pays or accepts the draft, the person obtaining payment or acceptance, at the time of presentment, and a previous transferor of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant to the drawee making payment or accepting the draft in good faith that:

1. The warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the draft, a person entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the draft;

2. The draft has not been altered; and

3. The warrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the drawer of the draft is unauthorized.

B. A drawee making payment may recover from any warrantor damages for breach of warranty equal to the amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer because of the payment. In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment. If the drawee accepts the draft, breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor. If the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this subsection.

C. If a drawee asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection A of this section based on an unauthorized indorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the indorsement is effective under section 47-3404 or 47-3405 or the drawer is precluded under section 47-3406 or 47-4406 from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized indorsement or alteration.

D. If a dishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an indorser or any other instrument is presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the instrument, and payment is received, the following rules apply:

1. The person obtaining payment and a prior transferor of the instrument warrant to the person making payment in good faith that the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the instrument, a person entitled to enforce the instrument or authorized to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the instrument.

2. The person making payment may recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal to the amount paid plus expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.

E. The warranties stated in subsections A and D of this section cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the liability of the warrantor under subsection B or D of this section is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.

F. A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.

#### Section 47-3418. Payment or acceptance by mistake

A. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, if the drawee of a draft pays or accepts the draft and the drawee acted on the mistaken belief that payment of the draft had not been stopped pursuant to section 47-4403 or the signature of the drawer of the draft was authorized, the drawee may recover the amount of the draft from the person to whom or for whose benefit payment was made or, in the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance. Rights of the drawee under this subsection are not affected by failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in paying or accepting the draft.

B. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, if an instrument has been paid or accepted by mistake and the case is not covered by subsection A of this section, the person paying or accepting may, to the extent permitted by the law governing mistake and restitution:

1. Recover the payment from the person to whom or for whose benefit payment was made; or

2. In the case of acceptance, may revoke the acceptance.

C. The remedies provided by subsection A or B of this section may not be asserted against a person who took the instrument in good faith and for value or who in good faith changed position in reliance on the payment or acceptance. This subsection does not limit remedies provided by section 47-3417 or 47-4407.

D. Notwithstanding section 47-4215, if an instrument is paid or accepted by mistake and the payor or acceptor recovers payment or revokes acceptance under subsection A or B of this section, the instrument is deemed not to have been paid or accepted and is treated as dishonored, and the person from whom payment is recovered has rights as a person entitled to enforce the dishonored instrument.

#### Section 47-3419. Instruments signed for accommodation

A. If an instrument is issued for value given for the benefit of a party to the instrument ("accommodated party") and another party to the instrument ("accommodation party") signs the instrument for the purpose of incurring liability on the instrument without being a direct beneficiary of the value given for the instrument, the instrument is signed by the accommodation party "for accommodation".

B. An accommodation party may sign the instrument as maker, drawer, acceptor or indorser and, subject to subsection D of this section, is obliged to pay the instrument in the capacity in which the accommodation party signs. The obligation of an accommodation party may be enforced notwithstanding any statute of frauds and whether or not the accommodation party receives consideration for the accommodation.

C. A person signing an instrument is presumed to be an accommodation party and there is notice that the instrument is signed for accommodation if the signature is an anomalous indorsement or is accompanied by words indicating that the signer is acting as surety or guarantor with respect to the obligation of another party to the instrument. Except as provided in section 47-3605, the obligation of an accommodation party to pay the instrument is not affected by the fact that the person enforcing the obligation had notice when the instrument was taken by that person that the accommodation party signed the instrument for accommodation.

D. If the signature of a party to an instrument is accompanied by words indicating unambiguously that the party is guaranteeing collection rather than payment of the obligation of another party to the instrument, the signer is obliged to pay the amount due on the instrument to a person entitled to enforce the instrument only if:

1. Execution of judgment against the other party has been returned unsatisfied;

2. The other party is insolvent or in an insolvency proceeding;

3. The other party cannot be served with process; or

4. It is otherwise apparent that payment cannot be obtained from the other party.

E. An accommodation party who pays the instrument is entitled to reimbursement from the accommodated party and is entitled to enforce the instrument against the accommodated party. An accommodated party who pays the instrument has no right of recourse against, and is not entitled to contribution from, an accommodation party.

#### Section 47-3420. Conversion of instrument

A. The law applicable to conversion of personal property applies to instruments. An instrument is also converted if it is taken by transfer, other than a negotiation, from a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or a bank makes or obtains payment with respect to the instrument for a person not entitled to enforce the instrument or receive payment. An action for conversion of an instrument may not be brought by:

1. The issuer or acceptor of the instrument; or

2. A payee or indorsee who did not receive delivery of the instrument either directly or through delivery to an agent or a co-payee.

B. In an action under subsection A, the measure of liability is presumed to be the amount payable on the instrument, but recovery may not exceed the amount of the plaintiff's interest in the instrument.

C. A representative, other than a depositary bank, who has in good faith dealt with an instrument or its proceeds on behalf of one who was not the person entitled to enforce the instrument is not liable in conversion to that person beyond the amount of any proceeds that it has not paid out.

### Article 5 - Dishonor

#### Section 47-3501. Presentment

A. "Presentment" means a demand made by or on behalf of a person entitled to enforce an instrument:

1. To pay the instrument made to the drawee or a party obliged to pay the instrument or, in the case of a note or accepted draft payable at a bank, to the bank; or

2. To accept a draft made to the drawee.

B. The following rules are subject to chapter 4 of this title, agreement of the parties, and clearing house rules and the like:

1. Presentment:

(a) May be made at the place of payment of the instrument and must be made at the place of payment if the instrument is payable at a bank in the United States;

(b) May be made by any commercially reasonable means, including an oral, written or electronic communication;

(c) Is effective when the demand for payment or acceptance is received by the person to whom presentment is made; and

(d) Is effective if made to any one of two or more makers, acceptors, drawees or other payors.

2. Upon demand of the person to whom presentment is made, the person making presentment must:

(a) Exhibit the instrument;

(b) Give reasonable identification and, if presentment is made on behalf of another person, reasonable evidence of authority to do so; and

(c) Sign a receipt on the instrument for any payment made or surrender the instrument if full payment is made.

3. Without dishonoring the instrument, the party to whom presentment is made may:

(a) Return the instrument for lack of a necessary indorsement; or

(b) Refuse payment or acceptance for failure of the presentment to comply with the terms of the instrument, an agreement of the parties or other applicable law or rule.

4. The party to whom presentment is made may treat presentment as occurring on the next business day after the day of presentment if the party to whom presentment is made has established a cutoff hour not earlier than 2:00 p.m. for the receipt and processing of instruments presented for payment or acceptance and presentment is made after the cutoff hour.

#### Section 47-3502. Dishonor

A. Dishonor of a note is governed by the following rules:

1. If the note is payable on demand, the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made to the maker and the note is not paid on the day of presentment.

2. If the note is not payable on demand and is payable at or through a bank or the terms of the note require presentment, the note is dishonored if presentment is duly made and the note is not paid on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.

3. If the note is not payable on demand and paragraph 2 of this subsection does not apply, the note is dishonored if it is not paid on the day it becomes payable.

B. Dishonor of an unaccepted draft other than a documentary draft is governed by the following rules:

1. If a check is duly presented for payment to the payor bank otherwise than for immediate payment over the counter, the check is dishonored if the payor bank makes timely return of the check or sends timely notice of dishonor or nonpayment under section 47-4301 or 47-4302 or becomes accountable for the amount of the check under section 47-4302.

2. If a draft is payable on demand and paragraph 1 of this subsection does not apply, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.

3. If a draft is payable on a date stated in the draft, the draft is dishonored if:

(a) Presentment for payment is duly made to the drawee and payment is not made on the day the draft becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later; or

(b) Presentment for acceptance is duly made before the day the draft becomes payable and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.

4. If a draft is payable on elapse of a period of time after sight or acceptance, the draft is dishonored if presentment for acceptance is duly made and the draft is not accepted on the day of presentment.

C. Dishonor of an unaccepted documentary draft occurs according to the rules stated in subsection B, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this section, except that payment or acceptance may be delayed without dishonor until no later than the close of the third business day of the drawee following the day on which payment or acceptance is required by those paragraphs.

D. Dishonor of an accepted draft is governed by the following rules:

1. If the draft is payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and the draft is not paid on the day of presentment.

2. If the draft is not payable on demand, the draft is dishonored if presentment for payment is duly made to the acceptor and payment is not made on the day it becomes payable or the day of presentment, whichever is later.

E. In any case in which presentment is otherwise required for dishonor under this section and presentment is excused under section 47-3504, dishonor occurs without presentment if the instrument is not duly accepted or paid.

F. If a draft is dishonored because timely acceptance of the draft was not made and the person entitled to demand acceptance consents to a late acceptance, from the time of acceptance the draft is treated as never having been dishonored.

#### Section 47-3503. Notice of dishonor

A. The obligation of an indorser stated in section 47-3415, subsection A and the obligation of a drawer stated in section 47-3414, subsection D may not be enforced unless:

1. The indorser or drawer is given notice of dishonor of the instrument complying with this section; or

2. Notice of dishonor is excused under section 47-3504, subsection B.

B. Notice of dishonor may be given by any person, may be given by any commercially reasonable means, including an oral, written or electronic communication, and is sufficient if it reasonably identifies the instrument and indicates that the instrument has been dishonored or has not been paid or accepted. Return of an instrument given to a bank for collection is sufficient notice of dishonor.

C. Subject to section 47-3504, subsection C, with respect to an instrument taken for collection by a collecting bank, notice of dishonor must be given by the bank before midnight of the next banking day following the banking day on which the bank receives notice of dishonor of the instrument or by any other person within thirty days following the day on which the person receives notice of dishonor. With respect to any other instrument, notice of dishonor must be given within thirty days following the day on which dishonor occurs.

#### Section 47-3504. Excused presentment and notice of dishonor

A. Presentment for payment or acceptance of an instrument is excused if:

1. The person entitled to present the instrument cannot with reasonable diligence make presentment;

2. The maker or acceptor has repudiated an obligation to pay the instrument or is dead or in insolvency proceedings;

3. By the terms of the instrument presentment is not necessary to enforce the obligation of indorsers or the drawer;

4. The drawer or indorser whose obligation is being enforced has waived presentment or otherwise has no reason to expect or right to require that the instrument be paid or accepted; or

5. The drawer instructed the drawee not to pay or accept the draft or the drawee was not obligated to the drawer to pay the draft.

B. Notice of dishonor is excused if by the terms of the instrument notice of dishonor is not necessary to enforce the obligation of a party to pay the instrument or the party whose obligation is being enforced waived notice of dishonor. A waiver of presentment is also a waiver of notice of dishonor.

C. Delay in giving notice of dishonor is excused if the delay was caused by circumstances beyond the control of the person giving the notice and the person giving the notice exercised reasonable diligence after the cause of the delay ceased to operate.

#### Section 47-3505. Evidence of dishonor

A. The following are admissible as evidence and create a presumption of dishonor and of any notice of dishonor stated:

1. A document regular in form as provided in subsection B which purports to be a protest;

2. A purported stamp or writing of the drawee, payor bank or presenting bank on or accompanying the instrument stating that acceptance or payment has been refused unless reasons for the refusal are stated and the reasons are not consistent with dishonor; and

3. A book or record of the drawee, payor bank or collecting bank, kept in the usual course of business which shows dishonor, even if there is no evidence of who made the entry.

B. A protest is a certificate of dishonor made by a United States consul or vice consul, a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths by the law of the place where dishonor occurs. It may be made upon information satisfactory to that person. The protest must identify the instrument and certify either that presentment has been made or, if not made, the reason why it was not made, and that the instrument has been dishonored by nonacceptance or nonpayment. The protest may also certify that notice of dishonor has been given to some or all parties.

### Article 6 - Discharge and Payment

#### Section 47-3601. Discharge and effect of discharge

A. The obligation of a party to pay the instrument is discharged as stated in this chapter or by an act or agreement with the party which would discharge an obligation to pay money under a simple contract.

B. Discharge of the obligation of a party is not effective against a person acquiring rights of a holder in due course of the instrument without notice of the discharge.

#### Section 47-3602. Payment

A. Subject to subsection B of this section, an instrument is paid to the extent payment is made by or on behalf of a party obliged to pay the instrument and to a person entitled to enforce the instrument. To the extent of the payment, the obligation of the party obliged to pay the instrument is discharged even though payment is made with knowledge of a claim to the instrument under section 47-3306 by another person.

B. The obligation of a party to pay the instrument is not discharged under subsection A of this section if:

1. A claim to the instrument under section 47-3306 is enforceable against the party receiving payment and:

(a) Payment is made with knowledge by the payor that payment is prohibited by injunction or similar process of a court of competent jurisdiction; or

(b) In the case of an instrument other than a cashier's check, teller's check or certified check, the party making payment accepted, from the person having a claim to the instrument, indemnity against loss resulting from refusal to pay the person entitled to enforce the instrument; or

2. The person making payment knows that the instrument is a stolen instrument and pays a person it knows is in wrongful possession of the instrument.

#### Section 47-3603. Tender of payment

A. If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the effect of tender is governed by principles of law applicable to tender of payment under a simple contract.

B. If tender of payment of an obligation to pay an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument and the tender is refused, there is discharge, to the extent of the amount of the tender, of the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse with respect to the obligation to which the tender relates.

C. If tender of payment of an amount due on an instrument is made to a person entitled to enforce the instrument, the obligation of the obligor to pay interest after the due date on the amount tendered is discharged. If presentment is required with respect to an instrument and the obligor is able and ready to pay on the due date at every place of payment stated in the instrument, the obligor is deemed to have made tender of payment on the due date to the person entitled to enforce the instrument.

#### Section 47-3604. Discharge by cancellation or renunciation

A. A person entitled to enforce an instrument, with or without consideration, may discharge the obligation of a party to pay the instrument:

1. By an intentional voluntary act, such as surrender of the instrument to the party, destruction, mutilation or cancellation of the instrument, cancellation or striking out of the party's signature or the addition of words to the instrument indicating discharge; or

2. By agreeing not to sue or otherwise renouncing rights against the party by a signed writing.

B. Cancellation or striking out of an indorsement pursuant to subsection A does not affect the status and rights of a party derived from the indorsement.

#### Section 47-3605. Discharge of indorsers and accommodation parties

A. In this section, the term "indorser" includes a drawer having the obligation described in section 47-3414, subsection D.

B. Discharge, under section 47-3604, of the obligation of a party to pay an instrument does not discharge the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the discharged party.

C. If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to an extension of the due date of the obligation of a party to pay the instrument, the extension discharges an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the party whose obligation is extended to the extent the indorser or accommodation party proves that the extension caused loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse.

D. If a person entitled to enforce an instrument agrees, with or without consideration, to a material modification of the obligation of a party other than an extension of the due date, the modification discharges the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the person whose obligation is modified to the extent the modification causes loss to the indorser or accommodation party with respect to the right of recourse. The loss suffered by the indorser or accommodation party as a result of the modification is equal to the amount of the right of recourse unless the person enforcing the instrument proves that no loss was caused by the modification or that the loss caused by the modification was an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse.

E. If the obligation of a party to pay an instrument is secured by an interest in collateral and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of an indorser or accommodation party having a right of recourse against the obligor is discharged to the extent of the impairment. The value of an interest in collateral is impaired to the extent the value of the interest is reduced to an amount less than the amount of the right of recourse of the party asserting discharge or the reduction in value of the interest causes an increase in the amount by which the amount of the right of recourse exceeds the value of the interest. The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge.

F. If the obligation of a party is secured by an interest in collateral not provided by an accommodation party and a person entitled to enforce the instrument impairs the value of the interest in collateral, the obligation of any party who is jointly and severally liable with respect to the secured obligation is discharged to the extent the impairment causes the party asserting discharge to pay more than that party would have been obliged to pay, taking into account rights of contribution, if impairment had not occurred. If the party asserting discharge is an accommodation party not entitled to discharge under subsection E of this section, the party is deemed to have a right to contribution based on joint and several liability rather than a right to reimbursement. The burden of proving impairment is on the party asserting discharge.

G. Under subsection E or F of this section, impairing value of an interest in collateral includes:

1. Failure to obtain or maintain perfection or recordation of the interest in collateral;

2. Release of collateral without substitution of collateral of equal value;

3. Failure to perform a duty to preserve the value of collateral owed, under chapter 9 of this title or other law, to a debtor or surety or other person secondarily liable; or

4. Failure to comply with applicable law in disposing of collateral.

H. An accommodation party is not discharged under subsection C, D or E of this section unless the person entitled to enforce the instrument knows of the accommodation or has notice under section 47-3419, subsection C that the instrument was signed for accommodation.

I. A party is not discharged under this section if:

1. The party asserting discharge consents to the event or conduct that is the basis of the discharge; or

2. The instrument or a separate agreement of the party provides for waiver of discharge under this section either specifically or by general language indicating that parties waive defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral.

## Chapter 4 - BANK DEPOSITS AND COLLECTIONS

This chapter may be cited as the uniform commercial code -- bank deposits and collections.

#### Section 47-4102. Applicability

A. To the extent that items within this chapter are also within chapters 3 and 8 of this title, they are subject to those chapters. If there is conflict, this chapter governs chapter 3 of this title, but chapter 8 of this title governs this chapter.

B. The liability of a bank for action or non-action with respect to an item handled by it for purposes of presentment, payment or collection is governed by the law of the place where the bank is located. In the case of action or non-action by or at a branch or separate office of a bank, its liability is governed by the law of the place where the branch or separate office is located.

#### Section 47-4103. Variation by agreement; measure of damages; action constituting ordinary care

A. The effect of the provisions of this chapter may be varied by agreement, but the parties to the agreement cannot disclaim a bank's responsibility for its lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care or limit the measure of damages for the lack or failure. However, the parties may determine by agreement the standards by which the bank's responsibility is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable.

B. Federal reserve regulations and operating circulars, clearing-house rules, and the like have the effect of agreements under subsection A, whether or not specifically assented to by all parties interested in items handled.

C. Action or non-action approved by this chapter or pursuant to federal reserve regulations or operating circulars is the exercise of ordinary care and, in the absence of special instructions, action or non-action consistent with clearing-house rules and the like or with a general banking usage not disapproved by this chapter, is prima facie the exercise of ordinary care.

D. The specification or approval of certain procedures by this chapter is not disapproval of other procedures that may be reasonable under the circumstances.

E. The measure of damages for failure to exercise ordinary care in handling an item is the amount of the item reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care. If there is also bad faith it includes any other damages the party suffered as a proximate consequence.

#### Section 47-4106. Payable through or payable at bank; collecting bank

1. The item designates the bank as a collecting bank and does not by itself authorize the bank to pay the item; and

2. The item may be presented for payment only by or through the bank.

B. If an item states that it is "payable at" a bank identified in the item, the item is equivalent to a draft drawn on the bank.

C. If a draft names a nonbank drawee and it is unclear whether a bank named in the draft is a co-drawee or a collecting bank, the bank is a collecting bank.

#### Section 47-4107. Separate office of bank

A branch or separate office of a bank is a separate bank for the purpose of computing the time within which and determining the place at or to which action may be taken or notices or orders must be given under this chapter and chapter 3 of this title, except that service on the bank as garnishee shall be made pursuant to section 12-1577. The receipt of any notice or order by, or the knowledge of, one branch or separate office of a bank is not actual or constructive notice to or knowledge of any other branch or separate office of the same bank and does not impair the right of such other branch or separate office to be a holder in due course of an item.

#### Section 47-4108. Time of receipt of items

A. For the purpose of allowing time to process items, prove balances and make the necessary entries on its books to determine its position for the day, a bank may fix an afternoon hour of two p.m. or later as a cutoff hour for the handling of money and items and the making of entries on its books.

B. An item or deposit of money received on any day after a cutoff hour so fixed or after the close of the banking day may be treated as being received at the opening of the next banking day.

#### Section 47-4109. Delays

A. Unless otherwise instructed, a collecting bank in a good faith effort to secure payment of a specific item drawn on a payor other than a bank, and with or without the approval of any person involved, may waive, modify or extend time limits imposed or permitted by this title for a period not exceeding two additional banking days without discharge of drawers or indorsers or liability to its transferor or a prior party.

B. Delay by a collecting bank or payor bank beyond time limits prescribed or permitted by this title or by instructions is excused if:

1. The delay is caused by interruption of communication or computer facilities, suspension of payments by another bank, war, emergency conditions, failure of equipment or other circumstances beyond the control of the bank; and

2. The bank exercises such diligence as the circumstances require.

#### Section 47-4110. Electronic presentment

A. "Agreement for electronic presentment" means an agreement, clearing-house rule or federal reserve regulation or operating circular providing that presentment of an item may be made by transmission of an image of an item or information describing the item ("presentment notice") rather than delivery of the item itself.

B. Presentment of an item pursuant to an agreement for presentment is made when the presentment notice is received.

C. If presentment is made by presentment notice, a reference to "item" or "check" in this chapter means the presentment notice unless the context otherwise indicates.

### Article 2 - Collection of Items; Depositary and Collecting Banks

#### Section 47-4201. Status of collecting bank as agent and provisional status of credits; applicability of chapter; item indorsed "pay any bank"

A. Unless a contrary intent clearly appears before the time that a settlement given by a collecting bank for an item is or becomes final, the bank, with respect to the item, is an agent or subagent of the owner of the item and any settlement given for the item is provisional. This provision applies regardless of the form of indorsement or lack of indorsement and even though credit given for the item is subject to immediate withdrawal as of right or is in fact withdrawn; but the continuance of ownership of an item by its owner and any rights of the owner to proceeds of the item are subject to rights of a collecting bank, such as those resulting from outstanding advances on the item and rights of recoupment or setoff. If an item is handled by banks for purposes of presentment, payment, collection or return, the relevant provisions of this chapter apply even though action of the parties clearly establishes that a particular bank has purchased the item and is the owner of it.

B. After an item has been indorsed with the words "pay any bank" or the like, only a bank may acquire the rights of a holder until the item has been:

1. Returned to the customer initiating collection; or

2. Specially indorsed by a bank to a person who is not a bank.

#### Section 47-4202. Responsibility for collection or return; when action timely

A. A collecting bank must exercise ordinary care in:

1. Presenting an item or sending it for presentment;

2. Sending notice of dishonor or non-payment or returning an item other than a documentary draft to the bank's transferor after learning that the item has not been paid or accepted, as the case may be;

3. Settling for an item when the bank receives final settlement; and

4. Notifying its transferor of any loss or delay in transit within a reasonable time after discovery thereof.

B. A collecting bank exercises ordinary care under subsection A by taking proper action before its midnight deadline following receipt of an item, notice or settlement. Taking proper action within a reasonably longer time may constitute the exercise of ordinary care, but the bank has the burden of establishing timeliness.

C. Subject to paragraph 1 of subsection A, a bank is not liable for the insolvency, neglect, misconduct, mistake or default of another bank or person or for loss or destruction of an item in the possession of others or in transit.

#### Section 47-4203. Effect of instructions

Subject to chapter 3 of this title concerning conversion of instruments (section 47-3420) and restrictive indorsements (section 47-3206), only a collecting bank's transferor can give instructions that affect the bank or constitute notice to it, and a collecting bank is not liable to prior parties for any action taken pursuant to the instructions or in accordance with any agreement with its transferor.

#### Section 47-4204. Methods of sending and presenting; sending directly to payor bank

A. A collecting bank shall send items by a reasonably prompt method, taking into consideration relevant instructions, the nature of the item, the number of those items on hand, the cost of collection involved and the method generally used by it or others to present those items.

B. A collecting bank may send:

1. An item directly to the payor bank;

2. An item to a non-bank payor if authorized by its transferor; and

3. An item other than documentary drafts to a non-bank payor, if authorized by federal reserve regulation or operating circular, clearing-house rule or the like.

C. Presentment may be made by a presenting bank at a place where the payor bank or other payor has requested that presentment be made.

#### Section 47-4205. Depositary bank holder of unindorsed item

If a customer delivers an item to a depositary bank for collection:

1. The depositary bank becomes a holder of the item at the time it receives the item for collection if the customer at the time of delivery was a holder of the item, whether or not the customer indorses the item, and, if the bank satisfies the other requirements of section 47-3302, it is a holder in due course; and

2. The depositary bank warrants to collecting banks, the payor bank or other payor and the drawer that the amount of the item was paid to the customer or deposited to the customer's account.

#### Section 47-4206. Transfer between banks

Any agreed method that identifies the transferor bank is sufficient for the item's further transfer to another bank.

#### Section 47-4207. Transfer warranties

A. A customer or collecting bank that transfers an item and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that:

1. The warrantor is a person entitled to enforce the item;

2. All signatures on the item are authentic and authorized;

3. The item has not been altered;

4. The item is not subject to a defense or claim in recoupment (section 47-3305, subsection A) of any party that can be asserted against the warrantor; and

5. The warrantor has no knowledge of any insolvency proceeding commenced with respect to the maker or acceptor or, in the case of an unaccepted draft, the drawer.

B. If an item is dishonored, a customer or collecting bank transferring the item and receiving settlement or other consideration is obliged to pay the amount due on the item according to the terms of the item at the time it was transferred, or if the transfer was of an incomplete item, according to its terms when completed as stated in sections 47-3115 and 47-3407. The obligation of a transferor is owed to the transferee and to any subsequent collecting bank that takes the item in good faith. A transferor cannot disclaim its obligation under this subsection by an indorsement stating that it is made "without recourse" or otherwise disclaiming liability.

C. A person to whom the warranties under subsection A of this section are made and who took the item in good faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result of the breach, but not more than the amount of the item plus expenses and loss of interest incurred as a result of the breach.

D. The warranties stated in subsection A of this section cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.

E. A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.

#### Section 47-4208. Presentment warranties

A. If an unaccepted draft is presented to the drawee for payment or acceptance and the drawee pays or accepts the draft, the person obtaining payment or acceptance, at the time of presentment, and a previous transferor of the draft, at the time of transfer, warrant to the drawee that pays or accepts the draft in good faith that:

1. The warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the draft, a person entitled to enforce the draft or authorized to obtain payment or acceptance of the draft on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the draft;

2. The draft has not been altered; and

3. The warrantor has no knowledge that the signature of the purported drawer of the draft is unauthorized.

B. A drawee making payment may recover from a warrantor damages for breach of warranty equal to the amount paid by the drawee less the amount the drawee received or is entitled to receive from the drawer because of the payment. In addition, the drawee is entitled to compensation for expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach. The right of the drawee to recover damages under this subsection is not affected by any failure of the drawee to exercise ordinary care in making payment. If the drawee accepts the draft:

1. Breach of warranty is a defense to the obligation of the acceptor; and

2. If the acceptor makes payment with respect to the draft, the acceptor is entitled to recover from a warrantor for breach of warranty the amounts stated in this subsection.

C. If a drawee asserts a claim for breach of warranty under subsection A of this section based on an unauthorized indorsement of the draft or an alteration of the draft, the warrantor may defend by proving that the indorsement is effective under section 47-3404 or 47-3405 or the drawer is precluded under section 47-3406 or 47-4406 from asserting against the drawee the unauthorized indorsement or alteration.

D. If a dishonored draft is presented for payment to the drawer or an indorser or if any other item is presented for payment to a party obliged to pay the item, and the item is paid, the person obtaining payment and a prior transferor of the item warrant to the person making payment in good faith that the warrantor is, or was, at the time the warrantor transferred the item, a person entitled to enforce the item or authorized to obtain payment on behalf of a person entitled to enforce the item. The person making payment may recover from any warrantor for breach of warranty an amount equal to the amount paid plus expenses and loss of interest resulting from the breach.

E. The warranties stated in subsections A and D of this section cannot be disclaimed with respect to checks. Unless notice of a claim for breach of warranty is given to the warrantor within thirty days after the claimant has reason to know of the breach and the identity of the warrantor, the warrantor is discharged to the extent of any loss caused by the delay in giving notice of the claim.

F. A cause of action for breach of warranty under this section accrues when the claimant has reason to know of the breach.

#### Section 47-4209. Encoding and retention warranties

A. A person who encodes information on or with respect to an item after issue warrants to any subsequent collecting bank and to the payor bank or other payor that the information is correctly encoded. If the customer of a depositary bank encodes, that bank also makes the warranty.

B. A person who undertakes to retain an item pursuant to an agreement for electronic presentment warrants to any subsequent collecting bank and to the payor bank or other payor that retention and presentment of the item comply with the agreement. If a customer of a depositary bank undertakes to retain an item, that bank also makes this warranty.

C. A person to whom warranties are made under this section and who took the item in good faith may recover from the warrantor as damages for breach of warranty an amount equal to the loss suffered as a result of the breach, plus expenses and loss of interest incurred as a result of the breach.

#### Section 47-4210. Security interest of collecting bank in items, accompanying documents and proceeds

A. A collecting bank has a security interest in an item and any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either:

1. In case of an item deposited in an account, to the extent to which credit given for the item has been withdrawn or applied;

2. In case of an item for which it has given credit available for withdrawal as of right, to the extent of the credit given, whether or not the credit is drawn upon or there is a right of charge-back; or

3. If it makes an advance on or against the item.

B. If credit given for several items received at one time or pursuant to a single agreement is withdrawn or applied in part, the security interest remains upon all the items, any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either. For the purpose of this section, credits first given are first withdrawn.

C. Receipt by a collecting bank of a final settlement for an item is a realization on its security interest in the item, accompanying documents and proceeds. So long as the bank does not receive final settlement for the item or give up possession of the item or possession or control of the accompanying documents for purposes other than collection, the security interest continues to that extent and is subject to chapter 9 of this title, but:

1. No security agreement is necessary to make the security interest enforceable (section 47-9203, subsection B, paragraph 3, subdivision (a));

2. No filing is required to perfect the security interests; and

3. The security interest has priority over conflicting perfected security interests in the item, accompanying documents or proceeds.

 

#### Section 47-4211. When bank gives value for purposes of holder in due course

For purposes of determining its status as a holder in due course, a bank has given value to the extent it has a security interest in an item, if the bank otherwise complies with the requirements of section 47-3302 on what constitutes a holder in due course.

#### Section 47-4212. Presentment by notice of item not payable by, through or at a bank; liability of drawer or indorser

A. Unless otherwise instructed, a collecting bank may present an item not payable by, through or at a bank by sending to the party to accept or pay a written notice that the bank holds the item for acceptance or payment. The notice must be sent in time to be received on or before the day when presentment is due and the bank must meet any requirement of the party to accept or pay under section 47-3501 by the close of the bank's next banking day after it knows of the requirement.

B. If presentment is made by notice and payment, acceptance or request for compliance with a requirement under section 47-3501 is not received by the close of business on the day after maturity or, in the case of demand items, by the close of business on the third banking day after notice was sent, the presenting bank may treat the item as dishonored and charge any drawer or indorser by sending it notice of the facts.

#### Section 47-4213. Medium and time of settlement by bank

A. With respect to settlement by a bank, the medium and time of settlement may be prescribed by federal reserve regulations or circulars, clearing-house rules and the like or agreement. In the absence of such prescription:

1. The medium of settlement is cash or credit to an account in a federal reserve bank of or specified by the person to receive settlement; and

2. The time of settlement is:

(a) With respect to tender of settlement by cash, a cashier's check or a teller's check, when the cash or check is sent or delivered;

(b) With respect to tender of settlement by credit in an account in a federal reserve bank, when the credit is made;

(c) With respect to tender of settlement by a credit or debit to an account in a bank, when the credit or debit is made or, in the case of tender of settlement by authority to charge an account, when the authority is sent or delivered; or

(d) With respect to tender of settlement by a funds transfer, when payment is made pursuant to section 47-4A406, subsection A to the person receiving settlement.

B. If the tender of settlement is not by a medium authorized by subsection A of this section or the time of settlement is not fixed by subsection A of this section, no settlement occurs until the tender of settlement is accepted by the person receiving settlement.

C. If settlement for an item is made by cashier's check or teller's check and the person receiving settlement, before its midnight deadline:

1. Presents or forwards the check for collection, settlement is final when the check is finally paid; or

2. Fails to present or forward the check for collection, settlement is final at the midnight deadline of the person receiving settlement.

D. If settlement for an item is made by giving authority to charge the account of the bank giving settlement in the bank receiving settlement, settlement is final when the charge is made by the bank receiving settlement if there are funds available in the account for the amount of the item.

#### Section 47-4214. Right of charge-back or refund; liability of collecting bank; return of item

A. If a collecting bank has made provisional settlement with its customer for an item and fails by reason of dishonor, suspension of payments by a bank or otherwise to receive settlement for the item which is or becomes final, the bank may revoke the settlement given by it, charge back the amount of any credit given for the item to its customer's account or obtain refund from its customer, whether or not it is able to return the item, if by its midnight deadline or within a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts it returns the item or sends notification of the facts. If the return or notice is delayed beyond the bank's midnight deadline or a longer reasonable time after it learns the facts, the bank may revoke the settlement, charge back the credit or obtain refund from its customer, but it is liable for any loss resulting from the delay. These rights to revoke, charge back and obtain refund terminate if and when a settlement for the item received by the bank is or becomes final.

B. A collecting bank returns an item when it is sent or delivered to the bank's customer or transferor or pursuant to its instructions.

C. A depositary bank that is also the payor may charge back the amount of an item to its customer's account or obtain refund in accordance with the section governing return of an item received by a payor bank for credit on its books (section 47-4301).

D. The right to charge back is not affected by:

1. Previous use of a credit given for the item; or

2. Failure by any bank to exercise ordinary care with respect to the item, but a bank so failing remains liable.

E. A failure to charge back or claim refund does not affect other rights of the bank against the customer or any other party.

F. If credit is given in dollars as the equivalent of the value of an item payable in foreign money, the dollar amount of any charge back or refund must be calculated on the basis of the bank-offered spot rate for the foreign money prevailing on the day when the person entitled to the charge back or refund learns that it will not receive payment in ordinary course.

#### Section 47-4215. Final payment of item by payor bank; when provisional debits and credits become final; when certain credits become available for withdrawal

A. An item is finally paid by a payor bank when the bank has first done any of the following:

1. Paid the item in cash;

2. Settled for the item without having a right to revoke the settlement under statute, clearing-house rule or agreement; or

3. Made a provisional settlement for the item and failed to revoke the settlement in the time and manner permitted by statute, clearing-house rule or agreement.

B. If provisional settlement for an item does not become final, the item is not finally paid.

C. If provisional settlement for an item between the presenting and payor banks is made through a clearing house or by debits or credits in an account between them, then to the extent that provisional debits or credits for the item are entered in accounts between the presenting and payor banks or between the presenting and successive prior collecting banks seriatim, they become final upon final payment of the item by the payor bank.

D. If a collecting bank receives a settlement for an item which is or becomes final, the bank is accountable to its customer for the amount of the item and any provisional credit given for the item in an account with its customer becomes final.

E. Subject to applicable law stating a time for availability of funds and any right of the bank to apply the credit to an obligation of the customer, credit given by a bank for an item in a customer's account becomes available for withdrawal as of right:

1. If the bank has received a provisional settlement for the item, when the settlement becomes final and the bank has had a reasonable time to receive return of the item and the item has not been received within that time;

2. If the bank is both the depositary bank and the payor bank and the item is finally paid, at the opening of the bank's second banking day following receipt of the item.

F. Subject to applicable law stating a time for availability of funds and any right of a bank to apply a deposit to an obligation of the depositor, a deposit of money becomes available for withdrawal as of right at the opening of the bank's next banking day after receipt of the deposit.

#### Section 47-4216. Insolvency and preference

A. If an item is in or comes into the possession of a payor or collecting bank that suspends payment and the item has not been finally paid, the item must be returned by the receiver, trustee or agent in charge of the closed bank to the presenting bank or the closed bank's customer.

B. If a payor bank finally pays an item and suspends payments without making a settlement for the item with its customer or the presenting bank which settlement is or becomes final, the owner of the item has a preferred claim against the payor bank.

C. If a payor bank gives or a collecting bank gives or receives a provisional settlement for an item and thereafter suspends payments, the suspension does not prevent or interfere with the settlement's becoming final if the finality occurs automatically upon the lapse of certain time or the happening of certain events.

D. If a collecting bank receives from subsequent parties settlement for an item, which settlement is or becomes final and the bank suspends payments without making a settlement for the item with its customer which settlement is or becomes final, the owner of the item has a preferred claim against the collecting bank.

### Article 3 - Collection of Items; Payor Banks

#### Section 47-4301. Deferred posting; recovery of payment by return of items; time of dishonor; return of items by payor bank

A. If a payor bank settles for a demand item other than a documentary draft presented otherwise than for immediate payment over the counter before midnight of the banking day of receipt, the payor bank may revoke the settlement and recover the settlement if, before it has made final payment and before its midnight deadline, it:

1. Returns the item; or

2. Sends written notice of dishonor or nonpayment if the item is unavailable for return.

B. If a demand item is received by a payor bank for credit on its books, it may return the item or send notice of dishonor and may revoke any credit given or recover the amount thereof withdrawn by its customer, if it acts within the time limit and in the manner specified in subsection A.

C. Unless previous notice of dishonor has been sent an item is dishonored at the time when for purposes of dishonor it is returned or notice sent in accordance with this section.

D. An item is returned:

1. As to an item presented through a clearing house, when it is delivered to the presenting or last collecting bank or to the clearing house or is sent or delivered in accordance with clearing-house rules; or

2. In all other cases, when it is sent or delivered to the bank's customer or transferor or pursuant to instructions.

#### Section 47-4302. Payor bank's responsibility for late return of item

A. If an item is presented to and received by a payor bank, the bank is accountable for the amount of:

1. A demand item, other than a documentary draft, whether properly payable or not, if the bank, in any case in which it is not also the depositary bank, retains the item beyond midnight of the banking day of receipt without settling for it or, whether or not it is also the depositary bank, does not pay or return the item or send notice of dishonor until after its midnight deadline; or

2. Any other properly payable item unless, within the time allowed for acceptance or payment of that item, the bank either accepts or pays the item or returns it and accompanying documents.

B. The liability of a payor bank to pay an item pursuant to subsection A of this section is subject to defenses based on breach of a presentment warranty (section 47-4208) or proof that the person seeking enforcement of the liability presented or transferred the item for the purpose of defrauding the payor bank.

#### Section 47-4303. When items subject to notice, stop-payment order, legal process or setoff; order in which items may be charged or certified

A. Any knowledge, notice or stop-payment order received by, legal process served upon or setoff exercised by a payor bank comes too late to terminate, suspend or modify the bank's right or duty to pay an item or to charge its customer's account for the item if the knowledge, notice, stop-payment order or legal process is received or served and a reasonable time for the bank to act thereon expires or the setoff is exercised after the earliest of the following:

B. Subject to subsection A of this section, items may be accepted, paid, certified or charged to the indicated account of its customer in any order.

### Article 4 - Relationship Between Payor Bank and Its Customer

#### Section 47-4401. When bank may charge customer's account

A. A bank may charge against the account of a customer an item that is properly payable from that account even though the charge creates an overdraft. An item is properly payable if it is authorized by the customer and is in accordance with any agreement between the customer and bank.

B. A customer is not liable for the amount of an overdraft if the customer neither signed the item nor benefited from the proceeds of the item.

C. A bank may charge against the account of a customer a check that is otherwise properly payable from the account, even though payment was made before the date of the check, unless the customer has given notice to the bank of the postdating describing the check with reasonable certainty. The notice is effective for the period stated in section 47-4403, subsection B for stop-payment orders and must be received at such time and in such manner as to afford the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank takes any action with respect to the check described in section 47-4303. If a bank charges against the account of a customer a check before the date stated in the notice of postdating, the bank is liable for damages for the loss resulting from its act. The loss may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under section 47-4402.

D. A bank that in good faith makes payment to a holder may charge the indicated account of its customer according to:

1. The original terms of the altered item; or

2. The terms of the completed item, even though the bank knows the item has been completed unless the bank has notice that the completion was improper.

#### Section 47-4402. Bank's liability to customer for wrongful dishonor; time of determining insufficiency of amount

A. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a payor bank wrongfully dishonors an item if it dishonors an item that is properly payable, but a bank may dishonor an item that would create an overdraft unless it has agreed to pay the overdraft.

B. A payor bank is liable to its customer for damages proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor of an item. Liability is limited to actual damages proved and may include damages for an arrest or prosecution of the customer or other consequential damages. Whether any consequential damages are proximately caused by the wrongful dishonor is a question of fact to be determined in each case.

C. A payor bank's determination of the customer's account balance on which a decision to dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is based may be made at any time between the time the item is received by the payor bank and the time that the payor bank returns the item or gives notice in lieu of return, and no more than one determination need be made. If, at the election of the payor bank, a subsequent balance determination is made for the purpose of reevaluating the bank's decision to dishonor the item, the account balance at that time is determinative of whether a dishonor for insufficiency of available funds is wrongful.

#### Section 47-4403. Customer's right to stop payment; burden of proof of loss

A. A customer or any person authorized to draw on the account if there is more than one person may stop payment of any item drawn on the customer's account or close the account by an order to the bank describing the item or account with reasonable certainty received at a time and in a manner that affords the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before any action by the bank with respect to the item described in section 47-4303. If the signature of more than one person is required to draw on an account, any of these persons may stop payment or close the account.

B. A stop-payment order is effective for six months, but it lapses after fourteen calendar days if the original order was oral and was not confirmed in writing within that period. A stop-payment order may be renewed for additional six month periods by a writing given to the bank within a period during which the stop-payment order is effective.

C. The burden of establishing the fact and amount of loss resulting from the payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order or order to close an account is on the customer. The loss from payment of an item contrary to a stop-payment order may include damages for dishonor of subsequent items under section 47-4402.

#### Section 47-4404. Bank not obligated to pay check more than six months old

A bank is under no obligation to a customer having a checking account to pay a check, other than a certified check, which is presented more than six months after its date, but it may charge its customer's account for a payment made thereafter in good faith.

#### Section 47-4405. Death or incompetence of customer

A. A payor or collecting bank's authority to accept, pay or collect an item or to account for proceeds of its collection, if otherwise effective, is not rendered ineffective by incompetence of a customer of either bank existing at the time the item is issued or its collection is undertaken if the bank does not know of an adjudication of incompetence. Neither death nor incompetence of a customer revokes the authority to accept, pay, collect or account until the bank knows of the fact of death or of an adjudication of incompetence and has reasonable opportunity to act on it.

B. Even with knowledge, a bank may for ten days after the date of death pay or certify checks drawn on or before that date unless ordered to stop payment by a person claiming an interest in the account.

#### Section 47-4406. Customer's duty to discover and report unauthorized signature or alteration

A. A bank that sends or makes available to a customer a statement of account showing payment of items for the account shall either return or make available to the customer the items paid or provide information in the statement of account sufficient to allow the customer reasonably to identify the items paid. The statement of account provides sufficient information if the item is described by item number, amount and date of payment.

B. If the items are not returned to the customer, the person retaining the items shall either retain the items or, if the items are destroyed, maintain the capacity to furnish legible copies of the items until the expiration of seven years after receipt of the items. A customer may request an item from the bank that paid the item, and that bank must provide in a reasonable time either the item or, if the item has been destroyed or is not otherwise obtainable, a legible copy of the item.

C. If a bank sends or makes available a statement of account or items pursuant to subsection A of this section, the customer must exercise reasonable promptness in examining the statement or the items to determine whether any payment was not authorized because of an alteration of an item or because a purported signature by or on behalf of the customer was not authorized. If, based on the statement or items provided, the customer should reasonably have discovered the unauthorized payment, the customer must promptly notify the bank of the relevant facts.

D. If the bank proves that the customer failed, with respect to an item, to comply with the duties imposed on the customer by subsection C of this section, the customer is precluded from asserting against the bank:

1. The customer's unauthorized signature or any alteration on the item, if the bank also proves that it suffered a loss by reason of the failure; and

2. The customer's unauthorized signature or alteration by the same wrongdoer on any other item paid in good faith by the bank if the payment was made before the bank received notice from the customer of the unauthorized signature or alteration and after the customer had been afforded a reasonable period of time, not exceeding thirty days, in which to examine the item or statement of account and notify the bank.

E. If subsection D of this section applies and the customer proves that the bank failed to exercise ordinary care in paying the item and that the failure substantially contributed to loss, the loss is allocated between the customer precluded and the bank asserting the preclusion according to the extent to which the failure of the customer to comply with subsection C of this section and the failure of the bank to exercise ordinary care contributed to the loss. If the customer proves that the bank did not pay the item in good faith, the preclusion under subsection D of this section does not apply.

F. Without regard to care or lack of care of either the customer or the bank, a customer who does not within one year after the statement or items are made available to the customer (subsection A of this section) discover and report the customer's unauthorized signature on or any alteration on the item is precluded from asserting against the bank the unauthorized signature or alteration. If there is a preclusion under this subsection, the payor bank may not recover for breach of warranty under section 47-4208 with respect to the unauthorized signature or alteration to which the preclusion applies.

#### Section 47-4407. Payor bank's right to subrogation on improper payment

If a payor bank has paid an item over the order of the drawer or maker to stop payment, or after an account has been closed or otherwise under circumstances giving a basis for objection by the drawer or maker, to prevent unjust enrichment and only to the extent necessary to prevent loss to the bank by reason of its payment of the item, the payor bank is subrogated to the rights:

1. Of any holder in due course on the item against the drawer or maker;

2. Of the payee or any other holder of the item against the drawer or maker either on the item or under the transaction out of which the item arose; and

3. Of the drawer or maker against the payee or any other holder of the item with respect to the transaction out of which the item arose.

### Article 5 - Collection of Documentary Drafts

#### Section 47-4501. Handling of documentary drafts; duty to send for presentment and to notify customer of dishonor

A bank that takes a documentary draft for collection shall present or send the draft and accompanying documents for presentment and, upon learning that the draft has not been paid or accepted in due course, shall seasonably notify its customer of the fact even though it may have discounted or bought the draft or extended credit available for withdrawal as of right.

#### Section 47-4502. Presentment of "on arrival" drafts

If a draft or the relevant instructions require presentment "on arrival", "when goods arrive" or the like, the collecting bank need not present until in its judgment a reasonable time for arrival of the goods has expired. Refusal to pay or accept because the goods have not arrived is not dishonor; the bank must notify its transferor of the refusal but need not present the draft again until it is instructed to do so or learns of the arrival of the goods.

#### Section 47-4503. Responsibility of presenting bank for documents and goods; report of reasons for dishonor; referee in case of need

Unless otherwise instructed and except as provided in chapter 5 of this title, a bank presenting a documentary draft:

1. Must deliver the documents to the drawee on acceptance of the draft if it is payable more than three days after presentment; otherwise, only on payment; and

2. Upon dishonor, either in the case of presentment for acceptance or presentment for payment, may seek and follow instructions from any referee in case of need designated in the draft or, if the presenting bank does not choose to utilize the referee's services, it must use diligence and good faith to ascertain the reason for dishonor, must notify its transferor of the dishonor and of the results of its effort to ascertain the reasons therefor and must request instructions.

 

However, the presenting bank is under no obligation with respect to goods represented by the documents except to follow any reasonable instructions seasonably received; it has a right to reimbursement for any expense incurred in following instructions and to prepayment of or indemnity for those expenses.

#### Section 47-4504. Privilege of presenting bank to deal with goods; security interest for expenses

A. A presenting bank that, following the dishonor of a documentary draft, has seasonably requested instructions but does not receive them within a reasonable time may store, sell, or otherwise deal with the goods in any reasonable manner.

B. For its reasonable expenses incurred by action under subsection A, the presenting bank has a lien upon the goods or their proceeds, which may be foreclosed in the same manner as an unpaid seller's lien.

If this chapter refers to an execution date or payment date or states a day on which a receiving bank is required to take action, and the date or day does not fall on a funds-transfer business day, the next day that is a funds-transfer business day is treated as the date or day stated, unless the contrary is stated in this chapter.

 

#### Section 47-4A107. Federal reserve regulations and operating circulars

Regulations of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and operating circulars of the federal reserve banks supersede any inconsistent provision of this chapter to the extent of the inconsistency.

#### Section 47-4A108. Relationship to electronic fund transfer act

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, this chapter does not apply to a funds transfer any part of which is governed by the electronic fund transfer act of 1978 (title XX, P.L. 95-630, 92 Stat. 3728, 15 United States Code section 1693 et seq.) as amended from time to time.

B.

C. In a fund transfer to which this article applies, in the event of an inconsistency between an applicable provision of this article and an applicable provision of the electronic fund transfer act, the provision of the electronic fund transfer act governs to the extent of the inconsistency.

 

### Article 2 - Issue and Acceptance of Payment Order

#### Section 47-4A201. Security procedure

"Security procedure" means a procedure established by agreement of a customer and a receiving bank for the purpose of verifying that a payment order or communication amending or cancelling a payment order is that of the customer or detecting error in the transmission or the content of the payment order or communication. A security procedure may require the use of algorithms or other codes, identifying words or numbers, encryption, callback procedures or similar security devices. Comparison of a signature on a payment order or communication with an authorized specimen signature of the customer is not by itself a security procedure.

#### Section 47-4A202. Authorized and verified payment orders

A. A payment order received by the receiving bank is the authorized order of the person identified as sender if that person authorized the order or is otherwise bound by it under the law of agency.

B. If a bank and its customer have agreed that the authenticity of payment orders issued to the bank in the name of the customer as sender will be verified pursuant to a security procedure, a payment order received by the receiving bank is effective as the order of the customer, whether or not authorized, if the security procedure is a commercially reasonable method of providing security against unauthorized payment orders and the bank proves that it accepted the payment order in good faith and in compliance with the security procedure and any written agreement or instruction of the customer restricting acceptance of payment orders issued in the name of the customer. The bank is not required to follow an instruction that violates a written agreement with the customer or notice of which is not received at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the payment order is accepted.

C. Commercial reasonableness of a security procedure is a question of law to be determined by considering the wishes of the customer expressed to the bank, the circumstances of the customer known to the bank, including the size, type and frequency of payment orders normally issued by the customer to the bank, alternative security procedures offered to the customer and security procedures in general use by customers and receiving banks similarly situated. A security procedure is deemed to be commercially reasonable if:

1. The security procedure was chosen by the customer after the bank offered, and the customer refused, a security procedure that was commercially reasonable for that customer; and

2. The customer expressly agreed in writing to be bound by any payment order, whether or not authorized, issued in its name and accepted by the bank in compliance with the security procedure chosen by the customer.

D. The term "sender" in this chapter includes the customer in whose name a payment order is issued if the order is the authorized order of the customer under subsection A of this section, or it is effective as the order of the customer under subsection B of this section.

E. This section applies to amendments and cancellations of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.

F. Except as provided in this section and in section 47-4A203, subsection A, paragraph 1, rights and obligations arising under this section or section 47-4A203 may not be varied by agreement.

#### Section 47-4A203. Unenforceability of certain verified payment orders

A. If an accepted payment order is not, under section 47-4A202, subsection A, an authorized order of a customer identified as sender, but is effective as an order of the customer pursuant to section 47-4A202, subsection B, the following rules apply:

1. By express written agreement, the receiving bank may limit the extent to which it is entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order.

2. The receiving bank is not entitled to enforce or retain payment of the payment order if the customer proves that the order was not caused, directly or indirectly, by a person entrusted at any time with duties to act for the customer with respect to payment orders or the security procedure or who obtained access to transmitting facilities of the customer or who obtained, from a source controlled by the customer and without authority of the receiving bank, information facilitating breach of the security procedure, regardless of how the information was obtained or whether the customer was at fault. Information includes any access device, computer software or the like.

B. This section applies to amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.

#### Section 47-4A204. Refund of payment and duty of customer to report with respect to unauthorized payment order

A. If a receiving bank accepts a payment order issued in the name of its customer as sender which is not authorized and not effective as the order of the customer under section 47-4A202 or not enforceable, in whole or in part, against the customer under section 47-4A203, the bank shall refund any payment of the payment order received from the customer to the extent the bank is not entitled to enforce payment and shall pay interest on the refundable amount calculated from the date the bank received payment to the date of the refund. However, the customer is not entitled to interest from the bank on the amount to be refunded if the customer fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized by the customer and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding ninety days after the date the customer received notification from the bank that the order was accepted or that the customer's account was debited with respect to the order. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the customer on account of a failure by the customer to give notification as stated in this section.

B. Reasonable time under subsection A of this section may be fixed by agreement as stated in section 47-1302, subsection B, but the obligation of a receiving bank to refund payment as stated in subsection A of this section may not otherwise be varied by agreement.

 

#### Section 47-4A205. Erroneous payment orders

A. If an accepted payment order was transmitted pursuant to a security procedure for the detection of error and the payment order erroneously instructed payment to a beneficiary not intended by the sender, erroneously instructed payment in an amount greater than the amount intended by the sender or was an erroneously transmitted duplicate of a payment order previously sent by the sender, the following rules apply:

1. If the sender proves that the sender or a person acting on behalf of the sender pursuant to section 47-4A206 complied with the security procedure and that the error would have been detected if the receiving bank had also complied, the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent stated in paragraphs 2 and 3.

2. If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of a payment order that erroneously instructed payment to a beneficiary not intended by the sender or that was an erroneously transmitted duplicate of a payment order previously sent by the sender, the sender is not obliged to pay the order and the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.

3. If the funds transfer is completed on the basis of a payment order that erroneously instructed payment in an amount greater than the amount intended by the sender, the sender is not obliged to pay the order to the extent the amount received by the beneficiary is greater than the amount intended by the sender. In that case, the receiving bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary the excess amount received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.

B. If the sender of an erroneous payment order described in subsection A of this section is not obliged to pay all or part of the order and the sender receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was accepted by the bank or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care, on the basis of information available to the sender, to discover the error with respect to the order and to advise the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time, not exceeding ninety days, after the bank's notification was received by the sender. If the bank proves that the sender failed to perform that duty, the sender is liable to the bank for the loss the bank proves it incurred as a result of the failure, but the liability of the sender may not exceed the amount of the sender's order.

C. This section applies to amendments to payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.

#### Section 47-4A206. Transmission of payment order through funds-transfer or other communication system

A. If a payment order addressed to a receiving bank is transmitted to a funds-transfer system or other third-party communication system for transmittal to the bank, the system is deemed to be an agent of the sender for the purpose of transmitting the payment order to the bank. If there is a discrepancy between the terms of the payment order transmitted to the system and the terms of the payment order transmitted by the system to the bank, the terms of the payment order of the sender are those transmitted by the system. This section does not apply to a funds-transfer system of the federal reserve banks.

B. This section applies to cancellations and amendments of payment orders to the same extent it applies to payment orders.

#### Section 47-4A207. Misdescription of beneficiary

A. Subject to subsection B, if, in a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank, the name, bank account number or other identification of the beneficiary refers to a nonexistent or unidentifiable person or account, no person has rights as a beneficiary of the order and acceptance of the order cannot occur.

B. If a payment order received by the beneficiary's bank identifies the beneficiary both by name and by an identifying or bank account number and the name and number identify different persons, the following rules apply:

1. Except as otherwise provided in subsection C, if the beneficiary's bank does not know that the name and number refer to different persons, it may rely on the number as the proper identification of the beneficiary of the order. The beneficiary's bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.

2. If the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by name or knows that the name and number identify different persons, no person has rights as beneficiary except the person paid by the beneficiary's bank if that person was entitled to receive payment from the originator of the funds transfer. If no person has rights as beneficiary, acceptance of the order cannot occur.

C. If a payment order described in subsection B is accepted, the originator's payment order described the beneficiary inconsistently by name and number and the beneficiary's bank pays the person identified by number as permitted by subsection B, paragraph 1, the following rules apply:

1. If the originator is a bank, the originator is obliged to pay its order.

2. If the originator is not a bank and proves that the person identified by number was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the originator is not obliged to pay its order unless the originator's bank proves that the originator, before acceptance of the originator's order, had notice that payment of a payment order issued by the originator might be made by the beneficiary's bank on the basis of an identifying or bank account number even if it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The originator's bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the originator, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates.

D. In a case governed by subsection B, paragraph 1, if the beneficiary's bank rightfully pays the person identified by number and that person was not entitled to receive payment from the originator, the amount paid may be recovered from that person to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution as follows:

1. If the originator is obliged to pay its payment order as stated in subsection C, the originator has the right to recover.

2. If the originator is not a bank and is not obliged to pay its payment order, the originator's bank has the right to recover.

#### Section 47-4A208. Misdescription of intermediary bank or beneficiary's bank

A. The following rules apply to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank only by an identifying number:

1. The receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank and need not determine whether the number identifies a bank.

2. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.

B. The following rules apply to a payment order identifying an intermediary bank or the beneficiary's bank both by name and an identifying number if the name and number identify different persons:

1. If the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, when it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person or whether the number refers to a bank. The sender is obliged to compensate the receiving bank for any loss and expenses incurred by the receiving bank as a result of its reliance on the number in executing or attempting to execute the order.

2. If the sender is not a bank and the receiving bank proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, had notice that the receiving bank might rely on the number as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank even if it identifies a person different from the bank identified by name, the rights and obligations of the sender and the receiving bank are governed by subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section, as though the sender were a bank. Proof of notice may be made by any admissible evidence. The receiving bank satisfies the burden of proof if it proves that the sender, before the payment order was accepted, signed a writing stating the information to which the notice relates.

3. Regardless of whether the sender is a bank, the receiving bank may rely on the name as the proper identification of the intermediary or beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank, at the time it executes the sender's order, does not know that the name and number identify different persons. The receiving bank need not determine whether the name and number refer to the same person.

4. If the receiving bank knows that the name and number identify different persons, reliance on either the name or the number in executing the sender's payment order is a breach of the obligation stated in section 47-4A302, subsection A, paragraph 1.

#### Section 47-4A209. Acceptance of payment order

A. Subject to subsection D of this section, a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order when it executes the order.

B. Subject to subsections C and D of this section, a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order at the earliest of the following times:

1. When the bank:

(a) Pays the beneficiary as stated in section 47-4A405, subsection A or B; or

(b) Notifies the beneficiary of receipt of the order or that the account of the beneficiary has been credited with respect to the order unless the notice indicates that the bank is rejecting the order or that funds with respect to the order may not be withdrawn or used until receipt of payment from the sender of the order;

2. When the bank receives payment of the entire amount of the sender's order pursuant to section 47-4A403, subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2; or

3. The opening of the next funds-transfer business day of the bank following the payment date of the order if, at that time, the amount of the sender's order is fully covered by a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender or the bank has otherwise received full payment from the sender, unless the order was rejected before that time or is rejected within one hour after that time or one hour after the opening of the next business day of the sender following the payment date if that time is later. If notice of rejection is received by the sender after the payment date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the payment date to the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not accepted, counting that day as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest payable is reduced accordingly.

C. Acceptance of a payment order cannot occur before the order is received by the receiving bank. Acceptance does not occur under subsection B, paragraph 2 or 3 of this section if the beneficiary of the payment order does not have an account with the receiving bank, the account has been closed or the receiving bank is not permitted by law to receive credits for the beneficiary's account.

D. A payment order issued to the originator's bank cannot be accepted until the payment date if the bank is the beneficiary's bank, or the execution date if the bank is not the beneficiary's bank. If the originator's bank executes the originator's payment order before the execution date or pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order before the payment date and the payment order is subsequently canceled pursuant to section 47-4A211, subsection B, the bank may recover from the beneficiary any payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.

#### Section 47-4A210. Rejection of payment order

A. A payment order is rejected by the receiving bank by a notice of rejection transmitted to the sender orally, electronically or in writing. A notice of rejection need not use any particular words and is sufficient if it indicates that the receiving bank is rejecting the order or will not execute or pay the order. Rejection is effective when the notice is given if transmission is by a means that is reasonable in the circumstances. If notice of rejection is given by a means that is not reasonable, rejection is effective when the notice is received. If an agreement of the sender and receiving bank establishes the means to be used to reject a payment order:

1. Any means complying with the agreement is reasonable; and

2. Any means not complying is not reasonable unless no significant delay in receipt of the notice resulted from the use of the noncomplying means.

B. This subsection applies if a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank fails to execute a payment order despite the existence on the execution date of a withdrawable credit balance in an authorized account of the sender sufficient to cover the order. If the sender does not receive notice of rejection of the order on the execution date and the authorized account of the sender does not bear interest, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the sender on the amount of the order for the number of days elapsing after the execution date to the earlier of the day the order is canceled pursuant to section 47-4A211, subsection D or the day the sender receives notice or learns that the order was not executed, counting the final day of the period as an elapsed day. If the withdrawable credit balance during that period falls below the amount of the order, the amount of interest is reduced accordingly.

C. If a receiving bank suspends payments, all unaccepted payment orders issued to it are deemed rejected at the time the bank suspends payments.

D. Acceptance of a payment order precludes a later rejection of the order. Rejection of a payment order precludes a later acceptance of the order.

#### Section 47-4A211. Cancellation and amendment of payment order

A. A communication of the sender of a payment order cancelling or amending the order may be transmitted to the receiving bank orally, electronically or in writing. If a security procedure is in effect between the sender and the receiving bank, the communication is not effective to cancel or amend the order unless the communication is verified pursuant to the security procedure or the bank agrees to the cancellation or amendment.

B. Subject to subsection A, a communication by the sender cancelling or amending a payment order is effective to cancel or amend the order if notice of the communication is received at a time and in a manner affording the receiving bank a reasonable opportunity to act on the communication before the bank accepts the payment order.

C. After a payment order has been accepted, cancellation or amendment of the order is not effective unless the receiving bank agrees or a funds-transfer system rule allows cancellation or amendment without agreement of the bank and:

1. With respect to a payment order accepted by a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless a conforming cancellation or amendment of the payment order issued by the receiving bank is also made.

2. With respect to a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, cancellation or amendment is not effective unless the order was issued in execution of an unauthorized payment order, or because of a mistake by a sender in the funds transfer which resulted in the issuance of a payment order that is a duplicate of a payment order previously issued by the sender, that orders payment to a beneficiary not entitled to receive payment from the originator or that orders payment in an amount greater than the amount the beneficiary was entitled to receive from the originator. If the payment order is canceled or amended, the beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary any amount paid to the beneficiary to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.

D. An unaccepted payment order is canceled by operation of law at the close of the fifth funds-transfer business day of the receiving bank after the execution date or payment date of the order.

E. A canceled payment order cannot be accepted. If an accepted payment order is canceled, the acceptance is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance. Amendment of a payment order is deemed to be cancellation of the original order at the time of amendment and issue of a new payment order in the amended form at the same time.

F. Unless otherwise provided in an agreement of the parties or in a funds-transfer system rule, if the receiving bank, after accepting a payment order, agrees to cancellation or amendment of the order by the sender or is bound by a funds-transfer system rule allowing cancellation or amendment without the bank's agreement, the sender, whether or not cancellation or amendment is effective, is liable to the bank for any loss and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees, incurred by the bank as a result of the cancellation or amendment or attempted cancellation or amendment.

G. A payment order is not revoked by the death or legal incapacity of the sender unless the receiving bank knows of the death or of an adjudication of incapacity by a court of competent jurisdiction and has reasonable opportunity to act before acceptance of the order.

H. A funds-transfer system rule is not effective to the extent it conflicts with subsection C, paragraph 2.

#### Section 47-4A212. Liability and duty of receiving bank regarding unaccepted payment order

If a receiving bank fails to accept a payment order that it is obliged by express agreement to accept, the bank is liable for breach of the agreement to the extent provided in the agreement or in this chapter, but does not otherwise have any duty to accept a payment order or, before acceptance, to take any action, or refrain from taking action, with respect to the order except as provided in this chapter or by express agreement. Liability based on acceptance arises only when acceptance occurs as stated in section 47-4A209, and liability is limited to that provided in this chapter. A receiving bank is not the agent of the sender or beneficiary of the payment order it accepts, or of any other party to the funds transfer, and the bank owes no duty to any party to the funds transfer except as provided in this chapter or by express agreement.

### Article 3 - Execution of Sender's Payment Order by Receiving Bank

#### Section 47-4A301. Execution and execution date

A. A payment order is "executed" by the receiving bank when it issues a payment order intended to carry out the payment order received by the bank. A payment order received by the beneficiary's bank can be accepted but cannot be executed.

B. "Execution date" of a payment order means the day on which the receiving bank may properly issue a payment order in execution of the sender's order. The execution date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received. If the sender's instruction states a payment date, the execution date is the payment date or an earlier date on which execution is reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date.

#### Section 47-4A302. Obligations of receiving bank in execution of payment order

A. Except as provided in subsections B, C and D of this section, if the receiving bank accepts a payment order pursuant to section 47-4A209, subsection A, the bank has the following obligations in executing the order:

1. The receiving bank is obliged to issue, on the execution date, a payment order complying with the sender's order and to follow the sender's instructions concerning any intermediary bank or funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer or the means by which payment orders are to be transmitted in the funds transfer. If the originator's bank issues a payment order to an intermediary bank, the originator's bank is obliged to instruct the intermediary bank according to the instruction of the originator. An intermediary bank in the funds transfer is similarly bound by an instruction given to it by the sender of the payment order it accepts.

2. If the sender's instruction states that the funds transfer is to be carried out telephonically or by wire transfer or otherwise indicates that the funds transfer is to be carried out by the most expeditious means, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order by the most expeditious available means, and to instruct any intermediary bank accordingly. If a sender's instruction states a payment date, the receiving bank is obliged to transmit its payment order at a time and by means reasonably necessary to allow payment to the beneficiary on the payment date or as soon thereafter as is feasible.

B. Unless otherwise instructed, a receiving bank executing a payment order may use any funds-transfer system if use of that system is reasonable in the circumstances and issue a payment order to the beneficiary's bank or to an intermediary bank through which a payment order conforming to the sender's order can expeditiously be issued to the beneficiary's bank if the receiving bank exercises ordinary care in the selection of the intermediary bank. A receiving bank is not required to follow an instruction of the sender designating a funds-transfer system to be used in carrying out the funds transfer if the receiving bank, in good faith, determines that it is not feasible to follow the instruction or that following the instruction would unduly delay completion of the funds transfer.

C. Unless subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section applies or the receiving bank is otherwise instructed, the bank may execute a payment order by transmitting its payment order by first class mail or by any means reasonable in the circumstances. If the receiving bank is instructed to execute the sender's order by transmitting its payment order by a particular means, the receiving bank may issue its payment order by the means stated or by any means as expeditious as the means stated.

D. Unless instructed by the sender, the receiving bank:

1. May not obtain payment of its charges for services and expenses in connection with the execution of the sender's order by issuing a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the sender's order less the amount of the charges; and

2. May not instruct a subsequent receiving bank to obtain payment of its charges in the same manner.

#### Section 47-4A303. Erroneous execution of payment order

A. A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount greater than the amount of the sender's order, or issues a payment order in execution of the sender's order and then issues a duplicate order, is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under section 47-4A402, subsection C if that subsection is otherwise satisfied. The bank is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the erroneous order the excess payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.

B. A receiving bank that executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order is entitled to payment of the amount of the sender's order under section 47-4A402, subsection C if that subsection is otherwise satisfied and the bank corrects its mistake by issuing an additional payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary of the sender's order. If the error is not corrected, the issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the order it accepted only to the extent of the amount of the erroneous order. This subsection does not apply if the receiving bank executes the sender's payment order by issuing a payment order in an amount less than the amount of the sender's order for the purpose of obtaining payment of its charges for services and expenses pursuant to instruction of the sender.

C. If a receiving bank executes the payment order of the sender by issuing a payment order to a beneficiary different from the beneficiary of the sender's order and the funds transfer is completed on the basis of that error, the sender of the payment order that was erroneously executed and all previous senders in the funds transfer are not obliged to pay the payment orders they issued. The issuer of the erroneous order is entitled to recover from the beneficiary of the order the payment received to the extent allowed by the law governing mistake and restitution.

#### Section 47-4A304. Duty of sender to report erroneously executed payment order

If the sender of a payment order that is erroneously executed as stated in section 47-4A303 receives notification from the receiving bank that the order was executed or that the sender's account was debited with respect to the order, the sender has a duty to exercise ordinary care to determine, on the basis of information available to the sender, that the order was erroneously executed and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding ninety days after the notification from the bank was received by the sender. If the sender fails to perform that duty, the bank is not obliged to pay interest on any amount refundable to the sender under section 47-4A402, subsection D for the period before the bank learns of the execution error. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the sender on account of a failure by the sender to perform the duty stated in this section.

#### Section 47-4A305. Liability for late or improper execution or failure to execute payment order

A. If a funds transfer is completed but execution of a payment order by the receiving bank in breach of section 47-4A302 results in delay in payment to the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to pay interest to either the originator or the beneficiary of the funds transfer for the period of delay caused by the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, additional damages are not recoverable.

B. If execution of a payment order by a receiving bank in breach of section 47-4A302 results in noncompletion of the funds transfer, failure to use an intermediary bank designated by the originator or issuance of a payment order that does not comply with the terms of the payment order of the originator, the bank is liable to the originator for its expenses in the funds transfer and for incidental expenses and interest losses, to the extent not covered by subsection A of this section, resulting from the improper execution. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, additional damages are not recoverable.

C. In addition to the amounts payable under subsections A and B of this section, damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank.

D. If a receiving bank fails to execute a payment order it was obliged by express agreement to execute, the receiving bank is liable to the sender for its expenses in the transaction and for incidental expenses and interest losses resulting from the failure to execute. Additional damages, including consequential damages, are recoverable to the extent provided in an express written agreement of the receiving bank, but are not otherwise recoverable.

E. Reasonable attorney fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection A or B of this section is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim. If a claim is made for breach of an agreement under subsection D of this section and the agreement does not provide for damages, reasonable attorney fees are recoverable if demand for compensation under subsection D of this section is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.

F. Except as stated in this section, the liability of a receiving bank under subsections A and B of this section may not be varied by agreement.

### Article 4 - Payment

#### Section 47-4A401. Payment date

"Payment date" of a payment order means the day on which the amount of the order is payable to the beneficiary by the beneficiary's bank. The payment date may be determined by instruction of the sender but cannot be earlier than the day the order is received by the beneficiary's bank and, unless otherwise determined, is the day the order is received by the beneficiary's bank.

#### Section 47-4A402. Obligation of sender to pay receiving bank

A. This section is subject to sections 47-4A205 and 47-4A207.

B. With respect to a payment order issued to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the order, but payment is not due until the payment date of the order.

C. This subsection is subject to subsection E of this section and to section 47-4A303. With respect to a payment order issued to a receiving bank other than the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the order by the receiving bank obliges the sender to pay the bank the amount of the sender's order. Payment by the sender is not due until the execution date of the sender's order. The obligation of that sender to pay its payment order is excused if the funds transfer is not completed by acceptance by the beneficiary's bank of a payment order instructing payment to the beneficiary of that sender's payment order.

D. If the sender of a payment order pays the order and was not obliged to pay all or part of the amount paid, the bank receiving payment is obliged to refund payment to the extent the sender was not obliged to pay. Except as provided in sections 47-4A204 and 47-4A304, interest is payable on the refundable amount from the date of payment.

E. If a funds transfer is not completed as stated in subsection C of this section and an intermediary bank is obliged to refund payment as stated in subsection D of this section but is unable to do so because not permitted by applicable law or because the bank suspends payments, a sender in the funds transfer that executed a payment order in compliance with an instruction, as stated in section 47-4A302, subsection A, paragraph 1, to route the funds transfer through that intermediary bank is entitled to receive or retain payment from the sender of the payment order that it accepted. The first sender in the funds transfer that issued an instruction requiring routing through that intermediary bank is subrogated to the right of the bank that paid the intermediary bank to refund as stated in subsection D of this section.

F. The right of the sender of a payment order to be excused from the obligation to pay the order as stated in subsection C of this section or to receive refund under subsection D of this section may not be varied by agreement.

#### Section 47-4A403. Payment by sender to receiving bank

A. Payment of the sender's obligation under section 47-4A402 to pay the receiving bank occurs as follows:

1. If the sender is a bank, payment occurs when the receiving bank receives final settlement of the obligation through a federal reserve bank or through a funds-transfer system.

2. If the sender is a bank and the sender credited an account of the receiving bank with the sender or caused an account of the receiving bank in another bank to be credited, payment occurs when the credit is withdrawn or, if not withdrawn, at midnight of the day on which the credit is withdrawable and the receiving bank learns of that fact.

3. If the receiving bank debits an account of the sender with the receiving bank, payment occurs when the debit is made to the extent the debit is covered by a withdrawable credit balance in the account.

B. If the sender and receiving bank are members of a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants, the receiving bank receives final settlement when settlement is complete in accordance with the rules of the system. The obligation of the sender to pay the amount of a payment order transmitted through the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against the sender's obligation the right of the sender to receive payment from the receiving bank of the amount of any other payment order transmitted to the sender by the receiving bank through the funds-transfer system. The aggregate balance of obligations owed by each sender to each receiving bank in the funds-transfer system may be satisfied, to the extent permitted by the rules of the system, by setting off and applying against that balance the aggregate balance of obligations owed to the sender by other members of the system. The aggregate balance is determined after the right of setoff stated in the second sentence of this subsection has been exercised.

C. If two banks transmit payment orders to each other under an agreement that settlement of the obligations of each bank to the other under section 47-4A402 will be made at the end of the day or other period, the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by one bank shall be set off against the total amount owed with respect to all orders transmitted by the other bank. To the extent of the setoff, each bank has made payment to the other.

D. In a case not covered by subsection A of this section, the time when payment of the sender's obligation under section 47-4A402, subsection B or C occurs is governed by applicable principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.

#### Section 47-4A404. Obligation of beneficiary's bank to pay and give notice to beneficiary

A. Subject to section 47-4A211, subsection E and section 47-4A405, subsections D and E, if a beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order, the bank is obliged to pay the amount of the order to the beneficiary of the order. Payment is due on the payment date of the order, but if acceptance occurs on the payment date after the close of the funds-transfer business day of the bank, payment is due on the next funds-transfer business day. If the bank refuses to pay after demand by the beneficiary and receipt of notice of particular circumstances that will give rise to consequential damages as a result of nonpayment, the beneficiary may recover damages resulting from the refusal to pay to the extent the bank had notice of the damages, unless the bank proves that it did not pay because of a reasonable doubt concerning the right of the beneficiary to payment.

B. If a payment order accepted by the beneficiary's bank instructs payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is obliged to notify the beneficiary of receipt of the order before midnight of the next funds-transfer business day following the payment date. If the payment order does not instruct payment to an account of the beneficiary, the bank is required to notify the beneficiary only if notice is required by the order. Notice may be given by first class mail or any other means reasonable in the circumstances. If the bank fails to give the required notice, the bank is obliged to pay interest to the beneficiary on the amount of the payment order from the day notice should have been given until the day the beneficiary learned of receipt of the payment order by the bank. No other damages are recoverable. Reasonable attorney fees are also recoverable if demand for interest is made and refused before an action is brought on the claim.

C. The right of a beneficiary to receive payment and damages as stated in subsection A of this section may not be varied by agreement or a funds-transfer system rule. The right of a beneficiary to be notified as stated in subsection B of this section may be varied by agreement of the beneficiary or by a funds-transfer system rule if the beneficiary is notified of the rule before initiation of the funds transfer.

#### Section 47-4A405. Payment by beneficiary's bank to beneficiary

A. If the beneficiary's bank credits an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, payment of the bank's obligation under section 47-4A404, subsection A occurs when and to the extent:

1. The beneficiary is notified of the right to withdraw the credit;

2. The bank lawfully applies the credit to a debt of the beneficiary; or

3. Funds with respect to the order are otherwise made available to the beneficiary by the bank.

B. If the beneficiary's bank does not credit an account of the beneficiary of a payment order, the time when payment of the bank's obligation under section 47-4A404, subsection A occurs is governed by principles of law that determine when an obligation is satisfied.

C. Except as stated in subsections D and E of this section, if the beneficiary's bank pays the beneficiary of a payment order under a condition to payment or agreement of the beneficiary giving the bank the right to recover payment from the beneficiary if the bank does not receive payment of the order, the condition to payment or agreement is not enforceable.

D. A funds-transfer system rule may provide that payments made to beneficiaries of funds transfers made through the system are provisional until receipt of payment by the beneficiary's bank of the payment order it accepted. A beneficiary's bank that makes a payment that is provisional under the rule is entitled to refund from the beneficiary if the rule requires that both the beneficiary and the originator be given notice of the provisional nature of the payment before the funds transfer is initiated, the beneficiary, the beneficiary's bank and the originator's bank agreed to be bound by the rule and the beneficiary's bank did not receive payment of the payment order that it accepted. If the beneficiary is obliged to refund payment to the beneficiary's bank, acceptance of the payment order by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no payment by the originator of the funds transfer to the beneficiary occurs under section 47-4A406.

E. This subsection applies to a funds transfer that includes a payment order transmitted over a funds-transfer system that nets obligations multilaterally among participants and has in effect a loss-sharing agreement among participants for the purpose of providing funds necessary to complete settlement of the obligations of one or more participants that do not meet their settlement obligations. If the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer accepts a payment order and the system fails to complete settlement pursuant to its rules with respect to any payment order in the funds transfer:

1. The acceptance by the beneficiary's bank is nullified and no person has any right or obligation based on the acceptance;

2. The beneficiary's bank is entitled to recover payment from the beneficiary;

3. No payment by the originator to the beneficiary occurs under section 47-4A406; and

4. Subject to section 47-4A402, subsection E, each sender in the funds transfer is excused from its obligation to pay its payment order under section 47-4A402, subsection C because the funds transfer has not been completed.

#### Section 47-4A406. Payment by originator to beneficiary; discharge of underlying obligation

A. Subject to section 47-4A211, subsection E and section 47-4A405, subsections D and E, the originator of a funds transfer pays the beneficiary of the originator's payment order at the time a payment order for the benefit of the beneficiary is accepted by the beneficiary's bank in the funds transfer and in an amount equal to the amount of the order accepted by the beneficiary's bank, but not more than the amount of the originator's order.

B. If payment under subsection A of this section is made to satisfy an obligation, the obligation is discharged to the same extent discharge would result from payment to the beneficiary of the same amount in money, unless the payment under subsection A of this section was made by a means prohibited by the contract of the beneficiary with respect to the obligation, the beneficiary, within a reasonable time after receiving notice of receipt of the order by the beneficiary's bank, notified the originator of the beneficiary's refusal of the payment, funds with respect to the order were not withdrawn by the beneficiary or applied to a debt of the beneficiary and the beneficiary would suffer a loss that could reasonably have been avoided if payment had been made by a means complying with the contract. If payment by the originator does not result in discharge under this section, the originator is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to receive payment from the beneficiary's bank under section 47-4A404, subsection A.

C. For the purpose of determining whether discharge of an obligation occurs under subsection B of this section, if the beneficiary's bank accepts a payment order in an amount equal to the amount of the originator's payment order less charges of one or more receiving banks in the funds transfer, payment to the beneficiary is deemed to be in the amount of the originator's order unless upon demand by the beneficiary the originator does not pay the beneficiary the amount of the deducted charges.

D. Rights of the originator or of the beneficiary of a funds transfer under this section may be varied only by agreement of the originator and the beneficiary.

### Article 5 - Miscellaneous Provisions

#### Section 47-4A501. Variation by agreement and effect of funds-transfer system rule

A. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the rights and obligations of a party to a funds transfer may be varied by agreement of the affected party.

B. "Funds-transfer system rule" means a rule of an association of banks governing transmission of payment orders by means of a funds-transfer system of the association or rights and obligations with respect to those orders or to the extent the rule governs rights and obligations between banks that are parties to a funds transfer in which a federal reserve bank, acting as an intermediary bank, sends a payment order to the beneficiary's bank. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a funds-transfer system rule governing rights and obligations between participating banks using the system may be effective even if the rule conflicts with this chapter and indirectly affects another party to the funds transfer who does not consent to the rule. A funds-transfer system rule may also govern rights and obligations of parties other than participating banks using the system to the extent stated in section 47-4A404, subsection C, section 47-4A405, subsection D and section 47-4A507, subsection C.

#### Section 47-4A502. Creditor process served on receiving bank; setoff by beneficiary's bank

A. As used in this section, "creditor process" means levy, attachment, garnishment, notice of lien, sequestration or similar process issued by or on behalf of a creditor or other claimant with respect to an account.

B. This subsection applies to creditor process with respect to an authorized account of the sender of a payment order if the creditor process is served on the receiving bank. For the purpose of determining rights with respect to the creditor process, if the receiving bank accepts the payment order the balance in the authorized account is deemed to be reduced by the amount of the payment order to the extent the bank did not otherwise receive payment of the order, unless the creditor process is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act on it before the bank accepts the payment order.

C. If a beneficiary's bank has received a payment order for payment to the beneficiary's account in the bank, the following rules apply:

1. The bank may credit the beneficiary's account. The amount credited may be set off against an obligation owed by the beneficiary to the bank or may be applied to satisfy creditor process served on the bank with respect to the account.

2. The bank may credit the beneficiary's account and allow withdrawal of the amount credited unless creditor process with respect to the account is served at a time and in a manner affording the bank a reasonable opportunity to act to prevent withdrawal.

3. If creditor process with respect to the beneficiary's account has been served and the bank has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it, the bank may not reject the payment order except for a reason unrelated to the service of process.

D. Creditor process with respect to a payment by the originator to the beneficiary pursuant to a funds transfer may be served only on the beneficiary's bank with respect to the debt owed by that bank to the beneficiary. Any other bank served with the creditor process is not obliged to act with respect to the process.

#### Section 47-4A503. Injunction or restraining order with respect to funds transfer

For proper cause and in compliance with applicable law, a court may restrain a person from issuing a payment order to initiate a funds transfer, an originator's bank from executing the payment order of the originator or the beneficiary's bank from releasing funds to the beneficiary or the beneficiary from withdrawing the funds. A court may not otherwise restrain a person from issuing a payment order, paying or receiving payment of a payment order, or otherwise acting with respect to a funds transfer.

#### Section 47-4A504. Order in which items and payment orders may be charged to account; order of withdrawals from account

A. If a receiving bank has received more than one payment order of the sender or one or more payment orders and other items that are payable from the sender's account, the bank may charge the sender's account with respect to the various orders and items in any sequence.

B. In determining whether a credit to an account has been withdrawn by the holder of the account or applied to a debt of the holder of the account, credits first made to the account are first withdrawn or applied.

#### Section 47-4A505. Preclusion of objection to debit of customer's account

If a receiving bank has received payment from its customer with respect to a payment order issued in the name of the customer as sender and accepted by the bank and the customer received notification reasonably identifying the order, the customer is precluded from asserting that the bank is not entitled to retain the payment unless the customer notifies the bank of the customer's objection to the payment within one year after the notification was received by the customer.

#### Section 47-4A506. Rate of interest

A. If, under this chapter, a receiving bank is obliged to pay interest with respect to a payment order issued to the bank, the amount payable may be determined:

1. By agreement of the sender and receiving bank; or

2. By a funds-transfer system rule if the payment order is transmitted through a funds-transfer system.

B. If the amount of interest is not determined by an agreement or rule as stated in subsection A, the amount is calculated by multiplying the applicable federal funds rate by the amount on which interest is payable, and then multiplying the product by the number of days for which interest is payable. The applicable federal funds rate is the average of the federal funds rates published by the federal reserve bank of New York for each of the days for which interest is payable divided by three hundred sixty. The federal funds rate for any day on which a published rate is not available is the same as the published rate for the next preceding day for which there is a published rate. If a receiving bank that accepted a payment order is required to refund payment to the sender of the order because the funds transfer was not completed, but the failure to complete was not due to any fault by the bank, the interest payable is reduced by a percentage equal to the reserve requirement on deposits of the receiving bank.

#### Section 47-4A507. Choice of law

A. The following rules apply unless the affected parties otherwise agree or subsection C applies:

1. The rights and obligations between the sender of a payment order and the receiving bank are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the receiving bank is located.

2. The rights and obligations between the beneficiary's bank and the beneficiary are governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.

3. The issue of when payment is made pursuant to a funds transfer by the originator to the beneficiary is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the beneficiary's bank is located.

B. If the parties described in each paragraph of subsection A have made an agreement selecting the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern rights and obligations between each other, the law of that jurisdiction governs those rights and obligations, whether or not the payment order or the funds transfer bears a reasonable relation to that jurisdiction.

C. A funds-transfer system rule may select the law of a particular jurisdiction to govern rights and obligations between participating banks with respect to payment orders transmitted or processed through the system or the rights and obligations of some or all parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out by means of the system. A choice of law made to govern rights and obligations between participating banks with respect to payment orders transmitted or processed through the system is binding on participating banks. A choice of law made to govern the rights and obligations of some or all parties to a funds transfer any part of which is carried out by means of the system is binding on the originator, other sender, or a receiving bank having notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system when the originator, other sender or receiving bank issued or accepted a payment order. The beneficiary of a funds transfer is bound by the choice of law if, when the funds transfer is initiated, the beneficiary has notice that the funds-transfer system might be used in the funds transfer and of the choice of law by the system. The law of a jurisdiction selected pursuant to this subsection may govern, whether or not that law bears a reasonable relation to the matter in issue.

D. In the event of inconsistency between an agreement under subsection B and a choice-of-law rule under subsection C, the agreement under subsection B prevails.

E. If a funds transfer is made by use of more than one funds-transfer system and there is inconsistency between choice-of-law rules of the systems, the matter in issue is governed by the law of the selected jurisdiction that has the most significant relationship to the matter in issue.

2. "Value". Sections 47-3303 and 47-4211.

C. In addition, chapter 1 of this title contains certain additional general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this chapter.

#### Section 47-5103. Scope

A. This chapter applies to letters of credit and to certain rights and obligations arising out of transactions involving letters of credit.

B. The statement of a rule in this chapter does not by itself require, imply or negate application of the same or a different rule to a situation not provided for, or to a person not specified, in this chapter.

C. With the exception of this subsection, subsections A and D of this section, section 47-5102, subsection A, paragraphs 9 and 10, section 47-5106, subsection D and section 47-5114, subsection D, and except to the extent prohibited in section 47-1302 and section 47-5117, subsection D, the effect of this article may be varied by agreement or by a provision stated or incorporated by reference in an undertaking. A term in an agreement or undertaking generally excusing liability or generally limiting remedies for failure to perform obligations is not sufficient to vary obligations prescribed by this chapter.

D. Rights and obligations of an issuer to a beneficiary or a nominated person under a letter of credit are independent of the existence, performance or nonperformance of a contract or arrangement out of which the letter of credit arises or which underlies it, including contracts or arrangements between the issuer and the applicant and between the applicant and the beneficiary.

 

#### Section 47-5104. Formal requirements

A letter of credit, confirmation, advice, transfer, amendment or cancellation may be issued in any form that is a record and is authenticated by a signature or in accordance with the agreement of the parties or the standard practice referred to in section 47-5108, subsection E.

#### Section 47-5105. Consideration

Consideration is not required to issue, amend, transfer or cancel a letter of credit, advice or confirmation.

#### Section 47-5106. Issuance; amendment; cancellation; duration

A. A letter of credit is issued and becomes enforceable according to its terms against the issuer when the issuer sends or otherwise transmits it to the person requested to advise or to the beneficiary. A letter of credit is revocable only if it so provides.

B. After a letter of credit is issued, rights and obligations of a beneficiary, applicant, confirmer and issuer are not affected by an amendment or cancellation to which that person has not consented except to the extent the letter of credit provides that it is revocable or that the issuer may amend or cancel the letter of credit without that consent.

C. If there is no stated expiration date or other provision that determines its duration, a letter of credit expires one year after its stated date of issuance or, if none is stated, after the date on which it is issued.

D. A letter of credit that states that it is perpetual expires five years after its stated date of issuance, or if none is stated, after the date on which it is issued.

#### Section 47-5107. Confirmer; nominated person

A. A confirmer is directly obligated on a letter of credit and has the rights and obligations of an issuer to the extent of its confirmation. The confirmer also has rights against and obligations to the issuer as if the issuer were an applicant and the confirmer had issued the letter of credit at the request and for the account of the issuer.

B. A nominated person who is not a confirmer is not obligated to honor or otherwise give value for a presentation.

C. A person requested to advise may decline to act as an adviser. An adviser that is not a confirmer is not obligated to honor or give value for a presentation. An adviser undertakes to the issuer and to the beneficiary to accurately advise the terms of the letter of credit, confirmation, amendment or advice received by that person and undertakes to the beneficiary to check the apparent authenticity of the request to advise. Even if the advice is inaccurate, the letter of credit, confirmation or amendment is enforceable as issued.

D. A person who notifies a transferee beneficiary of the terms of a letter of credit, confirmation, amendment or advice has the rights and obligations of an adviser under subsection C. The terms in the notice to the transferee beneficiary may differ from the terms in any notice to the transferor beneficiary to the extent permitted by the letter of credit, confirmation, amendment or advice received by the person who so notifies.

#### Section 47-5108. Issuer's rights and obligations

A. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-5109, an issuer shall honor a presentation that, as determined by the standard practice referred to in subsection E of this section, appears on its face strictly to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-5113 and unless otherwise agreed with the applicant, an issuer shall dishonor a presentation that does not appear to comply.

B. An issuer has a reasonable time after presentation, but not beyond the end of the seventh business day of the issuer after the day of its receipt of documents:

1. To honor;

2. If the letter of credit provides for honor to be completed more than seven business days after presentation, to accept a draft or incur a deferred obligation; or

3. To give notice to the presenter of discrepancies in the presentation.

C. Except as otherwise provided in subsection D of this section, an issuer is precluded from asserting as a basis for dishonor any discrepancy if timely notice is not given, or any discrepancy not stated in the notice if timely notice is given.

D. Failure to give the notice specified in subsection B of this section or to mention fraud, forgery or expiration in the notice does not preclude the issuer from asserting as a basis for dishonor fraud or forgery as described in section 47-5109, subsection A or expiration of the letter of credit before presentation.

E. An issuer shall observe standard practice of financial institutions that regularly issue letters of credit. Determination of the issuer's observance of the standard practice is a matter of interpretation for the court. The court shall offer the parties a reasonable opportunity to present evidence of the standard practice.

F. An issuer is not responsible for:

1. The performance or nonperformance of the underlying contract, arrangement or transaction;

2. An act or omission of others; or

3. Observance or knowledge of the usage of a particular trade other than the standard practice referred to in subsection E of this section.

G. If an undertaking constituting a letter of credit contains nondocumentary conditions, an issuer shall disregard the nondocumentary conditions and treat them as if they were not stated.

H. An issuer that has dishonored a presentation shall return the documents or hold them at the disposal of, and send advice to that effect to, the presenter.

I. An issuer that has honored a presentation as permitted or required by this chapter:

1. Is entitled to be reimbursed by the applicant in immediately available funds not later than the date of its payment of funds;

2. Takes the documents free of claims of the beneficiary or presenter;

3. Is precluded from asserting a right of recourse on a draft under sections 47-3414 and 47-3415;

4. Except as otherwise provided in sections 47-5110 and 47-5117, is precluded from restitution of money paid or other value given by mistake to the extent the mistake concerns discrepancies in the documents or tender that are apparent on the face of the presentation; and

5. Is discharged to the extent of its performance under the letter of credit unless the issuer honored a presentation in which a required signature of a beneficiary was forged.

#### Section 47-5109. Fraud and forgery

A. If a presentation is made that appears on its face strictly to comply with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit, but a required document is forged or materially fraudulent, or honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant:

1. The issuer shall honor the presentation, if honor is demanded by a nominated person who has given value in good faith and without notice of forgery or material fraud, a confirmer who has honored its confirmation in good faith, a holder in due course of a draft drawn under the letter of credit that was taken after acceptance by the issuer or nominated person, or an assignee of the issuer's or nominated person's deferred obligation that was taken for value and without notice of forgery or material fraud after the obligation was incurred by the issuer or nominated person; and

2. The issuer, acting in good faith, may honor or dishonor the presentation in any other case.

B. If an applicant claims that a required document is forged or materially fraudulent or that honor of the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the issuer or applicant, a court of competent jurisdiction may temporarily or permanently enjoin the issuer from honoring a presentation or grant similar relief against the issuer or other persons only if the court finds that:

1. The relief is not prohibited under the law applicable to an accepted draft or deferred obligation incurred by the issuer;

2. A beneficiary, issuer or nominated person who may be adversely affected is adequately protected against loss that it may suffer because the relief is granted;

3. All of the conditions to entitle a person to the relief under the law of this state have been met; and

4. On the basis of the information submitted to the court, the applicant is more likely than not to succeed under its claim of forgery or material fraud and the person demanding honor does not qualify for protection under subsection A, paragraph 1.

#### Section 47-5110. Warranties

A. If its presentation is honored, the beneficiary warrants:

1. To the issuer, any other person to whom presentation is made and the applicant that there is no fraud or forgery of the kind described in section 47-5109, subsection A; and

2. To the applicant that the drawing does not violate any agreement between the applicant and beneficiary or any other agreement intended by them to be augmented by the letter of credit.

B. The warranties in subsection A of this section are in addition to warranties arising under chapters 3, 4, 7 and 8 of this title because of the presentation or transfer of documents covered by any of those chapters.

#### Section 47-5111. Remedies

A. If an issuer wrongfully dishonors or repudiates its obligation to pay money under a letter of credit before presentation, the beneficiary, successor or nominated person presenting on its own behalf may recover from the issuer the amount that is the subject of the dishonor or repudiation. If the issuer's obligation under the letter of credit is not for the payment of money, the claimant may obtain specific performance or, at the claimant's election, may recover an amount equal to the value of performance from the issuer. In either case, the claimant may also recover incidental but not consequential damages. The claimant is not obligated to take action to avoid damages that might be due from the issuer under this subsection. If, although not obligated to do so, the claimant avoids damages, the claimant's recovery from the issuer must be reduced by the amount of damages avoided. The issuer has the burden of proving the amount of damages avoided. In the case of repudiation the claimant need not present any document.

B. If an issuer wrongfully dishonors a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit or honors a draft or demand in breach of its obligation to the applicant, the applicant may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, minus any amount saved as a result of the breach.

C. If an adviser or nominated person other than a confirmer breaches an obligation under this chapter or an issuer breaches an obligation not covered in subsection A or B, a person to whom the obligation is owed may recover damages resulting from the breach, including incidental but not consequential damages, minus any amount saved as a result of the breach. To the extent of the confirmation, a confirmer has the liability of an issuer specified in this subsection and subsections A and B.

D. An issuer, nominated person or adviser who is found liable under subsection A, B or C shall pay interest on the amount owed thereunder from the date of wrongful dishonor or other appropriate date.

E. Reasonable attorney fees and other expenses of litigation must be awarded to the prevailing party in an action in which a remedy is sought under this chapter.

F. Damages that would otherwise be payable by a party for breach of an obligation under this chapter may be liquidated by agreement or undertaking, but only in an amount or by a formula that is reasonable in light of the harm anticipated.

#### Section 47-5112. Transfer of letter of credit

A. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-5113, unless a letter of credit provides that it is transferable, the right of a beneficiary to draw or otherwise demand performance under a letter of credit may not be transferred.

B. Even if a letter of credit provides that it is transferable, the issuer may refuse to recognize or carry out a transfer if:

1. The transfer would violate applicable law; or

2. The transferor or transferee has failed to comply with any requirement stated in the letter of credit or any other requirement relating to transfer imposed by the issuer that is within the standard practice referred to in section 47-5108, subsection E or that is otherwise reasonable under the circumstances.

#### Section 47-5113. Transfer by operation of law

A. A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents and receive payment or other items of value in the name of the beneficiary without disclosing its status as a successor.

B. A successor of a beneficiary may consent to amendments, sign and present documents and receive payment or other items of value in its own name as the disclosed successor of the beneficiary. Except as otherwise provided in subsection E of this section, an issuer shall recognize a disclosed successor of a beneficiary as beneficiary in full substitution for its predecessor upon compliance with the requirements for recognition by the issuer of a transfer of drawing rights by operation of law under the standard practice referred to in section 47-5108, subsection E or, in the absence of such a practice, compliance with other reasonable procedures sufficient to protect the issuer.

C. An issuer is not obliged to determine whether a purported successor is a successor of a beneficiary or whether the signature of a purported successor is genuine or authorized.

D. Honor of a purported successor's apparently complying presentation under subsection A or B of this section has the consequences specified in section 47-5108, subsection I even if the purported successor is not the successor of a beneficiary. Documents signed in the name of the beneficiary or of a disclosed successor by a person who is neither the beneficiary nor the successor of the beneficiary are forged documents for the purposes of section 47-5109.

E. An issuer whose rights of reimbursement are not covered by subsection D of this section or substantially similar law and any confirmer or nominated person may decline to recognize a presentation under subsection B of this section.

F. A beneficiary whose name is changed after the issuance of a letter of credit has the same rights and obligations as a successor of a beneficiary under this section.

#### Section 47-5114. Assignment of proceeds

A. In this section, "proceeds of a letter of credit" means the cash, check, accepted draft or other item of value paid or delivered upon honor or giving of value by the issuer or any nominated person under the letter of credit. The term does not include a beneficiary's drawing rights or documents presented by the beneficiary.

B. A beneficiary may assign its right to part or all of the proceeds of a letter of credit. The beneficiary may do so before presentation as a present assignment of its right to receive proceeds contingent upon its compliance with the terms and conditions of the letter of credit.

C. An issuer or nominated person need not recognize an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit until it consents to the assignment.

D. An issuer or nominated person has no obligation to give or withhold its consent to an assignment of proceeds of a letter of credit, but consent may not be unreasonably withheld if the assignee possesses and exhibits the letter of credit and presentation of the letter of credit is a condition to honor.

E. Rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person are independent of the beneficiary's assignment of the proceeds of a letter of credit and are superior to the assignee's right to the proceeds.

F. Neither the rights recognized by this section between an assignee and an issuer, transferee beneficiary or nominated person nor the issuer's or nominated person's payment of proceeds to an assignee or a third person affects the rights between the assignee and any person other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary or nominated person.  The mode of creating and perfecting a security interest in or granting an assignment of a beneficiary's rights to proceeds is governed by chapter 9 of this title or other law. Against persons other than the issuer, transferee beneficiary or nominated person, the rights and obligations arising upon the creation of a security interest or other assignment of a beneficiary's right to proceeds and its perfection are governed by chapter 9 of this title or other law.

#### Section 47-5115. Statute of limitations

An action to enforce a right or obligation arising under this article must be commenced within one year after the expiration date of the relevant letter of credit or one year after the cause of action accrues, whichever occurs later. A cause of action accrues when the breach occurs, regardless of the aggrieved party's lack of knowledge of the breach.

#### Section 47-5116. Choice of law and forum

A. The liability of an issuer, nominated person or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction chosen by an agreement in the form of a record signed or otherwise authenticated by the affected parties in the manner provided in section 47-5104 or by a provision in the person's letter of credit, confirmation or other undertaking. The jurisdiction whose law is chosen need not bear any relation to the transaction.

B. Unless subsection A of this section applies, the liability of an issuer, nominated person or adviser for action or omission is governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the person is located. The person is considered to be located at the address indicated in the person's undertaking. If more than one address is indicated, the person is considered to be located at the address from which the person's undertaking was issued. For the purpose of jurisdiction, choice of law and recognition of interbranch letters of credit, but not enforcement of a judgment, all branches of a bank are considered separate juridical entities and a bank is considered to be located at the place where its relevant branch is considered to be located under this subsection.

C. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the liability of an issuer, nominated person or adviser is governed by any rules of custom or practice, such as the uniform customs and practice for documentary credits, to which the letter of credit, confirmation or other undertaking is expressly made subject. If this chapter would govern the liability of an issuer, nominated person or adviser under subsection A or B of this section, the relevant undertaking incorporates rules of custom or practice, and there is conflict between this article and those rules as applied to that undertaking, those rules govern except to the extent of any conflict with the nonvariable provisions specified in section 47-5103, subsection C.

D. If there is conflict between this chapter and chapter 3, 4, 4A or 9 of this title, this chapter governs.

E. The forum for settling disputes arising out of an undertaking within this article may be chosen in the manner and with the binding effect that governing law may be chosen in accordance with subsection A of this section.

#### Section 47-5117. Subrogation of issuer, applicant and nominated person

A. An issuer that honors a beneficiary's presentation is subrogated to the rights of the beneficiary to the same extent as if the issuer were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary and of the applicant to the same extent as if the issuer were the secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant.

B. An applicant that reimburses an issuer is subrogated to the rights of the issuer against any beneficiary, presenter or nominated person to the same extent as if the applicant were the secondary obligor of the obligations owed to the issuer and has the rights of subrogation of the issuer to the rights of the beneficiary stated in subsection A.

C. A nominated person who pays or gives value against a draft or demand presented under a letter of credit is subrogated to the rights of:

1. The issuer against the applicant to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the obligation owed to the issuer by the applicant;

2. The beneficiary to the same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the beneficiary; and

3. The applicant to same extent as if the nominated person were a secondary obligor of the underlying obligation owed to the applicant.

D. Notwithstanding any agreement or term to the contrary, the rights of subrogation stated in subsections A and B do not arise until the issuer honors the letter of credit or otherwise pays and the rights in subsection C do not arise until the nominated person pays or otherwise gives value. Until then, the issuer, nominated person and applicant do not derive under this section present or prospective rights forming the basis of a claim, defense or excuse.

#### Section 47-5118. Security interest of issuer or nominated person

A. An issuer or nominated person has a security interest in a document presented under a letter of credit to the extent that the issuer or nominated person honors or gives value for the presentation.

B. As long as and to the extent that an issuer or nominated person has not been reimbursed or has not otherwise recovered the value given with respect to a security interest in a document under subsection A of this section, the security interest continues and is subject to chapter 9 of this title, but:

1. A security agreement is not necessary to make the security interest enforceable under section 47-9203, subsection B, paragraph 3;

2. If the document is presented in a medium other than a written or other tangible medium, the security interest is perfected; and

3. If the document is presented in a written or other tangible medium and is not a certificated security, chattel paper, a document of title, an instrument or a letter of credit, the security interest is perfected and has priority over conflicting security interest in the document as long as the debtor does not have possession of the document.

### Article 2 - Warehouse Receipts: Special Provisions

#### Section 47-7201. Person that may issue a warehouse receipt; storage under bond

A. A warehouse receipt may be issued by any warehouse.

B. If goods, including distilled spirits and agricultural commodities, are stored under a statute requiring a bond against withdrawal or a license for the issuance of receipts in the nature of warehouse receipts, a receipt issued for the goods is deemed to be a warehouse receipt even if issued by a person that is the owner of the goods and that is not a warehouse.

 

#### Section 47-7202. Form of warehouse receipt; effect of omission

A. A warehouse receipt need not be in any particular form.

B. Unless a warehouse receipt provides for each of the following, the warehouse is liable for damages caused to a person injured by its omission:

1. A statement of the location of the warehouse facility where the goods are stored;

2. The date of issue of the receipt;

3. The unique identification code of the receipt;

4. A statement whether the goods received will be delivered to the bearer, to a named person or to a named person or its order;

5. The rate of storage and handling charges, unless goods are stored under a field warehousing arrangement, in which case a statement of that fact is sufficient on a nonnegotiable receipt;

6. A description of the goods or the packages containing them;

7. The signature of the warehouse or its agent;

8. If the receipt is issued for goods that the warehouse owns, either solely, jointly or in common with others, a statement of the fact of that ownership; and

9. A statement of the amount of advances made and of liabilities incurred for which the warehouse claims a lien or security interest, unless the precise amount of advances made or liabilities incurred, at the time of the issue of the receipt, is unknown to the warehouse or to its agent that issued the receipt, in which case a statement of the fact that advances have been made or liabilities incurred and the purpose of the advances or liabilities is sufficient.

C. A warehouse may insert in its receipt any terms that are not contrary to this title and that do not impair its obligation of delivery under section 47-7403 or its duty of care under section 47-7204. Any contrary provision is ineffective.

 

#### Section 47-7203. Liability for nonreceipt or misdescription

A party to or purchaser for value in good faith of a document of title, other than a bill of lading, that relies on the description of the goods in the document may recover from the issuer damages caused by the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that:

1. The document conspicuously indicates that the issuer does not know whether all or part of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as a case in which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity or condition or the receipt or description is qualified by "contents, condition and quality unknown", "said to contain" or words of similar import, if the indication is true; or

2. The party or purchaser otherwise has notice of the nonreceipt or misdescription.

 

#### Section 47-7204. Duty of care; contractual limitation of warehouse's liability

A. A warehouse is liable for damages for loss of or injury to the goods caused by its failure to exercise care with regard to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar circumstances.  Unless otherwise agreed, the warehouse is not liable for damages that could not have been avoided by the exercise of that care.

B. Damages may be limited by a term in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement limiting the amount of liability in case of loss or damage beyond which the warehouse is not liable.  Such a limitation is not effective with respect to the warehouse's liability for conversion to its own use.  On request of the bailor in a record at the time of signing the storage agreement or within a reasonable time after receipt of the warehouse receipt, the warehouse's liability may be increased on part or all of the goods covered by the storage agreement or the warehouse receipt.  In this event, increased rates may be charged based on an increased valuation of the goods.

C. Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based on the bailment may be included in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement.

D. This section does not modify or repeal any statute that imposes a higher responsibility on the warehouse or invalidates a contractual limitation that would be permissible under this chapter.

 

#### Section 47-7205. Title under warehouse receipt defeated in certain cases

A buyer in ordinary course of business of fungible goods sold and delivered by a warehouse that is also in the business of buying and selling such goods takes the goods free of any claim under a warehouse receipt even if the receipt is negotiable and has been duly negotiated.

 

#### Section 47-7206. Termination of storage at warehouse's option

A. A warehouse, by giving notice to the person on whose account the goods are held and any other person known to claim an interest in the goods, may require payment of any charges and removal of the goods from the warehouse at the termination of the period of storage fixed by the document of title or, if a period is not fixed, within a stated period not less than thirty days after the warehouse gives notice.  If the goods are not removed before the date specified in the notice, the warehouse may sell them pursuant to section 47-7210.

B. If a warehouse in good faith believes that goods are about to deteriorate or decline in value to less than the amount of its lien within the time provided in subsection A of this section and section 47-7210, the warehouse may specify in the notice given under subsection A of this section any reasonable shorter time for removal of the goods and, if the goods are not removed, may sell them at public sale held not less than one week after a single advertisement or posting.

C. If, as a result of a quality or condition of the goods of which the warehouse did not have notice at the time of deposit, the goods are a hazard to other property, the warehouse facilities or other persons, the warehouse may sell the goods at public or private sale without advertisement or posting on reasonable notification to all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  If the warehouse, after a reasonable effort, is unable to sell the goods, it may dispose of them in any lawful manner and does not incur liability by reason of that disposition.

D. A warehouse shall deliver the goods to any person entitled to them under this chapter on due demand made at any time before sale or other disposition under this section.

E. A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale or disposition under this section but shall hold the balance for delivery on the demand of any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.

 

#### Section 47-7207. Goods must be kept separate; fungible

A. Unless the warehouse receipt provides otherwise, a warehouse shall keep separate the goods covered by each receipt so as to permit at all times identification and delivery of those goods.  However, different lots of fungible goods may be commingled.

B. If different lots of fungible goods are commingled, the goods are owned in common by the persons entitled thereto and the warehouse is severally liable to each owner for that owner's share.  If, because of overissue, a mass of fungible goods is insufficient to meet all the receipts the warehouse has issued against it, the persons entitled include all holders to which overissued receipts have been duly negotiated.

 

#### Section 47-7208. Altered warehouse receipts

If a blank in a negotiable tangible warehouse receipt has been filled in without authority, a good faith purchaser for value and without notice of the lack of authority may treat the insertion as authorized.  Any other unauthorized alteration leaves any tangible or electronic warehouse receipt enforceable against the issuer according to its original tenor.

 

#### Section 47-7209. Lien of warehouse

A. A warehouse has a lien against the bailor on the goods covered by a warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, insurance, labor or other charges, present or future, in relation to the goods and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.  If the person on whose account the goods are held is liable for similar charges or expenses in relation to other goods whenever deposited and it is stated in the warehouse receipt or storage agreement that a lien is claimed for charges and expenses in relation to other goods, the warehouse also has a lien against the goods covered by the warehouse receipt or storage agreement or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for those charges and expenses whether or not the other goods have been delivered by the warehouse.  However, as against a person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt is duly negotiated, a warehouse’s lien is limited to charges in an amount or at a rate specified in the warehouse receipt or, if no charges are so specified, to a reasonable charge for storage of the specific goods covered by the receipt subsequent to the date of the receipt.

B. A warehouse may also reserve a security interest against the bailor for the maximum amount specified on the receipt for charges other than those specified in subsection A of this section, such as for money advanced and interest.  The security interest is governed by chapter 9 of this title.

C. A warehouse’s lien for charges and expenses under subsection A of this section or a security interest under subsection B of this section is also effective against any person that so entrusted the bailor with possession of the goods that a pledge of them by the bailor to a good faith purchaser for value would have been valid.  However, the lien or security interest is not effective against a person that before issuance of a document of title had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:

1. Deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor’s nominee with:

(a) Actual or apparent authority to ship, store, or sell;

(b) Power to obtain delivery under section 47-7403; or

(c) Power of disposition under section 47-2403, section 47-2A304, subsection B, section 47-2A305, subsection B, section 47-9320 or section 47-9321, subsection C or other statute or rule of law; or

2. Acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.

D. A warehouse’s lien on household goods for charges and expenses in relation to the goods under subsection A of this section is also effective against all persons if the depositor was the legal possessor of the goods at the time of deposit.  For the purposes of this subsection, "household goods" means furniture, furnishings or personal effects used by the depositor in a dwelling.

E. A warehouse loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.

 

#### Section 47-7210. Enforcement of warehouse's liens

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection B, a warehouse's lien may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale and the time and place of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the warehouse is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The warehouse sells in a commercially reasonable manner if the warehouse sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefore, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.  A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.

B. A warehouse may enforce its lien on goods, other than goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, only if the following requirements are satisfied:

1. All persons known to claim an interest in the goods have been notified.

2. The notification includes an itemized statement of the claim, a description of the goods subject to the lien, a demand for payment within a specified time not less than ten days after receipt of the notification and a conspicuous statement that unless the claim is paid within that time the goods will be advertised for sale and sold by auction at a specified time and place.

3. The sale conforms to the terms of the notification.

4. The sale is held at the nearest suitable place to where the goods are held or stored.

5. After the expiration of the time given in the notification, an advertisement of the sale is published once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held. The advertisement must include a description of the goods, the name of the person on whose account the goods are being held and the time and place of the sale. The sale must take place at least fifteen days after the first publication.  If there is no newspaper of general circulation where the sale is to be held, the advertisement must be posted at least ten days before the sale in not fewer than six conspicuous places in the neighborhood of the proposed sale.

C. Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by the warehouse subject to the terms of the receipt and this chapter.

D. A warehouse may buy at any public sale held pursuant to this section.

E. A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a warehouse's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid despite the warehouse's noncompliance with this section.

F. A warehouse may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the warehouse would have been bound to deliver the goods.

G. The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.

H. If a lien is on goods stored by a merchant in the course of its business, the lien may be enforced in accordance with subsection A or B.

I. A warehouse is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of wilful violation, is liable for conversion.

 

### Article 3 - Bills of Lading: Special Provisions

#### Section 47-7301. Liability for nonreceipt or misdescription; "said to contain"; "shipper's weight, load and count"; improper handling

A. A consignee of a nonnegotiable bill of lading that has given value in good faith, or a holder to which a negotiable bill has been duly negotiated, relying on the description of the goods in the bill or on the date shown in the bill, may recover from the issuer damages caused by the misdating of the bill or the nonreceipt or misdescription of the goods, except to the extent that the bill indicates that the issuer does not know whether any part or all of the goods in fact were received or conform to the description, such as in a case in which the description is in terms of marks or labels or kind, quantity or condition or the receipt or description is qualified by "contents or condition of contents of packages unknown", "said to contain", "shipper's weight, load and count" or words of similar import, if that indication is true.

B. If goods are loaded by the issuer of a bill of lading:

1. The issuer shall count the packages of goods if shipped in packages and ascertain the kind and quantity if shipped in bulk; and

2. Words such as "shipper's weight, load and count" or words of similar import indicating that the description was made by the shipper are ineffective except as to goods concealed in packages.

C. If bulk goods are loaded by a shipper that makes available to the issuer of a bill of lading adequate facilities for weighing those goods, the issuer shall ascertain the kind and quantity within a reasonable time after receiving the shipper’s request in a record to do so.  In that case, "shipper's weight" or words of similar import are ineffective.

D. The issuer of a bill of lading, by including in the bill the words "shipper's weight, load and count" or words of similar import, may indicate that the goods were loaded by the shipper, and, if that statement is true, the issuer is not liable for damages caused by the improper loading. However, omission of such words does not imply liability for damages caused by improper loading.

E. A shipper guarantees to an issuer the accuracy at the time of shipment of the description, marks, labels, number, kind, quantity, condition and weight, as furnished by the shipper, and the shipper shall indemnify the issuer against damage caused by inaccuracies in those particulars.  This right of indemnity does not limit the issuer’s responsibility or liability under the contract of carriage to any person other than the shipper.

 

#### Section 47-7302. Through bills of lading and similar documents of title

A. The issuer of a through bill of lading, or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by a person acting as its agent or by a performing carrier, is liable to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for any breach by the other person or the performing carrier of its obligation under the bill or other document. However, to the extent that the bill or other document covers an undertaking to be performed overseas or in territory not contiguous to the continental United States or an undertaking including matters other than transportation, this liability for breach by the other person or the performing carrier may be varied by agreement of the parties.

B. If goods covered by a through bill of lading or other document of title embodying an undertaking to be performed in part by a person other than the issuer are received by that person, the person is subject, with respect to its own performance while the goods are in its possession, to the obligation of the issuer.  The person’s obligation is discharged by delivery of the goods to another person pursuant to the bill or other document and does not include liability for breach by any other person or by the issuer.

C. The issuer of a through bill of lading or other document of title described in subsection A is entitled to recover from the performing carrier or other person in possession of the goods when the breach of the obligation under the bill or other document occurred:

1. The amount it may be required to pay to any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for the breach, as may be evidenced by any receipt, judgment or transcript of judgment; and

2. The amount of any expense reasonably incurred by the issuer in defending any action commenced by any person entitled to recover on the bill or other document for the breach.

 

#### Section 47-7303. Diversion; reconsignment; change of instructions

A. Unless the bill of lading otherwise provides, a carrier may deliver the goods to a person or destination other than that stated in the bill or may otherwise dispose of the goods, without liability for misdelivery, on instructions from:

1. The holder of a negotiable bill;

2. The consignor on a nonnegotiable bill, even if the consignee has given contrary instructions;

3. The consignee on a nonnegotiable bill in the absence of contrary instructions from the consignor, if the goods have arrived at the billed destination or if the consignee is in possession of the tangible bill or in control of the electronic bill; or

4. The consignee on a nonnegotiable bill, if the consignee is entitled as against the consignor to dispose of the goods.

B. Unless instructions described in subsection A are included in a negotiable bill of lading, a person to which the bill is duly negotiated may hold the bailee according to the original terms.

 

#### Section 47-7304. Tangible bills of lading in a set

A. Except as customary in international transportation, a tangible bill of lading may not be issued in a set of parts. The issuer is liable for damages caused by violation of this subsection.

B. If a tangible bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts, each of which contains an identification code and is expressed to be valid only if the goods have not been delivered against any other part, the whole of the parts constitutes one bill.

C. If a tangible negotiable bill of lading is lawfully issued in a set of parts and different parts are negotiated to different persons, the title of the holder to which the first due negotiation is made prevails as to both the document of title and the goods even if any later holder may have received the goods from the carrier in good faith and discharged the carrier's obligation by surrendering its part.

D. A person that negotiates or transfers a single part of a tangible bill of lading issued in a set is liable to holders of that part as if it were the whole set.

E. The bailee shall deliver in accordance with article 4 of this chapter against the first presented part of a tangible bill of lading lawfully issued in a set.  Delivery in this manner discharges the bailee's obligation on the whole bill.

 

#### Section 47-7305. Destination bills

A. Instead of issuing a bill of lading to the consignor at the place of shipment, a carrier, at the request of the consignor, may procure the bill to be issued at destination or at any other place designated in the request.

B. On request of any person entitled as against a carrier to control the goods while in transit and on surrender of possession or control of any outstanding bill of lading or other receipt covering the goods, the issuer, subject to section 47-7105, may procure a substitute bill to be issued at any place designated in the request.

 

#### Section 47-7306. Altered bills of lading

An unauthorized alteration or filling in of a blank in a bill of lading leaves the bill enforceable according to its original tenor.

 

#### Section 47-7307. Lien of carrier

A. A carrier has a lien on the goods covered by a bill of lading or on the proceeds thereof in its possession for charges after the date of the carrier’s receipt of the goods for storage or transportation, including demurrage and terminal charges, and for expenses necessary for preservation of the goods incident to their transportation or reasonably incurred in their sale pursuant to law.  However, against a purchaser for value of a negotiable bill of lading, a carrier's lien is limited to charges stated in the bill or the applicable tariffs or, if no charges are stated, a reasonable charge.

B. A lien for charges and expenses under subsection A on goods that the carrier was required by law to receive for transportation is effective against the consignor or any person entitled to the goods unless the carrier had notice that the consignor lacked authority to subject the goods to those charges and expenses.  Any other lien under subsection A is effective against the consignor and any person that permitted the bailor to have control or possession of the goods unless the carrier had notice that the bailor lacked authority.

C. A carrier loses its lien on any goods that it voluntarily delivers or unjustifiably refuses to deliver.

 

#### Section 47-7308. Enforcement of carrier's lien

A. A carrier's lien on goods may be enforced by public or private sale of the goods, in bulk or in packages, at any time or place and on any terms that are commercially reasonable, after notifying all persons known to claim an interest in the goods.  The notification must include a statement of the amount due, the nature of the proposed sale and the time and place of any public sale.  The fact that a better price could have been obtained by a sale at a different time or in a method different from that selected by the carrier is not of itself sufficient to establish that the sale was not made in a commercially reasonable manner.  The carrier sells goods in a commercially reasonable manner if the carrier sells the goods in the usual manner in any recognized market therefor, sells at the price current in that market at the time of the sale or otherwise sells in conformity with commercially reasonable practices among dealers in the type of goods sold.  A sale of more goods than apparently necessary to be offered to ensure satisfaction of the obligation is not commercially reasonable, except in cases covered by the preceding sentence.

B. Before any sale pursuant to this section, any person claiming a right in the goods may pay the amount necessary to satisfy the lien and the reasonable expenses incurred in complying with this section. In that event, the goods may not be sold but must be retained by the carrier, subject to the terms of the bill of lading and this chapter.

C. A carrier may buy at any public sale pursuant to this section.

D. A purchaser in good faith of goods sold to enforce a carrier's lien takes the goods free of any rights of persons against which the lien was valid, despite the carrier’s noncompliance with this section.

E. A carrier may satisfy its lien from the proceeds of any sale pursuant to this section but shall hold the balance, if any, for delivery on demand to any person to which the carrier would have been bound to deliver the goods.

F. The rights provided by this section are in addition to all other rights allowed by law to a creditor against a debtor.

G. A carrier's lien may be enforced pursuant to either subsection A of this section or the procedure set forth in Section 47-7210, subsection B.

H. A carrier is liable for damages caused by failure to comply with the requirements for sale under this section and, in case of wilful violation, is liable for conversion.

 

#### Section 47-7309. Duty of care; contractual limitation of carrier's liability

A. A carrier that issues a bill of lading, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, shall exercise the degree of care in relation to the goods that a reasonably careful person would exercise under similar circumstances. This subsection does not affect any statute, regulation or rule of law that imposes liability on a common carrier for damages not caused by its negligence.

B. Damages may be limited by a term in the bill of lading or in a transportation agreement that the carrier's liability may not exceed a value stated in the bill or transportation agreement if the carrier's rates are dependent on value and the consignor is afforded an opportunity to declare a higher value and the consignor is advised of the opportunity. However, such a limitation is not effective with respect to the carrier's liability for conversion to its own use.

C. Reasonable provisions as to the time and manner of presenting claims and commencing actions based on the shipment may be included in a bill of lading or a transportation agreement.

 

### Article 4 - Warehouse Receipts and Bills of Lading: General Obligations

#### Section 47-7401. Irregularities in issue of receipt or bill or conduct of issuer

The obligations imposed by this chapter on an issuer apply to a document of title even if:

1. The document does not comply with the requirements of this chapter or of any other statute, rule or regulation regarding its issuance, form or content;

2. The issuer violated laws regulating the conduct of its business;

3. The goods covered by the document were owned by the bailee when the document was issued; or

4. The person issuing the document is not a warehouse but the document purports to be a warehouse receipt.

 

#### Section 47-7402. Duplicate document of title; overissue

A duplicate or any other document of title purporting to cover goods already represented by an outstanding document of the same issuer does not confer any right in the goods, except as provided in the case of tangible bills of lading in a set of parts, overissue of documents for fungible goods, substitutes for lost, stolen or destroyed documents or substitute documents issued pursuant to section 47-7105.  The issuer is liable for damages caused by its overissue or failure to identify a duplicate document by a conspicuous notation.

 

#### Section 47-7403. Obligation of bailee to deliver; excuse

A. A bailee shall deliver the goods to a person entitled under a document of title if the person complies with subsections B and C of this section, unless and to the extent that the bailee establishes any of the following:

1. Delivery of the goods to a person whose receipt was rightful as against the claimant;

2. Damage to or delay, loss or destruction of the goods for which the bailee is not liable;

3. Previous sale or other disposition of the goods in lawful enforcement of a lien or on a warehouse's lawful termination of storage;

4. The exercise by a seller of its right to stop delivery pursuant to section 47-2705 or by a lessor of its right to stop delivery pursuant to section 47-2A526;

5. A diversion, reconsignment or other disposition pursuant to section 47-7303;

6. Release, satisfaction or any other personal defense against the claimant; or

7. Any other lawful excuse.

B. A person claiming goods covered by a document of title shall satisfy the bailee's lien if the bailee so requests or if the bailee is prohibited by law from delivering the goods until the charges are paid.

C. Unless a person claiming the goods is a person against which the document of title does not confer a right under section 47-7503, subsection A:

1. The person claiming under a document shall surrender possession or control of any outstanding negotiable document covering the goods for cancellation or indication of partial deliveries; and

2. The bailee shall cancel the document or conspicuously indicate in the document the partial delivery or the bailee is liable to any person to which the document is duly negotiated.

 

#### Section 47-7404. No liability for good faith delivery pursuant to document of title

A bailee that in good faith has received goods and delivered or otherwise disposed of the goods according to the terms of a document of title or pursuant to this chapter is not liable for the goods even if:

1. The person from which the bailee received the goods did not have authority to procure the document or to dispose of the goods; or

2. The person to which the bailee delivered the goods did not have authority to receive the goods.

 

### Article 5 - Warehouse Receipts and Bills of Lading: Negotiation and Transfer

#### Section 47-7501. Form of negotiation and requirements of due negotiation

A. The following rules apply to a negotiable tangible document of title:

1. If the document’s original terms run to the order of a named person, the document is negotiated by the named person’s indorsement and delivery.  After the named person's indorsement in blank or to bearer, any person may negotiate the document by delivery alone.

2. If the document’s original terms run to bearer, it is negotiated by delivery alone.

3. If the document’s original terms run to the order of a named person and it is delivered to the named person, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.

4. Negotiation of the document after it has been indorsed to a named person requires indorsement by the named person and delivery.

5. A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves receiving the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.

B. The following rules apply to a negotiable electronic document of title:

1. If the document's original terms run to the order of a named person or to bearer, the document is negotiated by delivery of the document to another person.  Indorsement by the named person is not required to negotiate the document.

2. If the document’s original terms run to the order of a named person and the named person has control of the document, the effect is the same as if the document had been negotiated.

3. A document is duly negotiated if it is negotiated in the manner stated in this subsection to a holder that purchases it in good faith, without notice of any defense against or claim to it on the part of any person and for value, unless it is established that the negotiation is not in the regular course of business or financing or involves taking delivery of the document in settlement or payment of a monetary obligation.

C. Indorsement of a nonnegotiable document of title neither makes it negotiable nor adds to the transferee's rights.

D. The naming in a negotiable bill of lading of a person to be notified of the arrival of the goods does not limit the negotiability of the bill or constitute notice to a purchaser of the bill of any interest of that person in the goods.

 

#### Section 47-7502. Rights acquired by due negotiation

A. Subject to sections 47-7205 and 47-7503, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated acquires thereby:

1. Title to the document;

2. Title to the goods;

3. All rights accruing under the law of agency or estoppel, including rights to goods delivered to the bailee after the document was issued; and

4. The direct obligation of the issuer to hold or deliver the goods according to the terms of the document free of any defense or claim by the issuer except those arising under the terms of the document or under this chapter, but in the case of a delivery order, the bailee's obligation accrues only upon the bailee’s acceptance of the delivery order and the obligation acquired by the holder is that the issuer and any indorser will procure the acceptance of the bailee.

B. Subject to section 47-7503, title and rights acquired by due negotiation are not defeated by any stoppage of the goods represented by the document of title or by surrender of the goods by the bailee and are not impaired even if:

1. The due negotiation or any prior due negotiation constituted a breach of duty;

2. Any person has been deprived of possession of a negotiable tangible document or control of a negotiable electronic document by misrepresentation, fraud, accident, mistake, duress, loss, theft or conversion; or

3. A previous sale or other transfer of the goods or document has been made to a third person.

 

#### Section 47-7503. Document of title to goods defeated in certain cases

A. A document of title confers no right in goods against a person that before issuance of the document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in the goods and that did not:

1. Deliver or entrust the goods or any document of title covering the goods to the bailor or the bailor's nominee with:

(a) Actual or apparent authority to ship, store or sell;

(b) Power to obtain delivery under section 47-7403; or

(c) Power of disposition under section 47-2403, section 47-2A304, subsection B, section 47-2A305, subsection B, section 47-9320 or section 47-9321, subsection C or another statute or rule of law; or

2. Acquiesce in the procurement by the bailor or its nominee of any document.

B. Title to goods based on an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of any person to which a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated.  That title may be defeated under section 47-7504 to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer.

C. Title to goods based on a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of any person to which a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated.  However, delivery by the carrier in accordance with article 4 of this chapter pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to deliver.

 

#### Section 47-7504. Rights acquired in absence of due negotiation; effect of diversion; stoppage of delivery

A. A transferee of a document of title, whether negotiable or nonnegotiable, to which the document has been delivered but not duly negotiated, acquires the title and rights that its transferor had or had actual authority to convey.

B. In the case of a transfer of a nonnegotiable document of title, until but not after the bailee receives notice of the transfer, the rights of the transferee may be defeated:

1. By those creditors of the transferor that could treat the transfer as void under section 47-2402 or 47-2A308;

2. By a buyer from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the buyer or received notification of the buyer's rights;

3. By a lessee from the transferor in ordinary course of business if the bailee has delivered the goods to the lessee or received notification of the lessee's rights; or

4. As against the bailee, by good faith dealings of the bailee with the transferor.

C. A diversion or other change of shipping instructions by the consignor in a nonnegotiable bill of lading that causes the bailee not to deliver the goods to the consignee defeats the consignee's title to the goods if the goods have been delivered to a buyer in ordinary course of business or a lessee in ordinary course of business and, in any event, defeats the consignee's rights against the bailee.

D. Delivery of the goods pursuant to a nonnegotiable document of title may be stopped by a seller under section 47-2705 or a lessor under section 47-2A526, subject to the requirements of due notification in those sections. A bailee that honors the seller's or lessor's instructions is entitled to be indemnified by the seller or lessor against any resulting loss or expense.

 

#### Section 47-7505. Indorser not guarantor for other parties

The indorsement of a tangible document of title issued by a bailee does not make the indorser liable for any default by the bailee or previous indorsers.

 

#### Section 47-7506. Delivery without indorsement; right to compel indorsement

The transferee of a negotiable tangible document of title has a specifically enforceable right to have its transferor supply any necessary indorsement, but the transfer becomes a negotiation only as of the time the indorsement is supplied.

 

#### Section 47-7507. Warranties on negotiation or delivery of document of title

If a person negotiates or delivers a document of title for value, otherwise than as a mere intermediary under section 47-7508, unless otherwise agreed, the transferor, in addition to any warranty made in selling or leasing the goods, warrants to its immediate purchaser only that:

1. The document is genuine;

2. The transferor does not have knowledge of any fact that would impair the document's validity or worth; and

3. The negotiation or delivery is rightful and fully effective with respect to the title to the document and the goods it represents.

 

#### Section 47-7508. Warranties of collecting bank as to documents of title

A collecting bank or other intermediary known to be entrusted with documents of title on behalf of another or with collection of a draft or other claim against delivery of documents warrants by the delivery of the documents only its own good faith and authority even if the collecting bank or other intermediary has purchased or made advances against the claim or draft to be collected.

 

#### Section 47-7509. Adequate compliance with commercial contract

Whether a document of title is adequate to fulfill the obligations of a contract for sale, a contract for lease or the conditions of a letter of credit is determined by chapter 2, 2A or 5 of this title.

 

### Article 6 - Warehouse Receipts and Bills of Lading: Miscellaneous Provisions

#### Section 47-7601. Lost, stolen or destroyed documents of title

A. If a document of title is lost, stolen or destroyed, a court may order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document and the bailee may without liability to any person comply with the order.  If the document was negotiable, a court may not order delivery of the goods or issuance of a substitute document without the claimant's posting security unless it finds that any person that may suffer loss as a result of nonsurrender of possession or control of the document is adequately protected against the loss.  If the document was nonnegotiable, the court may require security.  The court may also order payment of the bailee's reasonable costs and attorney fees in any action under this subsection.

B. A bailee that, without a court order, delivers goods to a person claiming under a missing negotiable document of title is liable to any person injured thereby.  If the delivery is not in good faith, the bailee is liable for conversion.  Delivery in good faith is not conversion if the claimant posts security with the bailee in an amount at least double the value of the goods at the time of posting to indemnify any person injured by the delivery that files a notice of claim within one year after the delivery.

 

#### Section 47-7602. Judicial process against goods covered by negotiable document of title

Unless a document of title was originally issued on delivery of the goods by a person that did not have power to dispose of them, a lien does not attach by virtue of any judicial process to goods in the possession of a bailee for which a negotiable document of title is outstanding unless possession or control of the document is first surrendered to the bailee or the document’s negotiation is enjoined.  The bailee may not be compelled to deliver the goods pursuant to process until possession or control of the document is surrendered to the bailee or to the court.  A purchaser of the document for value without notice of the process or injunction takes free of the lien imposed by judicial process.

 

#### Section 47-7603. Conflicting claims; interpleader

If more than one person claim title to or possession of the goods, the bailee is excused from delivery until the bailee has a reasonable time to ascertain the validity of the adverse claims or to commence an action for interpleader.  The bailee may assert an interpleader either in defending an action for nondelivery of the goods or by original action.

 

### Article 7 - Miscellaneous Provisions

#### Section 47-7703. Applicability

This chapter applies to a document of title that is issued or a bailment that arises on or after the effective date of this chapter.   This chapter does not apply to a document of title that is issued or a bailment that arises before the effective date of this chapter even if the document of title or bailment  would be subject to this chapter if the document of title had been issued or bailment had arisen on or after the effective date of this chapter.  This chapter does not apply to a right of action that has accrued before the effective date of this chapter.

 

#### Section 47-7704. Savings clause

A document of title issued or a bailment that arises before the effective date of this chapter and the rights, obligations and interests flowing from that document or bailment are governed by any statute or other rule amended or repealed by this chapter as if amendment or repeal had not occurred and may be terminated, completed, consummated or enforced under that statute or other rule.

D. Unless the context shows that a different meaning is intended, a person who is required by other law, regulation, rule, or agreement to transfer, deliver, present, surrender, exchange or otherwise put in the possession of another person a security or financial asset satisfies that requirement by causing the other person to acquire an interest in the security or financial asset pursuant to subsection A or B of this section.

#### Section 47-8105. Notice of adverse claim

A. A person has notice of an adverse claim if:

1. The person knows of the adverse claim;

2. The person is aware of facts sufficient to indicate that there is a significant probability that the adverse claim exists and deliberately avoids information that would establish the existence of the adverse claim; or

3. The person has a duty, imposed by statute or regulation, to investigate whether an adverse claim exists, and the investigation so required would establish the existence of the adverse claim.

B. Having knowledge that a financial asset or interest therein is or has been transferred by a representative imposes no duty of inquiry into the rightfulness of a transaction and is not notice of an adverse claim. However, a person who knows that a representative has transferred a financial asset or interest therein in a transaction that is, or whose proceeds are being used, for the individual benefit of the representative or otherwise in breach of duty has notice of an adverse claim.

C. An act or event that creates a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation represented by a security certificate or sets a date on or after which the certificate is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange does not itself constitute notice of an adverse claim except in the case of a transfer more than:

1. One year after a date set for presentment or surrender for redemption or exchange; or

2. Six months after a date set for payment of money against presentation or surrender of the certificate, if money was available for payment on that date.

D. A purchaser of a certificated security has notice of an adverse claim if the security certificate:

1. Whether in bearer or registered form, has been indorsed "for collection" or "for surrender" or for some other purpose not involving transfer; or

2. Is in bearer form and has on it an unambiguous statement that it is the property of a person other than the transferor, but the mere writing of a name on the certificate is not such a statement.

E. Filing of a financing statement under chapter 9 of this title is not notice of an adverse claim to a financial asset.

#### Section 47-8106. Control

A. A purchaser has "control" of a certificated security in bearer form if the certificated security is delivered to the purchaser.

B. A purchaser has "control" of a certificated security in registered form if the certificated security is delivered to the purchaser, and:

1. The certificate is indorsed to the purchaser or in blank by an effective indorsement; or

2. The certificate is registered in the name of the purchaser, upon original issue or registration of transfer by the issuer.

C. A purchaser has "control" of an uncertificated security if:

1. The uncertificated security is delivered to the purchaser; or

2. The issuer has agreed that it will comply with instructions originated by the purchaser without further consent by the registered owner.

D. A purchaser has "control" of a security entitlement if:

1. The purchaser becomes the entitlement holder;

2. The securities intermediary has agreed that it will comply with entitlement orders originated by the purchaser without further consent by the entitlement holder; or

3. Another person has control of the security entitlement on behalf of the purchaser or, having previously acquired control of the security entitlement, acknowledges that it has control on behalf of the purchaser.

E. If an interest in a security entitlement is granted by the entitlement holder to the entitlement holder's own securities intermediary, the securities intermediary has control.

F. A purchaser who has satisfied the requirements of subsection C or D has control, even if the registered owner in the case of subsection C or the entitlement holder in the case of subsection D retains the right to make substitutions for the uncertificated security or security entitlement, to originate instructions or entitlement orders to the issuer or securities intermediary, or otherwise to deal with the uncertificated security or security entitlement.

G. An issuer or a securities intermediary may not enter into an agreement of the kind described in subsection C, paragraph 2 or subsection D, paragraph 2 without the consent of the registered owner or entitlement holder, but an issuer or a securities intermediary is not required to enter into such an agreement even though the registered owner or entitlement holder so directs. An issuer or securities intermediary that has entered into such an agreement is not required to confirm the existence of the agreement to another party unless requested to do so by the registered owner or entitlement holder.

#### Section 47-8107. Whether indorsement, instruction or entitlement order is effective

A. "Appropriate person" means:

1. With respect to an indorsement, the person specified by a security certificate or by an effective special indorsement to be entitled to the security;

2. With respect to an instruction, the registered owner of an uncertificated security;

3. With respect to an entitlement order, the entitlement holder;

4. If the person designated in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of this subsection is deceased, the designated person's successor taking under other law or the designated person's personal representative acting for the estate of the decedent; or

5. If the person designated in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of this subsection lacks capacity, the designated person's guardian, conservator or other similar representative who has power under other law to transfer the security or financial asset.

B. An indorsement, instruction or entitlement order is effective if:

1. It is made by the appropriate person;

2. It is made by a person who has power under the law of agency to transfer the security or financial asset on behalf of the appropriate person, including, in the case of an instruction or entitlement order, a person who has control under section 47-8106, subsection C, paragraph 2 or subsection D, paragraph 2; or

3. The appropriate person has ratified it or is otherwise precluded from asserting its ineffectiveness.

C. An indorsement, instruction or entitlement order made by a representative is effective even if:

1. The representative has failed to comply with a controlling instrument or with the law of the state having jurisdiction of the representative relationship, including any law requiring the representative to obtain court approval of the transaction; or

2. The representative's action in making the indorsement, instruction or entitlement order or using the proceeds of the transaction is otherwise a breach of duty.

D. If a security is registered in the name of or specially indorsed to a person described as a representative, or if a securities account is maintained in the name of a person described as a representative, an indorsement, instruction or entitlement order made by the person is effective even though the person is no longer serving in the described capacity.

E. Effectiveness of an indorsement, instruction or entitlement order is determined as of the date the indorsement, instruction or entitlement order is made, and an indorsement, instruction or entitlement order does not become ineffective by reason of any later change of circumstances.

#### Section 47-8108. Warranties in direct holding

A person who presents a certificated security for registration of transfer or for payment or exchange warrants to the issuer that the person is entitled to the registration, payment or exchange, but a purchaser for value and without notice of adverse claims to whom transfer is registered warrants only that the person has no knowledge of any unauthorized signature in a necessary indorsement.

G. If a person acts as agent of another in delivering a certificated security to a purchaser, the identity of the principal was known to the person to whom the certificate was delivered, and the certificate delivered by the agent was received by the agent from the principal or received by the agent from another person at the direction of the principal, the person delivering the security certificate warrants only that the delivering person has authority to act for the principal and does not know of any adverse claim to the certificated security.

H. A secured party who redelivers a security certificate received, or after payment and on order of the debtor delivers the security certificate to another person, makes only the warranties of an agent under subsection G.

I. Except as otherwise provided in subsection G, a broker acting for a customer makes to the issuer and a purchaser the warranties provided in subsections A through F. A broker that delivers a security certificate to its customer, or causes its customer to be registered as the owner of an uncertificated security, makes to the customer the warranties provided in subsection A or B, and has the rights and privileges of a purchaser under this section. The warranties of and in favor of the broker acting as an agent are in addition to applicable warranties given by and in favor of the customer.

#### Section 47-8110. Applicability; choice of law

A. The local law of the issuer's jurisdiction, as specified in subsection D, governs:

1. The validity of a security;

2. The rights and duties of the issuer with respect to registration of transfer;

3. The effectiveness of registration of transfer by the issuer;

4. Whether the issuer owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a security; and

5. Whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person to whom transfer of a certificated or uncertificated security is registered or a person who obtains control of an uncertificated security.

B. The local law of the securities intermediary's jurisdiction, as specified in subsection F, governs:

1. Acquisition of a security entitlement from the securities intermediary;

2. The rights and duties of the securities intermediary and entitlement holder arising out of a security entitlement;

3. Whether the securities intermediary owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a security entitlement; and

4. Whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person who acquires a security entitlement from the securities intermediary or a person who purchases a security entitlement or interest therein from an entitlement holder.

C. The local law of the jurisdiction in which a security certificate is located at the time of delivery governs whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person to whom the security certificate is delivered.

D. "Issuer's jurisdiction" means the jurisdiction under which the issuer of the security is organized or, if permitted by the law of that jurisdiction, the law of another jurisdiction specified by the issuer. An issuer organized under the law of this state may specify the law of another jurisdiction as the law governing the matters specified in subsection A, paragraphs 2 through 5.

E. The following rules determine a "securities intermediary's jurisdiction" for purposes of this section:

1. If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder governing the securities account expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction for purposes of this article or this chapter, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction.

2. If paragraph 1 of this subsection does not apply and an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder governing the securities account expressly provides that the agreement is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction.

3. If neither paragraph 1 nor paragraph 2 of this subsection applies and an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder governing the securities account expressly provides that the securities account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction.

4. If none of the preceding paragraphs in this subsection applies, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the entitlement holder's account is located.

5. If none of the preceding paragraphs in this subsection applies, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which the chief executive office of the securities intermediary is located.

F. A securities intermediary's jurisdiction is not determined by the physical location of certificates representing financial assets, or by the jurisdiction in which is organized the issuer of the financial asset with respect to which an entitlement holder has a security entitlement, or by the location of facilities for data processing or other record keeping concerning the account.

#### Section 47-8111. Clearing corporation rules

A rule adopted by a clearing corporation governing rights and obligations among the clearing corporation and its participants in the clearing corporation is effective even if the rule conflicts with this chapter and affects another party who does not consent to the rule.

#### Section 47-8112. Creditor's legal process

A. The interest of a debtor in a certificated security may be reached by a creditor only by actual seizure of the security certificate by the officer making the attachment or levy, except as otherwise provided in subsection D. However, a certificated security for which the certificate has been surrendered to the issuer may be reached by a creditor by legal process upon the issuer.

B. The interest of a debtor in an uncertificated security may be reached by a creditor only by legal process upon the issuer at its chief executive office in the United States, except as otherwise provided in subsection D.

C. The interest of a debtor in a security entitlement may be reached by a creditor only by legal process upon the securities intermediary with whom the debtor's securities account is maintained, except as otherwise provided in subsection D.

D. The interest of a debtor in a certificated security for which the certificate is in the possession of a secured party, or in an uncertificated security registered in the name of a secured party, or a security entitlement maintained in the name of a secured party, may be reached by a creditor by legal process upon the secured party.

E. A creditor whose debtor is the owner of a certificated security, uncertificated security or security entitlement is entitled to aid from a court of competent jurisdiction, by injunction or otherwise, in reaching the certificated security, uncertificated security or security entitlement or in satisfying the claim by means allowed at law or in equity in regard to property that cannot readily be reached by other legal process.

#### Section 47-8113. Statute of frauds inapplicable

A contract or modification of a contract for the sale or purchase of a security is enforceable whether or not there is a writing signed or record authenticated by a party against whom enforcement is sought, even if the contract or modification is not capable of performance within one year of its making.

#### Section 47-8114. Evidentiary rules concerning certificated securities

The following rules apply in an action on a certificated security against the issuer:

1. Unless specifically denied in the pleadings, each signature on a security certificate or in a necessary indorsement is admitted.

2. If the effectiveness of a signature is put in issue, the burden of establishing effectiveness is on the party claiming under the signature, but the signature is presumed to be genuine or authorized.

3. If signatures on a security certificate are admitted or established, production of the certificate entitles a holder to recover on it unless the defendant establishes a defense or a defect going to the validity of the security.

4. If it is shown that a defense or defect exists, the plaintiff has the burden of establishing that the plaintiff or some person under whom the plaintiff claims is a person against whom the defense or defect cannot be asserted.

#### Section 47-8115. Securities intermediary and others not liable to adverse claimant

A securities intermediary that has transferred a financial asset pursuant to an effective entitlement order, or a broker or other agent or bailee that has dealt with a financial asset at the direction of its customer or principal, is not liable to a person having an adverse claim to the financial asset, unless the securities intermediary, broker or other agent or bailee:

1. Took the action after it had been served with an injunction, restraining order or other legal process enjoining it from doing so, issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, and had a reasonable opportunity to act on the injunction, restraining order or other legal process;

2. Acted in collusion with the wrongdoer in violating the rights of the adverse claimant; or

3. In the case of a security certificate that has been stolen, acted with notice of the adverse claim.

#### Section 47-8116. Securities intermediary as purchaser for value

A securities intermediary that receives a financial asset and establishes a security entitlement to the financial asset in favor of an entitlement holder is a purchaser for value of the financial asset. A securities intermediary that acquires a security entitlement to a financial asset from another securities intermediary acquires the security entitlement for value if the securities intermediary acquiring the security entitlement establishes a security entitlement to the financial asset in favor of an entitlement holder.

### Article 2 - Issue and Issuer

#### Section 47-8201. Issuer

A. With respect to an obligation on or a defense to a security, an "issuer" includes a person that:

1. Places or authorizes the placing of its name on a security certificate, other than as authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent, or the like, to evidence a share, participation or other interest in its property or in an enterprise or to evidence its duty to perform an obligation represented by the certificate;

2. Creates a share, participation or other interest in its property or in an enterprise, or undertakes an obligation, that is an uncertificated security;

3. Directly or indirectly creates a fractional interest in its rights or property, if the fractional interest is represented by a security certificate; or

4. Becomes responsible for, or in place of, another person described as an issuer in this section.

B. With respect to an obligation on or defense to a security, a guarantor is an issuer to the extent of its guaranty, whether or not its obligation is noted on a security certificate.

C. With respect to a registration of a transfer, issuer means a person on whose behalf transfer books are maintained.

#### Section 47-8202. Issuer's responsibility and defenses; notice of defect or defense

A. Even against a purchaser for value and without notice, the terms of a certificated security include terms stated on the certificate and terms made part of the security by reference on the certificate to another instrument, indenture or document or to a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order or the like, to the extent the terms referred to do not conflict with terms stated on the certificate. A reference under this subsection does not of itself charge a purchaser for value with notice of a defect going to the validity of the security, even if the certificate expressly states that a person accepting it admits notice. The terms of an uncertificated security include those stated in any instrument, indenture or document or in a constitution, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, order, or the like, pursuant to which the security is issued.

B. The following rules apply if an issuer asserts that a security is not valid:

1. A security other than one issued by a government or governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality, even though issued with a defect going to its validity, is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the particular defect unless the defect involves a violation of a constitutional provision. In that case, the security is valid in the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice of the defect, other than one who takes by original issue.

2. Paragraph 1 of this subsection applies to an issuer that is a government or governmental subdivision, agency or instrumentality only if there has been substantial compliance with the legal requirements governing the issue or the issuer has received a substantial consideration for the issue as a whole or for the particular security and a stated purpose of the issue is one for which the issuer has power to borrow money or issue the security.

C. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-8205, lack of genuineness of a certificated security is a complete defense, even against a purchaser for value and without notice.

D. All other defenses of the issuer of a security, including nondelivery and conditional delivery of a certificated security, are ineffective against a purchaser for value who has taken the certificated security without notice of the particular defense.

E. This section does not affect the right of a party to cancel a contract for a security "when, as and if issued" or "when distributed" in the event of a material change in the character of the security that is the subject of the contract or in the plan or arrangement pursuant to which the security is to be issued or distributed.

F. If a security is held by a securities intermediary against whom an entitlement holder has a security entitlement with respect to the security, the issuer may not assert any defense that the issuer could not assert if the entitlement holder held the security directly.

#### Section 47-8203. Staleness as notice of defect or defense

After an act or event, other than a call that has been revoked, creating a right to immediate performance of the principal obligation represented by a certificated security or setting a date on or after which the security is to be presented or surrendered for redemption or exchange, a purchaser is charged with notice of any defect in its issue or defense of the issuer, if the act or event:

1. Requires the payment of money, the delivery of a certificated security, the registration of transfer of an uncertificated security, or any of them on presentation or surrender of the security certificate, the money or security is available on the date set for payment or exchange, and the purchaser takes the security more than one year after that date; or

2. Is not covered by paragraph 1 and the purchaser takes the security more than two years after the date set for surrender or presentation or the date on which performance became due.

#### Section 47-8204. Effect of issuer's restriction on transfer

A restriction on transfer of a security imposed by the issuer, even if otherwise lawful, is ineffective against a person without knowledge of the restriction unless:

1. The security is certificated and the restriction is noted conspicuously on the security certificate; or

2. The security is uncertificated and the registered owner has been notified of the restriction.

#### Section 47-8205. Effect of unauthorized signature on security certificate

An unauthorized signature placed on a security certificate before or in the course of issue is ineffective, but the signature is effective in favor of a purchaser for value of the certificated security if the purchaser is without notice of the lack of authority and the signing has been done by:

1. An authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent or other person entrusted by the issuer with the signing of the security certificate or of similar security certificates, or the immediate preparation for signing of any of them; or

2. An employee of the issuer, or of any of the persons listed in paragraph 1, entrusted with responsible handling of the security certificate.

#### Section 47-8206. Completion or alteration of security certificate

A. If a security certificate contains the signatures necessary to its issue or transfer but is incomplete in any other respect:

1. Any person may complete it by filling in the blank as authorized; and

2. Even if the blanks are incorrectly filled in, the security certificate as completed is enforceable by a purchaser who took it for value and without notice of the incorrectness.

B. A complete security certificate that has been improperly altered, even if fraudulently, remains enforceable, but only according to its original terms.

#### Section 47-8207. Rights and duties of issuer with respect to registered owners

A. Before due presentment for registration of transfer of a certificated security in registered form or of an instruction requesting registration of transfer of an uncertificated security, the issuer or indenture trustee may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled to vote, receive notifications and otherwise exercise all the rights and powers of an owner.

B. This chapter does not affect the liability of the registered owner of a security for a call, assessment or the like.

#### Section 47-8208. Effect of signature of authenticating trustee, registrar or transfer agent

A. A person signing a security certificate as authenticating trustee, registrar, transfer agent, or the like, warrants to a purchaser for value of the certificated security, if the purchaser is without notice of a particular defect, that:

1. The certificate is genuine;

2. The person's own participation in the issue of the security is within the person's capacity and within the scope of the authority received by the person from the issuer; and

3. The person has reasonable grounds to believe that the certificated security is in the form and within the amount the issuer is authorized to issue.

B. Unless otherwise agreed, a person signing under subsection A does not assume responsibility for the validity of the security in other respects.

#### Section 47-8209. Issuer's lien

A lien in favor of an issuer upon a certificated security is valid against a purchaser only if the right of the issuer to the lien is noted conspicuously on the security certificate.

#### Section 47-8210. Overissue

A. In this section, "overissue" means the issue of securities in excess of the amount the issuer has corporate power to issue, but an overissue does not occur if appropriate action has cured the overissue.

B. Except as otherwise provided in subsections C and D, the provisions of this chapter which validate a security or compel its issue or reissue do not apply to the extent that validation, issue or reissue would result in overissue.

C. If an identical security not constituting an overissue is reasonably available for purchase, a person entitled to issue or validation may compel the issuer to purchase the security and deliver it if certificated or register its transfer if uncertificated, against surrender of any security certificate the person holds.

D. If a security is not reasonably available for purchase, a person entitled to issue or validation may recover from the issuer the price the person or the last purchaser for value paid for it with interest from the date of the person's demand.

### Article 3 - Transfer of Certificated and Uncertificated Securities

#### Section 47-8301. Delivery

A. Delivery of a certificated security to a purchaser occurs when:

1. The purchaser acquires possession of the security certificate;

2. Another person, other than a securities intermediary, either acquires possession of the security certificate on behalf of the purchaser or, having previously acquired possession of the certificate, acknowledges that it holds for the purchaser; or

3. A securities intermediary acting on behalf of the purchaser acquires possession of the security certificate, only if the certificate is in registered form and is registered in the name of the purchaser, payable to the order of the purchaser or specially indorsed to the purchaser by an effective indorsement and has not been indorsed to the securities intermediary or in blank.

B. Delivery of an uncertificated security to a purchaser occurs when:

1. The issuer registers the purchaser as the registered owner, upon original issue or registration of transfer; or

2. Another person, other than a securities intermediary, either becomes the registered owner of the uncertificated security on behalf of the purchaser or, having previously become the registered owner, acknowledges that it holds for the purchaser.

#### Section 47-8302. Rights of purchaser

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsections B and C, a purchaser of a certificated or uncertificated security acquires all rights in the security that the transferor had or had power to transfer.

B. A purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased.

C. A purchaser of a certificated security who as a previous holder had notice of an adverse claim does not improve its position by taking from a protected purchaser.

#### Section 47-8303. Protected purchaser

A. "Protected purchaser" means a purchaser of a certificated or uncertificated security, or of an interest therein, who:

1. Gives value;

2. Does not have notice of any adverse claim to the security; and

3. Obtains control of the certificated or uncertificated security.

B. In addition to acquiring the rights of a purchaser, a protected purchaser also acquires its interest in the security free of any adverse claim.

#### Section 47-8304. Indorsement

A. An indorsement may be in blank or special. An indorsement in blank includes an indorsement to bearer. A special indorsement specifies to whom a security is to be transferred or who has power to transfer it. A holder may convert a blank indorsement to a special indorsement.

B. An indorsement purporting to be only of part of a security certificate representing units intended by the issuer to be separately transferable is effective to the extent of the indorsement.

C. An indorsement, whether special or in blank, does not constitute a transfer until delivery of the certificate on which it appears or, if the indorsement is on a separate document, until delivery of both the document and the certificate.

D. If a security certificate in registered form has been delivered to a purchaser without a necessary indorsement, the purchaser may become a protected purchaser only when the indorsement is supplied. However, against a transferor, a transfer is complete upon delivery and the purchaser has a specifically enforceable right to have any necessary indorsement supplied.

E. An indorsement of a security certificate in bearer form may give notice of an adverse claim to the certificate, but it does not otherwise affect a right to registration that the holder possesses.

F. Unless otherwise agreed, a person making an indorsement assumes only the obligations provided in section 47-8108 and not an obligation that the security will be honored by the issuer.

#### Section 47-8305. Instruction

A. If an instruction has been originated by an appropriate person but is incomplete in any other respect, any person may complete it as authorized and the issuer may rely on it as completed, even though it has been completed incorrectly.

B. Unless otherwise agreed, a person initiating an instruction assumes only the obligations imposed by section 47-8108 and not an obligation that the security will be honored by the issuer.

#### Section 47-8306. Effect of guaranteeing signature, indorsement or instruction

A. A person who guarantees a signature of an indorser of a security certificate warrants that at the time of signing:

1. The signature was genuine;

2. The signer was an appropriate person to indorse, or if the signature is by an agent, the agent had actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate person; and

3. The signer had legal capacity to sign.

B. A person who guarantees a signature of the originator of an instruction warrants that at the time of signing:

1. The signature was genuine;

2. The signer was an appropriate person to originate the instruction, or if the signature is by an agent, the agent had actual authority to act on behalf of the appropriate person, if the person specified in the instruction as the registered owner was, in fact, the registered owner, as to which fact the signature guarantor does not make a warranty; and

3. The signer had legal capacity to sign.

C. A person who specially guarantees the signature of an originator of an instruction makes the warranties of a signature guarantor under subsection B and also warrants that at the time the instruction is presented to the issuer:

1. The person specified in the instruction as the registered owner of the uncertificated security will be the registered owner; and

2. The transfer of the uncertificated security requested in the instruction will be registered by the issuer free from all liens, security interests, restrictions and claims other than those specified in the instruction.

D. A guarantor under subsections A and B or a special guarantor under subsection C does not otherwise warrant the rightfulness of the transfer.

E. A person who guarantees an indorsement of a security certificate makes the warranties of a signature guarantor under subsection A and also warrants the rightfulness of the transfer in all respects.

F. A person who guarantees an instruction requesting the transfer of an uncertificated security makes the warranties of a special signature guarantor under subsection C and also warrants the rightfulness of the transfer in all respects.

G. An issuer may not require a special guaranty of signature, a guaranty of indorsement, or a guaranty of instruction as a condition to registration of transfer.

H. The warranties under this section are made to a person taking or dealing with the security in reliance on the guaranty, and the guarantor is liable to the person for loss resulting from their breach.

1. So requests before the issuer has notice that the certificate has been acquired by a protected purchaser;

2. Files with the issuer a sufficient indemnity bond; and

3. Satisfies other reasonable requirements imposed by the issuer.

B. If, after the issue of a new security certificate, a protected purchaser of the original certificate presents it for registration of transfer, the issuer shall register the transfer unless an overissue would result.

E. An action based on the entitlement holder's property interest with respect to a particular financial asset under subsection A of this section, whether framed in conversion, replevin, constructive trust, equitable lien, or other theory, may not be asserted against any purchaser of a financial asset or interest therein who gives value, obtains control and does not act in collusion with the securities intermediary in violating the securities intermediary's obligations under section 47-8504.

If the securities intermediary does not reestablish a security entitlement, the securities intermediary is liable to the entitlement holder for damages.

#### Section 47-8508. Duty of securities intermediary to change entitlement holder's position to other form of security holding

#### Section 47-9103. Purchase money security interest; application of payments; burden of establishing

A. In this section:

1. "Purchase money collateral" means goods or software that secures a purchase money obligation incurred with respect to that collateral.

2. "Purchase money obligation" means an obligation of an obligor incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral or for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of the collateral if the value is in fact so used.

B. A security interest in goods is a purchase money security interest:

1. To the extent that the goods are purchase money collateral with respect to that security interest;

2. If the security interest is in inventory that is or was purchase money collateral, also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase money obligation incurred with respect to other inventory in which the secured party holds or held a purchase money security interest; and

3. Also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase money obligation incurred with respect to software in which the secured party holds or held a purchase money security interest.

C. A security interest in software is a purchase money security interest to the extent that the security interest also secures a purchase money obligation incurred with respect to goods in which the secured party holds or held a purchase money security interest if:

1. The debtor acquired its interest in the software in an integrated transaction in which it acquired an interest in the goods; and

2. The debtor acquired its interest in the software for the principal purpose of using the software in the goods.

D. The security interest of a consignor in goods that are the subject of a consignment is a purchase money security interest in inventory.

E. In a transaction other than a consumer goods transaction, if the extent to which a security interest is a purchase money security interest depends on the application of a payment to a particular obligation, the payment must be applied:

1. In accordance with any reasonable method of application to which the parties agree;

2. In the absence of the parties' agreement to a reasonable method, in accordance with any intention of the obligor manifested at or before the time of payment; or

3. In the absence of an agreement to a reasonable method and a timely manifestation of the obligor's intention, in the following order:

(a) To obligations that are not secured; and

(b) If more than one obligation is secured, to obligations secured by purchase money security interests in the order in which those obligations were incurred.

F. In a transaction other than a consumer goods transaction, a purchase money security interest does not lose its status as such, even if:

1. The purchase money collateral also secures an obligation that is not a purchase money obligation;

2. Collateral that is not purchase money collateral also secures the purchase money obligation; or

3. The purchase money obligation has been renewed, refinanced, consolidated or restructured.

G. In a transaction other than a consumer goods transaction, a secured party claiming a purchase money security interest has the burden of establishing the extent to which the security interest is a purchase money security interest.

H. The limitation of the rules in subsections E, F and G to transactions other than consumer goods transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer goods transactions. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer goods transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.

A. A secured party has control of a deposit account if:

1. The secured party is the bank with which the deposit account is maintained;

1. The collateral by those terms or as investment property; or

2. The underlying financial asset or commodity contract.

#### Section 47-9333. Priority of certain liens arising by operation of law

A. In this section, "possessory lien" means an interest, other than a security interest or an agricultural lien:

1. That secures payment or performance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the ordinary course of the person's business;

2. That is created by statute or rule of law in favor of the person; and

3. Whose effectiveness depends on the person's possession of the goods.

B. A possessory lien on goods has priority over a security interest in the goods unless the lien is created by a statute that expressly provides otherwise.

#### Section 47-9334. Priority of security interests in fixtures and crops

A. A security interest under this chapter may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures. A security interest does not exist under this chapter in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land.

B. This chapter does not prevent creation of an encumbrance on fixtures under real property law.

C. In cases not governed by subsections D through H of this section, a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor.

D. Except as otherwise provided in subsection H of this section, a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and:

1. The security interest is a purchase money security interest;

2. The interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures; and

3. The security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days thereafter.

E. A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:

1. The debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest:

(a) Is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record; and

(b) Has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner;

2. Before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this chapter and the fixtures are readily removable:

(a) Factory or office machines;

(b) Equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property; or

(c) Replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods;

3. The conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this chapter; or

4. The security interest is:

(a) Created in a manufactured home in a manufactured home transaction; and

(b) Perfected pursuant to a statute described in section 47-9311, subsection A, paragraph 2.

F. A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if:

1. The encumbrancer or owner has consented, in an authenticated record, to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or

2. The debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner.

G. The priority of the security interest under subsection F, paragraph 2 of this section continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates.

H. A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates. Except as otherwise provided in subsections E and F of this section, a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage.

I. A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property.

 

 

#### Section 47-9335. Accessions

A. A security interest may be created in an accession and continues in collateral that becomes an accession.

B. If a security interest is perfected when the collateral becomes an accession, the security interest remains perfected in the collateral.

C. Except as otherwise provided in subsection D of this section, the other provisions of this article determine the priority of a security interest in an accession.

D. A security interest in an accession is subordinate to a security interest in the whole that is perfected by compliance with the requirements of a certificate of title statute under section 47-9311, subsection B.

E. After default, subject to article 6 of this chapter, a secured party may remove an accession from other goods if the security interest in the accession has priority over the claims of every person having an interest in the whole.

F. A secured party that removes an accession from other goods under subsection E of this section shall promptly reimburse any holder of a security interest or other lien on, or owner of, the whole or of the other goods, other than the debtor, for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the whole or the other goods. The secured party need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the obligation to reimburse.

#### Section 47-9336. Commingled goods

A. In this section, "commingled goods" means goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that their identity is lost in a product or mass.

B. A security interest does not exist in commingled goods as such. However, a security interest may attach to a product or mass that results when goods become commingled goods.

C. If collateral becomes commingled goods, a security interest attaches to the product or mass.

D. If a security interest in collateral is perfected before the collateral becomes commingled goods, the security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection C is perfected.

E. Except as otherwise provided in subsection F, the other provisions of this article determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection C.

F. If more than one security interest attaches to the product or mass under subsection C, the following rules determine priority:

1. A security interest that is perfected under subsection D has priority over a security interest that is unperfected at the time the collateral becomes commingled goods.

2. If more than one security interest is perfected under subsection D, the security interests rank equally in proportion to the value of the collateral at the time it became commingled goods.

#### Section 47-9337. Priority of security interests in goods covered by certificate of title

If, while a security interest in goods is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction, this state issues a certificate of title that does not show that the goods are subject to the security interest or contain a statement that they may be subject to security interests not shown on the certificate:

1. A buyer of the goods, other than a person in the business of selling goods of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the goods after issuance of the certificate and without knowledge of the security interest; and

2. The security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest in the goods that attaches, and is perfected under section 47-9311, subsection B, after issuance of the certificate and without the conflicting secured party's knowledge of the security interest.

#### Section 47-9338. Priority of security interest or agricultural lien perfected by filed financing statement providing certain incorrect information

If a security interest or agricultural lien is perfected by a filed financing statement providing information that is described in section 47-9516, subsection B, paragraph 5 and that is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed:

1. The security interest or agricultural lien is subordinate to a conflicting perfected security interest in the collateral to the extent that the holder of the conflicting security interest gives value in reasonable reliance on the incorrect information; and

2. A purchaser, other than a secured party, of the collateral takes free of the security interest or agricultural lien to the extent that, in reasonable reliance on the incorrect information, the purchaser gives value and, in the case of tangible chattel paper, tangible documents, goods, instruments or a security certificate, receives delivery of the collateral.

 

#### Section 47-9339. Priority subject to subordination

This chapter does not preclude subordination by agreement by a person entitled to priority.

#### Section 47-9340. Effectiveness of right of recoupment or setoff against deposit account

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection C of this section, a bank with which a deposit account is maintained may exercise any right of recoupment or setoff against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account.

B. Except as otherwise provided in subsection C of this section, the application of this chapter to a security interest in a deposit account does not affect a right of recoupment or setoff of the secured party as to a deposit account maintained with the secured party.

C. The exercise by a bank of a setoff against a deposit account is ineffective against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account that is perfected by control under section 47-9104, subsection A, paragraph 3, if the setoff is based on a claim against the debtor.

#### Section 47-9341. Bank's rights and duties with respect to deposit account

Except as otherwise provided in section 47-9340, subsection C, and unless the bank otherwise agrees in an authenticated record, a bank's rights and duties with respect to a deposit account maintained with the bank are not terminated, suspended or modified by:

1. The creation, attachment or perfection of a security interest in the deposit account;

2. The bank's knowledge of the security interest; or

3. The bank's receipt of instructions from the secured party.

B. An agreement between the debtor and secured party that prohibits a transfer of the debtor's rights in collateral or makes the transfer a default does not prevent the transfer from taking effect.

#### Section 47-9402. Secured party not obligated on contract of debtor or in tort

The existence of a security interest, agricultural lien or authority given to a debtor to dispose of or use collateral, without more, does not subject a secured party to liability in contract or tort for the debtor's acts or omissions.

#### Section 47-9403. Agreement not to assert defenses against assignee

A. In this section, "value" has the meaning provided in section 47-3303, subsection A.

1. For value;

2. In good faith;

3. Without notice of a claim of a property or possessory right to the property assigned; and

4. Without notice of a defense or claim in recoupment of the type that may be asserted against a person entitled to enforce a negotiable instrument under section 47-3305, subsection A.

C. Subsection B of this section does not apply to defenses of a type that may be asserted against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under section 47-3305, subsection B.

D. In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor's obligation, law other than this chapter requires that the record include a statement to the effect that the rights of an assignee are subject to claims or defenses that the account debtor could assert against the original obligee, and the record does not include such a statement:

1. The record has the same effect as if the record included such a statement; and

2. The account debtor may assert against an assignee those claims and defenses that would have been available if the record included such a statement.

E. This section is subject to law other than this chapter that establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family or household purposes.

F. Except as otherwise provided in subsection D of this section, this section does not displace law other than this chapter that gives effect to an agreement by an account debtor not to assert a claim or defense against an assignee.

A. Unless an account debtor has made an enforceable agreement not to assert defenses or claims, and subject to subsections B through E, the rights of an assignee are subject to:

1. All terms of the agreement between the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising from the transaction that gave rise to the contract; and

2. Any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor that accrues before the account debtor receives a notification of the assignment authenticated by the assignor or the assignee.

B. Subject to subsection C and except as otherwise provided in subsection D, the claim of an account debtor against an assignor may be asserted against an assignee under subsection A only to reduce the amount the account debtor owes.

C. This section is subject to law other than this chapter that establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family or household purposes.

E. This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable.

#### Section 47-9405. Modification of assigned contract

A. A modification of or substitution for an assigned contract is effective against an assignee if made in good faith.

D. Except as otherwise provided in subsection E of this section and sections 47-2A303 and 47-9407, and subject to subsection H of this section, a term in an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor or in a promissory note is ineffective to the extent that it:

2. A delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the term.

C.

#### Section 47-9504. Indication of collateral

A financing statement sufficiently indicates the collateral that it covers if the financing statement provides:

1. A description of the collateral pursuant to section 47-9108; or

2. An indication that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal property.

#### Section 47-9505. Filing and compliance with other statutes and treaties for consignments, leases, other bailments and other transactions

A. A consignor, lessor or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in section 47-9311, subsection A, using the terms "consignor", "consignee", "lessor", "lessee", "bailor", "bailee", "licensor", "licensee", "owner", "registered owner", "buyer", "seller" or words of similar import instead of the terms "secured party" and "debtor".

B. This article applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection A of this section and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under section 47-9311, subsection B, but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation. If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner or buyer that attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance.

#### Section 47-9506. Effect of errors or omissions

A. A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this article is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading.

B. Except as otherwise provided in subsection C of this section, a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 47-9503, subsection A is seriously misleading.

C. If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with section 47-9503, subsection A, the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading.

D. For purposes of section 47-9508, subsection B, the "debtor's correct name" in subsection C of this section means the correct name of the new debtor.

#### Section 47-9507. Effect of certain events on effectiveness of financing statement

A. A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition.

B. Except as otherwise provided in subsection C of this section and section 47-9508, a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under section 47-9506.

C. If the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under section 47-9503, subsection A so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under section 47-9506:

1. The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four months after, the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading; and

2. The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement that renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after the financing statement became seriously misleading.

 

#### Section 47-9508. Effectiveness of financing statement if new debtor becomes bound by security agreement

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a filed financing statement naming an original debtor is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights to the extent that the financing statement would have been effective had the original debtor acquired rights in the collateral.

B. If the difference between the name of the original debtor and that of the new debtor causes a filed financing statement that is effective under subsection A of this section to be seriously misleading under section 47-9506:

1. The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound under section 47-9203, subsection D; and

2. The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor more than four months after the new debtor becomes bound under section 47-9203, subsection D unless an initial financing statement providing the name of the new debtor is filed before the expiration of that time.

C. This section does not apply to collateral as to which a filed financing statement remains effective against the new debtor under section 47-9507, subsection A.

#### Section 47-9509. Persons entitled to file a record

A. A person may file an initial financing statement, amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement or amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if:

1. The debtor authorizes the filing in an authenticated record or pursuant to subsection B or C of this section; or

A. A filed record is effective only to the extent that it was filed by a person that may file it under section 47-9509.

B. A record authorized by one secured party of record does not affect the financing statement with respect to another secured party of record.

C. A continuation statement that is not filed within the six month period prescribed by section 47-9515, subsection D is ineffective.

#### Section 47-9511. Secured party of record

A.

If an initial financing statement is filed under section 47-9514, subsection A, the assignee named in the initial financing statement is the secured party of record with respect to the financing statement.

B. If an amendment of a financing statement that provides the name of a person as a secured party or a representative of a secured party is filed, the person named in the amendment is a secured party of record. If an amendment is filed under section 47-9514, subsection B, the assignee named in the amendment is a secured party of record.

C. A person remains a secured party of record until the filing of an amendment of the financing statement that deletes the person.

#### Section 47-9512. Amendment of financing statement

A. Subject to section 47-9509, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of or, subject to subsection E of this section, otherwise amend the information provided in a financing statement by filing an amendment that:

2. Purports to delete all secured parties of record and fails to provide the name of a new secured party of record.

F. A secured party may change the name or mailing address of the secured party in more than one financing statement by filing a master amendment setting forth the name of the secured party and file number of each financing statement and the new name or mailing address of the secured party.  The secured party shall also provide filing information in computer-readable form prescribed by the secretary of state.

 

 

#### Section 47-9513. Termination statement

A. A secured party shall cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to file a termination statement for the financing statement if the financing statement covers consumer goods and:

1. There is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation or otherwise give value; or

2. The debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement.

4. The debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement.

D. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-9510, upon the filing of a termination statement with the filing office, the financing statement to which the termination statement relates ceases to be effective.  Except as otherwise provided in section 47-9510, for purposes of section 47-9519, subsection G, section 47-9522, subsection A and section 47-9523, subsection C, the filing with the filing office of a termination statement relating to a financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a transmitting utility also causes the effectiveness of the financing statement to lapse.

#### Section 47-9514. Assignment of powers of secured party of record

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection C of this section, an initial financing statement may reflect an assignment of all of the secured party's power to authorize an amendment to the financing statement by providing the name and mailing address of the assignee as the name and address of the secured party.

D. A secured party of record may assign of record all of the secured party’s rights under more than one financing statement filed with the secretary of state by filing a master assignment setting forth the name of the secured party of record and file number of each financing statement and the name and mailing address of the assignee. The secured party shall also provide filing information in computer-readable form prescribed by the secretary of state.

C. The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection D of this section.  Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise.  If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value.

On the expiration of the five year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection C of this section, unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection D of this section. Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement.

F. If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed.

#### Section 47-9516. What constitutes filing; effectiveness of filing

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection B of this section, communication of a record to a filing office and tender of the filing fee or acceptance of the record by the filing office constitutes filing.

1. The record is not communicated by a method or medium of communication authorized by the filing office;

(a) In the case of an initial financing statement, the record does not provide a name for the debtor;

6. In the case of an assignment reflected in an initial financing statement under section 47-9514, subsection A or an amendment filed under section 47-9514, subsection B, the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the assignee; or

C. For the purposes of subsection B of this section:

2. A record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by section 47-9512, 47-9514 or 47-9518, is an initial financing statement.

D. A record that is communicated to the filing office with tender of the filing fee, but that the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set forth in subsection B of this section, is effective as a filed record except as against a purchaser of the collateral that gives value in reasonable reliance on the absence of the record from the files.

D. The remedies provided in this section are cumulative and are not exclusive to and do not limit any other legal or equitable remedies that may be available to any debtor, any obligor, any person named as a debtor or the owner or holder of collateral affected by a record that is unauthorized under section 47-9509 or contains a material misstatement or false claim.

E.

A debtor or consumer obligor is entitled without charge to one response to a request under this section during any six month period in which the secured party did not send to the debtor or consumer obligor an explanation pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 1 of this section. The secured party may require payment of a charge not exceeding twenty-five dollars for each additional response.

#### Section 47-9617. Rights of transferee of collateral

A. A secured party's disposition of collateral after default:

1. Transfers to a transferee for value all of the debtor's rights in the collateral;

2. Discharges the security interest under which the disposition is made; and

3. Discharges any subordinate security interest or other subordinate lien.

B. A transferee that acts in good faith takes free of the rights and interests described in subsection A, even if the secured party fails to comply with this article or the requirements of any judicial proceeding.

C. If a transferee does not take free of the rights and interests described in subsection A, the transferee takes the collateral subject to:

1. The debtor's rights in the collateral;

2. The security interest or agricultural lien under which the disposition is made; and

3. Any other security interest or other lien.

#### Section 47-9618. Rights and duties of certain secondary obligors

A. A secondary obligor acquires the rights and becomes obligated to perform the duties of the secured party after the secondary obligor:

1. Receives an assignment of a secured obligation from the secured party;

2. Receives a transfer of collateral from the secured party and agrees to accept the rights and assume the duties of the secured party; or

3. Is subrogated to the rights of a secured party with respect to collateral.

B. An assignment, transfer or subrogation described in subsection A of this section:

1. Is not a disposition of collateral under section 47-9610; and

2. Relieves the secured party of further duties under this chapter.

#### Section 47-9619. Transfer of record or legal title; definition

A. In this section, "transfer statement" means a record authenticated by a secured party and stating:

1. That the debtor has defaulted in connection with an obligation secured by specified collateral;

2. That the secured party has exercised its postdefault remedies with respect to the collateral;

3. That, by reason of the exercise, a transferee has acquired the rights of the debtor in the collateral; and

4. The name and mailing address of the secured party, debtor and transferee.

B. A transfer statement entitles the transferee to the transfer of record of all rights of the debtor in the collateral specified in the statement in any official filing, recording, registration or certificate of title system covering the collateral. If a transfer statement is presented with the applicable fee and request form to the official or office responsible for maintaining the system, the official or office shall:

1. Accept the transfer statement;

2. Promptly amend its records to reflect the transfer; and

3. If applicable, issue a new appropriate certificate of title in the name of the transferee.

C. A transfer of the record or legal title to collateral to a secured party under subsection B or otherwise is not of itself a disposition of collateral under this chapter and does not of itself relieve the secured party of its duties under this chapter.

#### Section 47-9620. Acceptance of collateral in full or partial satisfaction of obligation; compulsory disposition of collateral

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection G of this section, a secured party may accept collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if:

C. Except in a consumer goods transaction, a debtor or secondary obligor may waive the right to redeem collateral under section 47-9623 only by an agreement to that effect entered into and authenticated after default.

#### Section 47-9625. Remedies for secured party's failure to comply with chapter

A. If it is established that a secured party is not proceeding in accordance with this chapter, a court may order or restrain collection, enforcement or disposition of collateral on appropriate terms and conditions.

B. Subject to subsections C, D and F of this section, a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this chapter. Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor's inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing.

C. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-9628:

1. A person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection B of this section for its loss; and

2. If the collateral is consumer goods, a person that was a debtor or a secondary obligor at the time a secured party failed to comply with this article may recover for that failure in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge plus ten per cent of the principal amount of the obligation or the time price differential plus ten per cent of the cash price.

D. A debtor whose deficiency is eliminated under section 47-9626 may recover damages for the loss of any surplus. However, a debtor or secondary obligor whose deficiency is eliminated or reduced under section 47-9626 may not otherwise recover under subsection B of this section for noncompliance with the provisions of this article relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance.

E. In addition to any damages recoverable under subsection B of this section, the debtor, consumer obligor or person named as a debtor in a filed record, as applicable, may recover five hundred dollars in each case from a person that:

1. Fails to comply with section 47-9208;

2. Fails to comply with section 47-9209;

3. Files a record that the person is not entitled to file under section 47-9509, subsection A;

4. Fails to cause the secured party of record to file or send a termination statement as required by section 47-9513, subsection A or C;

5. Fails to comply with section 47-9616, subsection B, paragraph 1 and whose failure is part of a pattern, or consistent with a practice, of noncompliance; or

F. A debtor or consumer obligor may recover damages under subsection B of this section and, in addition, five hundred dollars in each case from a person that, without reasonable cause, fails to comply with a request under section 47-9210. A recipient of a request under section 47-9210 that never claimed an interest in the collateral or obligations that are the subject of a request under that section has a reasonable excuse for failure to comply with the request within the meaning of this subsection.

G. If a person fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under section 47-9210, the person may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against another person that is reasonably misled by the failure.

#### Section 47-9626. Action in which deficiency or surplus is in issue

A. In an action arising from a transaction, other than a consumer transaction, in which the amount of a deficiency or surplus is in issue, the following rules apply:

1. A secured party need not prove compliance with the provisions of this article relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance unless the debtor or a secondary obligor places the secured party's compliance in issue.

2. If the secured party's compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was conducted in accordance with this article.

3. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-9628, if a secured party fails to prove that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was conducted in accordance with the provisions of this article relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance, the liability of a debtor or a secondary obligor for a deficiency is limited to an amount by which the sum of the secured obligation, expenses and attorney fees exceeds the greater of:

(a) The proceeds of the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance; or

(b) The amount of proceeds that would have been realized had the noncomplying secured party proceeded in accordance with the provisions of this article relating to collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance.

4. For purposes of paragraph 3, subdivision (b), the amount of proceeds that would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses and attorney fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum.

5. If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under section 47-9615, subsection F, the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party or a secondary obligor would have brought.

B. The limitation of the rules in subsection A of this section to transactions other than consumer transactions is intended to leave to the court the determination of the proper rules in consumer transactions. The court may not infer from that limitation the nature of the proper rule in consumer transactions and may continue to apply established approaches.

#### Section 47-9627. Determination of whether conduct was commercially reasonable

A. The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner.

B. A disposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made:

1. In the usual manner on any recognized market;

2. At the price current in any recognized market at the time of the disposition; or

3. Otherwise in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition.

C. A collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance is commercially reasonable if it has been approved:

1. In a judicial proceeding;

2. By a bona fide creditors' committee;

3. By a representative of creditors; or

4. By an assignee for the benefit of creditors.

D. Approval under subsection C need not be obtained, and lack of approval does not mean that the collection, enforcement, disposition or acceptance is not commercially reasonable.

#### Section 47-9628. Nonliability and limitation on liability of secured party; liability of secondary obligor

A. Unless a secured party knows that a person is a debtor or obligor, knows the identity of the person and knows how to communicate with the person:

1. The secured party is not liable to the person, or to a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against the person, for failure to comply with this chapter; and

2. The secured party's failure to comply with this chapter does not affect the liability of the person for a deficiency.

B. A secured party is not liable because of its status as secured party:

1. To a person that is a debtor or obligor, unless the secured party knows:

(a) That the person is a debtor or obligor;

(b) The identity of the person; and

(c) How to communicate with the person; or

2. To a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against a person, unless the secured party knows:

(a) That the person is a debtor; and

(b) The identity of the person.

C. A secured party is not liable to any person, and a person's liability for a deficiency is not affected, because of any act or omission arising out of the secured party's reasonable belief that a transaction is not a consumer goods transaction or a consumer transaction or that goods are not consumer goods, if the secured party's belief is based on its reasonable reliance on:

1. A debtor's representation concerning the purpose for which collateral was to be used, acquired or held; or

2. An obligor's representation concerning the purpose for which a secured obligation was incurred.

D. A secured party is not liable to any person under section 47-9625, subsection C, paragraph 2 for its failure to comply with section 47-9616.

E. A secured party is not liable under section 47-9625, subsection C, paragraph 2 more than once with respect to any one secured obligation.

1. Transactions and liens that were not governed by chapter 9 of this title as it existed before July 1, 2001, were validly entered into or created before July 1, 2001 and would be subject to this chapter, as added in 1999, if they had been entered into or created after July 1, 2001, and the rights, duties and interests flowing from those transactions and liens remain valid after July 1, 2001; and

2. The transactions and liens may be terminated, completed, consummated and enforced as required or permitted by this chapter, as added in 1999, or by the law that otherwise would apply if this chapter had not taken effect.

#### Section 47-9703. Security interest perfected before effective date

A. A security interest that is enforceable immediately before July 1, 2001 and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time is a perfected security interest under this chapter, as added in 1999, if, on July 1, 2001, the applicable requirements for enforceability and perfection under this chapter, as added in 1999, are satisfied without further action.

B. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-9705, if, immediately before July 1, 2001, a security interest is enforceable and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time, but the applicable requirements for enforceability or perfection under this chapter, as added in 1999, are not satisfied on July 1, 2001, the security interest:

1. Is a perfected security interest for one year after July 1, 2001;

2. Remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest becomes enforceable under section 47-9203 before the year expires; and

3. Remains perfected thereafter only if the applicable requirements for perfection under this chapter, as added in 1999, are satisfied before the year expires.

 

#### Section 47-9704. Security interest unperfected before effective date

A security interest that is enforceable immediately before July 1, 2001 but that would be subordinate to the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time:

1. Remains an enforceable security interest for one year after July 1, 2001;

2. Remains enforceable thereafter if the security interest becomes enforceable under section 47-9203 on July 1, 2001 or within one year thereafter; and

#### Section 47-9705. Effectiveness of action taken before effective date

A. If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before July 1, 2001 and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before July 1, 2001, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under this chapter, as added in 1999, within one year after July 1, 2001. An attached security interest becomes unperfected one year after July 1, 2001 unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under this chapter, as added in 1999, before the expiration of that period.

B. The filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2001 is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under this chapter, as added in 1999.

This chapter, as added in 1999, does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that before July 1, 2001 is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former section 47-9103. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections D and E of this section and section 47-9706, the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of:

1. The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed; or

2. June 30, 2007.

D. The filing of a continuation statement after July 1, 2001 does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before July 1, 2001. However, on the timely filing of a continuation statement after July 1, 2001 and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in article 3 of this chapter, as added in 1999, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before July 1, 2001 continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.

E. Subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section applies to a financing statement that before July 1, 2001 is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former section 47-9103 only to the extent that article 3 of this chapter, as added in 1999, provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.

F. A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001 and a continuation statement filed after July 1, 2001 is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of article 5 of this chapter, as added in 1999, for an initial financing statement.

 

#### Section 47-9706. When initial financing statement suffices as continuation statement

A. The filing of an initial financing statement in the office specified in section 47-9501 continues the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001 if:

1. The filing of an initial financing statement in that office would be effective to perfect a security interest under this chapter, as added in 1999;

2. The pre-effective date financing statement was filed in an office in another state or another office in this state; and

3. The initial financing statement satisfies subsection B of this section.

B. The filing of an initial financing statement under subsection A of this section continues the effectiveness of the pre-effective date financing statement:

1. If the initial financing statement is filed before July 1, 2001, for the period provided in former section 47-9403 with respect to a financing statement; and

2. If the initial financing statement is filed before July 1, 2001, for the period provided in section 47-9515 with respect to an initial financing statement.

C. To be effective for purposes of subsection A of this section, an initial financing statement must:

1. Satisfy the requirements of article 5 of this chapter, as added in 1999, for an initial financing statement;

2. Identify the pre-effective date financing statement by indicating the office in which the financing statement was filed and providing the dates of filing and file numbers, if any, of the financing statement and of the most recent continuation statement filed with respect to the financing statement; and

#### Section 47-9707. Amendment of pre-effective-date financing statement; definition

A. In this section, "pre-effective-date financing statement" means a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001.

B. After July 1, 2001, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or otherwise amend the information provided in, a pre-effective-date financing statement only in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in article 3 of this chapter, as added in 1999. However, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement also may be terminated in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed.

C. Except as otherwise provided in subsection D of this section, if the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the information in a pre-effective-date financing statement may be amended after July 1, 2001 only if:

1. The pre-effective-date financing statement and an amendment are filed in the office specified in section 47-9501;

2. An amendment is filed in the office specified in section 47-9501 concurrently with, or after the filing in that office of, an initial financing statement that satisfies section 47-9706, subsection C; or

E. Whether or not the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement filed in this state may be terminated after July 1, 2001 by filing a termination statement in the office in which the pre-effective-date financing statement is filed, unless an initial financing statement that satisfies section 47-9706, subsection C has been filed in the office specified by the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in article 3 of this chapter, as added in 1999, as the office in which to file a financing statement.

 

#### Section 47-9708. Persons entitled to file initial financing statement or continuation statement

A person may file an initial financing statement or a continuation statement under this article if:

1. The secured party of record authorizes the filing; and

2. The filing is necessary under this article:

(a) To continue the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before July 1, 2001; or

(b) To perfect or continue the perfection of a security interest.

#### Section 47-9709. Priority

A. This chapter, as added in 1999, determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral. However, if the relative priorities of the claims were established before July 1, 2001, chapter 9 of this title as it existed before July 1, 2001 determines priority.

B. For purposes of section 47-9322, subsection A, the priority of a security interest that becomes enforceable under section 47-9203 dates from July 1, 2001 if the security interest is perfected under this chapter, as added in 1999, by the filing of a financing statement before July 1, 2001 that would not have been effective to perfect the security interest under chapter 9 of this title as it existed before July 1, 2001. This subsection does not apply to conflicting security interests each of which is perfected by the filing of such a financing statement.

 

### Article 8 - 2014 Transition

#### Section 47-9802. Security interest perfected before effective date

A. A security interest that is a perfected security interest immediately before the effective date of this section is a perfected security interest under this chapter, as amended in 2014, if, on the effective date of this section, the applicable requirements for attachment and perfection under this chapter, as amended in 2014, are satisfied without further action.

B. Except as otherwise provided in section 47-9804, if, immediately before the effective date of this section, a security interest is a perfected security interest, but the applicable requirements for perfection under this chapter, as amended in 2014, are not satisfied on the effective date of this section, the security interest remains perfected thereafter only if the applicable requirements for perfection under this chapter, as amended in 2014, are satisfied within one year after the effective date of this section.

 

#### Section 47-9803. Security interest unperfected before effective date

A security interest that is an unperfected security interest immediately before the effective date of this section becomes a perfected security interest:

1. Without further action, on the effective date of this section if the applicable requirements for perfection under this chapter, as amended in 2014, are satisfied before or at that time; or

2. When the applicable requirements for perfection are satisfied if the requirements are satisfied after that time.

 

#### Section 47-9804. Effectiveness of action taken before effective date

However, except as otherwise provided in subsections C and D of this section and section 47-9805, the financing statement ceases to be effective:

1. If the financing statement is filed in this state, at the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective had the 2014 amendments to this chapter not taken effect; or

(a) The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of that jurisdiction; or

(b) August 31, 2019.

C. The filing of a continuation statement on or after the effective date of this section does not continue the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before the effective date of this section. However, on the timely filing of a continuation statement on or after the effective date of this section and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this chapter as amended in 2014, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before the effective date of this section continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction.

D. Subsection B, paragraph 2, subdivision (b) of this section applies to a financing statement that, before the effective date of this section, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this chapter as added in 1999, only to the extent that this chapter, as amended in 2014, provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement.

E. A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before the effective date of this section and a continuation statement filed after one month before the effective date of this section is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of article 5 of this chapter, as amended in 2014, for an initial financing statement. A financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a decedent's estate indicates that the collateral is being administered by a personal representative within the meaning of section 47-9503, subsection A, paragraph 2, as amended in 2014.  A financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a trust or is a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust indicates that the collateral is held in a trust within the meaning of section 47-9503, subsection A, paragraph 3, as amended in 2014.

D. If the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre-effective date financing statement may be continued only under section 47-9804, subsections C and E or section 47-9805.

E. Whether or not the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre-effective date financing statement filed in this state may be terminated on or after the effective date of this section by filing a termination statement in the office in which the pre-effective date financing statement is filed, unless an initial financing statement that satisfies section 47-9805, subsection C has been filed in the office specified by the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in this chapter, as amended in 2014, as the office in which to file a financing statement.
