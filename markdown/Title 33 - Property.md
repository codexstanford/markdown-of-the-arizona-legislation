### Article 3 - Arizona Coordinate System, 1983

#### Section 33-131. Arizona coordinate system, 1983; zones; composition

A. The Arizona coordinate system, 1983, is the system of plane coordinates which has been established by the national geodetic survey for defining and stating the positions or locations of points on the surface of the earth in this state.

B. The Arizona coordinate system, 1983, contains three zones as follows:

1. The west zone, composed of La Paz, Mohave and Yuma counties.

2. The central zone, composed of Coconino, Maricopa, Pima, Pinal, Santa Cruz and Yavapai counties.

3. The east zone, composed of Apache, Cochise, Gila, Graham, Greenlee and Navajo counties.

C. In any land description in which the Arizona coordinate system, 1983, is utilized the system shall be designated "Arizona coordinate system, 1983, __________ zone", with the name of the appropriate zone inserted.

#### Section 33-132. Coordinates of system; zone definitions

A. The plane coordinates of a point on the earth's surface, to be used in the position or location of such point in the appropriate zone of the system, shall consist of two distances, expressed in feet and decimals of a foot (foot value 0.3048 meter exact). One of these distances, to be known as the "X-coordinate", shall give the position in an east-and-west direction, and the other, to be known as the "Y-coordinate", shall give the position in a north-and-south direction. These coordinates shall depend on and conform to the coordinates on the Arizona coordinate system, 1983, of the horizontal control stations of the national geodetic survey in this state, as these coordinates have been determined by the survey.

B. For the purpose of more precisely defining the Arizona coordinate system, the following definitions of the national geodetic survey are adopted:

1. The Arizona coordinate system, 1983, west zone, is a transverse mercator projection of the North American datum, 1983, having a central meridian 113 o 45' 00" west of Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set one part in fifteen thousand too small. The origin of the coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 113 o 45' 00" west of Greenwich and the parallel of 31 o 00' 00" north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates of "X" equals seven hundred thousand feet and "Y" equals zero feet.

2. The Arizona coordinate system, 1983, central zone, is a transverse mercator projection of the North American datum, 1983, having a central meridian 111 o 55' 00" west of Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set at one part in ten thousand too small. The origin of the coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 111 o 55' 00" west of Greenwich and the parallel of 31 o 00' 00" north latitude. This origin is given the coordinates of "X" equals seven hundred thousand feet and "Y" equals zero feet.

3. The Arizona coordinate system, 1983, east zone, is a transverse mercator projection of the North American datum, 1983, having a central meridian 110 o 10' 00" west of Greenwich, on which meridian the scale is set at one part in ten thousand too small. The origin of coordinates is at the intersection of the meridian 110 o 10' 00" west of Greenwich and the parallel of 31 o 00' 00" north latitude. The origin is given the coordinates of "X" equals seven hundred thousand feet and "Y" equals zero feet.

#### Section 33-133. Ground markings of system; accuracy specifications; horizontal control stations

A. The position of the Arizona coordinate system shall be marked on the ground by horizontal control stations which have been established in conformity with standards adopted by the federal geodetic control committee for first order, second order class I or second order class II surveys or equivalent standards adopted by successors, at the time the surveys were made and computed on the North American datum, 1983.

B. A horizontal control station normally consists of, if practicable, a group of bronze or brass discs imbedded in concrete posts nearly flush with the ground surface or cemented into holes drilled into rock outcrops or ledges in such a configuration that the station is referenced by a subsurface mark in a precise vertical register with the surface mark, two reference marks, similar to the surface mark accurately located by azimuth and horizontal distance in respect to the horizontal control station and not more than one hundred fifty feet distant and an azimuth mark which may be similar to the horizontal control station not less than one thousand feet distant, or optionally, an object not less than three thousand feet distant such as a church spire, water tank, radio or television transmitting antenna, by which azimuth mark subsequent surveys may be accurately oriented.

C. Horizontal control stations shall be established, if practicable, in proximity to road intersections, hill or mountain tops and similar locations as an aid in the field searches for the horizontal control stations.

#### Section 33-134. Tract located in more than one zone; description

If a tract of land to be defined by a single description extends from one into another of the coordinate zones established by this article, the position of all points on its boundaries may be referred to as either of the two zones, the zone which is used being specifically named in the description.

#### Section 33-135. Reliance of purchaser or mortgagee not required

Nothing contained in this article requires any purchaser or mortgagee to rely on any land description, any part of which depends exclusively on the Arizona coordinate system, 1983.

#### Section 33-136. Public lands survey descriptions; conflicts; control

If coordinates based on the Arizona coordinate system, 1983, are used to describe a tract of land which in the same document is also described by reference to a subdivision, line or corner of the United States public land surveys, the description by coordinates shall be construed as supplemental to the basic description of the subdivision, line or corner contained in the official field notes and plat filed of record, and in the event of a conflict the description by reference to the subdivision, line or corner of the United States public land surveys prevails over the description by coordinates.

#### Section 33-137. Recording, filing, publishing extensions and densifications of the ground marking system

A. Extensions and densifications of the ground marking system of the Arizona coordinate system, 1983, shall be executed in conformity with the standards and specifications of the federal geodetic control committee for first order, second order class I and second order class II surveys and computed on the North American datum, 1983.

B. The results of these surveys shall be published by a competent department of the federal government, such as the national geodetic survey, or a surveyor qualified to practice in this state, in which case the survey results shall bear a certification to the effect that the specifications of the federal geodetic control committee have been followed.

C. Extensions and densifications of the ground marking system by first order, second order class I or second order class II methods only shall be used. Such extensions and densifications shall be integrated with previously established horizontal control stations of equal or higher order to form a matrix or network no part of which shall have positional errors exceeding those specified for class II second order. The spacing intervals shall not exceed three miles.

D. The results of these surveys are public domain and shall be duly recorded in the office of the county recorder of the county where the horizontal control station is situated.

#### Section 33-138. Recording prerequisite

Coordinates based on the Arizona coordinate system, 1983, shall not be presented to be recorded in any public land records unless the recording document also contains the descriptions of not less than two horizontal control stations of first order, second order class I or second order class II positional accuracy which shall not exceed six miles from the nearest point or line of the land survey.

#### Section 33-204. Estates in expectancy; reversions; future estates; remainders

A. Estates in expectancy are divided into:

1. Reversions. A reversion is the residue of an estate left in a grantor or his heirs, or in the heirs of a testator, commencing in possession upon the determination of a particular estate granted or devised.

2. Future estates. A future estate is an estate limited to commence in possession at a future time, either without the intervention of a precedent estate or upon the determination, by lapse of time or otherwise, of a precedent estate created at the same time. A future estate dependent upon a precedent estate is a remainder.

#### Section 33-205. Vested future estates; contingent future estates

A. A future estate is vested when there is a person in being who would have immediate right to the possession of the lands upon the termination of the intermediate or precedent estate.

B. A future estate is contingent while the person to whom, or the event upon which it is limited to take effect, remains uncertain.

### Article 2 - Future Interests

#### Section 33-221. Estates in expectancy; alienability

A. A freehold estate or a chattel real may be created to commence at a future time, subject to the provisions of this chapter.

B. Estates in expectancy are descendable, devisable and alienable as estates in possession.

C. An estate of freehold or inheritance may be made to commence in the future by deed or conveyance in like manner as by will.

D. All estates in expectancy except those enumerated and defined in this chapter are abolished.

#### Section 33-222. Alternative future estates

Two or more future estates may be created to take effect in the alternative, so that if the first in order fails to vest, the next in succession shall be substituted for it and take effect.

#### Section 33-223. Time of creation of estates in expectancy

The time of creation of an estate in expectancy is the time of:

1. Delivery of the grant if the estate in expectancy is created by grant.

2. Death of the testator if the estate in expectancy is created by devise.

#### Section 33-224. Effect of conveyance purporting to create fee tail; effect of conveyance by tenant in tail

A. A devise, gift, grant or other conveyance which creates or transfers an estate which, at common law, would be an estate in fee tail, shall be deemed and have the effect of a conveyance in fee simple.

B. A devise, gift, grant or other conveyance made by a person holding an estate under a conveyance which at common law would have given such person an estate in fee tail shall have effect as though such person were holding a fee simple estate.

#### Section 33-225. Indefeasibility of expectant estates; exception

An estate in expectancy may not be defeated or barred by alienation or other act of the owner of the intermediate or precedent estate, nor by destruction of the precedent estate by disseizin, forfeiture, surrender, merger or otherwise, except in the manner provided or authorized in the creation of the expectant estate.

#### Section 33-226. Defeasibility of expectant estate by terms of grant or devise

A. An estate in expectancy may be defeated in any manner provided or authorized by the grant or devise by which the expectant estate was created.

B. An estate in expectancy thus defeasible is not, on that ground, void in its creation.

#### Section 33-227. Contingent remainder as conditional limitation

A. A remainder may be limited on a contingency which, if it should happen, will operate to abridge or determine the precedent estate. Such a remainder shall be construed a conditional limitation and shall have effect as such.

B. No future estate, otherwise valid, shall be void on the ground of the probability or improbability of the contingency upon which it is limited to take effect.

#### Section 33-228. Indestructibility of contingent remainders

A. A remainder valid in its creation is not defeated by determination of the precedent estate before the contingency occurs upon which the remainder is limited to take effect. If the contingency occurs after determination of the precedent estate, the remainder shall take effect as if the precedent estate had continued to the time when the contingency occurs.

B. The alienation of a particular estate upon which a remainder depends, whether the alienation is by deed or will or by the union of such particular estate with the inheritance by purchase or by descent, shall not operate to defeat, impair or in any way affect such remainder.

#### Section 33-231. Rule in Shelley's case abolished

When a remainder is limited to the heirs or heirs of the body of a person to whom a life estate in the same premises is given, the persons who, on the termination of the life estate, are the heirs or heirs of the body of the life tenant shall take as purchasers by virtue of the remainder so limited to them.

#### Section 33-233. Life estate in term of years

An estate for life may be created in an estate for a term of years and a remainder may be limited thereon.

#### Section 33-234. Time when remainder on life estate or term of years takes effect

When a remainder on an estate for life or on an estate for years is not limited upon a contingency defeating or avoiding the precedent estate, it shall take effect only on the death of the first taker or the expiration of the term of years.

#### Section 33-236. "Heir" and "issue" as words of limitation

When a remainder is limited to take effect upon the death of a person without heirs or heirs of his body, or without issue, the words "heirs" or "issue" shall mean heirs or issue living at the death of the person named as ancestor.

#### Section 33-237. Effect of posthumous children upon limitations

A. When a future estate is limited to heirs, issue or children, posthumous children shall take as if born before the death of the parent.

B. A future estate contingent upon the death of a person without heirs, issue or children is defeated by birth of a posthumous child of such person, capable of taking by descent.

#### Section 33-239. Use of accumulations for support and education of children

When rents and profits are directed to be accumulated for the benefit of an infant entitled to the estate in expectancy, and the infant is without other sufficient means of support and education, the superior court, upon application of the guardian of the infant, may direct that an appropriate amount of the rents and profits be applied to the maintenance and education of the infant.

#### Section 33-240. Ownership of rents and profits arising during suspension of power of alienation

When in consequence of a valid limitation of an estate in expectancy there is a suspension of the power of alienation, or ownership, during the continuance of which the rents and profits are undisposed of and no valid direction for their accumulation is given, the rents and profits belong to the person presumptively entitled to the next eventual estate.

### Article 3 - Perpetuities

#### Section 33-261. Rule against perpetuities

The common law rule known as the rule against perpetuities shall hereafter be applicable to all property of every kind and nature and estates and other interests therein, whether personal, real or mixed, legal or equitable by way of trust or otherwise.

When a tenant neglects or refuses to pay rent when due and in arrears for five days, or when a tenant violates any provision of the lease, the landlord or person to whom the rent is due, or the agent of the landlord or person to whom the rent is due, may reenter and take possession or, without formal demand or reentry, commence an action for recovery of possession of the premises.

B. The action shall be commenced, conducted and governed as provided for actions for forcible entry or detainer and shall be tried not less than five nor more than thirty days after its commencement.

B. The landlord may seize for rent any personal property of his tenant found on the premises, but the property of any other person, although found on the premises, shall not be liable therefor.

C. The landlord shall have a lien for rent upon crops grown or growing upon the leased premises, whether the rent is payable in money, articles of property or products of the premises, and also for the faithful performance of the terms of the lease, and the lien shall continue for a period of six months after expiration of the term of the lease.

Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the description of easements and rights-of-way for public service corporation, telecommunications corporation or cable television system purposes reserved or conveyed in a conveyance document or other instrument executed prior to September 15, 1982 is not void for lack of a sufficient description of the course or width of the easement if the servient estate which is subject to the easement or right-of-way is sufficiently described.

#### Section 33-404. Disclosure of beneficiary; recording; failure to disclose

A. Notwithstanding section 33-411, subsection D, every deed or conveyance of real property, or an interest in real property, located in this state which is executed after June 22, 1976 in which the grantee is described as a trustee or acts as a trustee shall disclose the names and addresses of the beneficiaries for whom the grantee holds title and shall identify the trust or other agreement under which the grantee is acting or refer by proper description to the document number or the docket and page of an instrument or other writing which is of public record in the county in which the property so conveyed is located in which such matters are disclosed.

B. Notwithstanding section 33-411, subsection D, every deed or conveyance of real property, or an interest in real property, located in this state which is executed after June 22, 1976 by a grantor who holds title to the property as a trustee, whether or not such capacity is identified on the document through which title was acquired, shall also disclose the names and addresses of the beneficiaries for whom the grantor held title to the property and shall identify the trust or other agreement under which the grantor is acting or refer by proper description to the document number or the docket and page of an instrument or other writing which is of public record in the county in which the property so conveyed is located in which such matters are disclosed.

Notwithstanding section 33-411, subsection D, a grantee who holds title as a trustee under a trust or other agreement which is subject to the disclosure requirements of this section and who receives actual knowledge after August 18, 1987 of a change in beneficiary, within thirty days after receiving such actual knowledge, shall record with the county recorder of the county in which the property is located a notice of the change. The recording and any subsequent recording of any change in any beneficiary shall identify the trust or other agreement under which the grantee holds title and shall include the legal description of the property and a list of the then current names and addresses of the beneficiaries.

D. Notwithstanding subsections A, B and C of this section, a trustee is not required to record a change of beneficiary if, upon the death of a beneficiary of a real property trust, the interests of the deceased beneficiary vest in the beneficiary's estate or in other beneficiaries identified in a previous recording. If the interest of the deceased beneficiary vests in a beneficiary not identified in a previous recording, the trustee shall comply with the recording requirements of this chapter within thirty days of receipt of both knowledge of the death and the name and address of the successor beneficiary or beneficiaries or within thirty days of the first distribution of income or principal to a successor beneficiary or beneficiaries, whichever occurs first.

#### Section 33-405. Beneficiary deeds; recording; definitions

A. A deed that conveys an interest in real property, including any debt secured by a lien on real property, to a grantee beneficiary designated by the owner and that expressly states that the deed is effective on the death of the owner transfers the interest to the designated grantee beneficiary effective on the death of the owner subject to all conveyances, assignments, contracts, mortgages, deeds of trust, liens, security pledges and other encumbrances made by the owner or to which the owner was subject during the owner's lifetime.

B. A beneficiary deed may designate multiple grantees who take title as joint tenants with right of survivorship, tenants in common, a husband and wife as community property or as community property with right of survivorship, or any other tenancy that is valid under the laws of this state.  Unless the beneficiary deed provides otherwise, the interest in real property conveyed by a beneficiary deed is the separate property of the named grantee beneficiary and is not community property.

C. A beneficiary deed may designate a successor grantee beneficiary. If the beneficiary deed designates a successor grantee beneficiary, the deed shall state the condition on which the interest of the successor grantee beneficiary would vest.  Unless the beneficiary deed provides otherwise, if there are no grantee beneficiaries named in the beneficiary deed who survive the owner, the beneficiary deed is void and section 14-2603 does not apply.

D. If real property is owned as joint tenants with the right of survivorship or as community property with the right of survivorship, a deed that conveys an interest in the real property to a grantee beneficiary designated by all of the then surviving owners and that expressly states that the deed is effective on the death of the last surviving owner transfers the interest to the designated grantee beneficiary effective on the death of the last surviving owner. If a beneficiary deed is executed by fewer than all of the owners of real property owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship or community property with right of survivorship, the beneficiary deed is valid if the last surviving owner is one of the persons who executes the beneficiary deed. If the last surviving owner did not execute the beneficiary deed, the transfer shall lapse and the deed is void. An estate in joint tenancy with right of survivorship or community property with right of survivorship is not affected by the execution of a beneficiary deed that is executed by fewer than all of the owners of the real property, and the rights of a surviving joint tenant with right of survivorship or a surviving spouse in community property with right of survivorship shall prevail over a grantee beneficiary named in a beneficiary deed.

E. A beneficiary deed is valid only if the deed is executed and recorded as provided by law in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the property is located before the death of the owner or the last surviving owner.  A beneficiary deed may be used to transfer an interest in real property to the trustee of a trust even if the trust is revocable.

F. A beneficiary deed may be revoked at any time by the owner or, if there is more than one owner, by any of the owners who executed the beneficiary deed.  To be effective, the revocation must be executed and recorded as provided by law in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the real property is located before the death of the owner who executes the revocation.  If the real property is owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship or community property with right of survivorship and if the revocation is not executed by all the owners, the revocation is not effective unless executed by the last surviving owner.

G. If an owner executes and records more than one beneficiary deed concerning the same real property, the last beneficiary deed that is recorded before the owner's death is the effective beneficiary deed.

H. This section does not prohibit other methods of conveying property that are permitted by law and that have the effect of postponing enjoyment of an interest in real property until the death of the owner.  This section does not invalidate any deed otherwise effective by law to convey title to the interests and estates provided in the deed that is not recorded until after the death of the owner.

I. The signature, consent or agreement of or notice to a grantee beneficiary of a beneficiary deed is not required for any purpose during the lifetime of the owner.

J. A beneficiary deed that is executed, acknowledged and recorded in accordance with this section is not revoked by the provisions of a will.

K. A beneficiary deed is sufficient if it complies with other applicable laws and if it is in substantially the following form:

Beneficiary Deed

I (we) _________________________ (owner) hereby convey to _______________ (grantee beneficiary) effective on my (our) death the following described real property:

(Legal description)

If a grantee beneficiary predeceases the owner, the conveyance to that grantee beneficiary shall either (choose one):

[] Become null and void.

[] Become part of the estate of the grantee beneficiary.

_________________________

(Signature of grantor(s))

(acknowledgment).

L. The instrument of revocation shall be sufficient if it complies with other applicable laws and is in substantially the following form:

Revocation of Beneficiary Deed

The undersigned hereby revokes the beneficiary deed recorded on ___________ (date), in docket or book __________ at page ________, or instrument number ____________, records of ________________ county, Arizona.

Dated: _______________________

______________________________

Signature

(acknowledgment).

M. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Beneficiary deed" means a deed authorized under this section.

2. "Owner" means any person who executes a beneficiary deed as provided in this section.

#### Section 33-406. Disclosure of transportation of water to property by motor vehicle or train; definition

A. Notwithstanding section 33-411, subsection D, a subdivider who sells a lot that was included in a plat approved by the legislative body of a city or town pursuant to an exemption authorized by section 9-463.01, subsection K or by the board of supervisors of a county pursuant to an exemption authorized by section 11-823, subsection B, paragraph 1 shall record with the plat a document that contains a legal description of the land that is subject to the subdivision plat and that contains a statement that the lots are served by a water supply that has been determined as inadequate and that the water must be hauled to the lot.

It shall not be necessary to record the judgment in full, but an abstract thereof by the clerk of the court under his hand and seal, stating the title of the court and of the action, the date of judgment, a description of the property and the name of the party to whom it is decreed, shall be a sufficient record of the judgment.

#### Section 33-415. Recording of master mortgages; including master mortgage provisions by reference in other mortgage

A. Any person may record in the office of the county recorder of any county master mortgages of real property. Master mortgages are not required to be acknowledged or proved or certified to be recorded or entitled to be recorded. Such mortgages shall have noted upon the face thereof that they are master mortgages.

B. The county recorder shall index and record master mortgages in the same manner as other mortgages are indexed and recorded and shall note on all indices and records thereof that they are master mortgages.

A. Every transfer of an interest in real property, other than in trust, or a trust deed subject to the provisions of chapter 6.1 of this title, made only as a security for the performance of another act, is a mortgage.

An assignment of a mortgage may be recorded in like manner as a mortgage, and the record is notice to all persons subsequently deriving title to the mortgage from the assignor.

#### Section 33-707. Acknowledgment of satisfaction; recording

If a mortgagee, trustee or person entitled to payment receives full satisfaction of a mortgage or deed of trust, he shall acknowledge satisfaction of the mortgage or deed of trust by delivering to the person making satisfaction or by recording a sufficient release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance of the deed of trust, which release, satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance shall contain the docket and page number or recording number of the mortgage or deed of trust. If a mortgagee, trustee or person entitled to payment receives an amount less than full satisfaction of a mortgage or deed of trust, but has agreed in writing to release the mortgage or deed of trust, the mortgagee, trustee or person shall acknowledge release of the mortgage or deed of trust by delivering to the person making payment of the agreed amount that is less than full satisfaction or by recording a sufficient release of the mortgage or release and reconveyance of the deed of trust, which release or release and reconveyance shall contain the docket and page number or recording number of the mortgage or deed of trust.  It shall not be necessary for the trustee to join in the acknowledgment or satisfaction, or in the release, satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance. The recorded release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance constitutes conclusive evidence of full or partial satisfaction and release of the mortgage or deed of trust in favor of purchasers and encumbrancers for value and without actual notice.

B. When a mortgage or deed of trust is satisfied by a release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance, except where the record of such deed of trust or mortgage has been destroyed or reduced to microfilm, the recorder shall record the release or satisfaction of the deed of trust or mortgage showing the book and page or recording number where the deed of trust or mortgage is recorded.

C. If the record of such mortgage or deed of trust has been destroyed and the record thereof reduced to microfilm, it shall be sufficient evidence of satisfaction of any such mortgage or deed of trust for the release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance to be recorded and indexed as such. The instrument shall sufficiently identify the mortgage or deed of trust by parties and by book and page or recording number of the official records.  Such instrument shall be treated as a release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance and recorded.

D. If the note secured by a mortgage or deed of trust has been lost or destroyed, the assignee, mortgagee or beneficiary shall, before acknowledging satisfaction, make an affidavit that he is the lawful owner of the note and that it has been paid, but cannot be produced for the reason that it has been lost or destroyed, and the affidavit shall be recorded. If the record of such mortgage or deed of trust has been destroyed and the record thereof reduced to microfilm, such affidavit shall be recorded and indexed as releases, satisfactions of mortgage and deeds of release and reconveyance are recorded and indexed and shall have the same force and effect as a release or satisfaction of a mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance as provided in subsection A of this section.

E. If a full release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance of deed of trust that, according to its terms, recites that it secures an obligation having a stated indebtedness not greater than one million dollars exclusive of interest, or a partial release or satisfaction of mortgage or partial deed of release and reconveyance of deed of trust that, according to its terms, recites that the payment required for the partial satisfaction or release does not exceed one million dollars exclusive of interest, or a release of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance of deed of trust by a mortgagee, trustee or person who has agreed in writing to release the mortgage or deed of trust in exchange for receipt of an amount less than full satisfaction of the mortgage or deed of trust and that, according to its terms, recites that it secures an obligation having a stated indebtedness not greater than one million dollars exclusive of interest, has not been executed and recorded pursuant to subsection A or C of this section within sixty days of full or partial satisfaction of the obligation secured by such mortgage or deed of trust, or within sixty days of the receipt by the mortgagee, trustee or other person of an amount less than full satisfaction if agreed in writing, a title insurer as defined in section 20-1562 may prepare, execute and record a full or partial release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of full or partial release and reconveyance of deed of trust. No earlier than sixty days after full or partial satisfaction and at least thirty days prior to the issuance and recording of any such release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance pursuant to this subsection, the title insurer shall mail by certified mail with postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the mortgagee of record or to the trustee and beneficiary of record and their respective successors in interest of record at their last known address shown of record and to any persons who according to the records of the title insurer received payment of the obligation at the address shown in such records, a notice of its intention to release the mortgage or deed of trust accompanied by a copy of the release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance to be recorded which shall set forth:

1. The name of the beneficiary or mortgagee or any successors in interest of record of such mortgagee or beneficiary and, if known, the name of any servicing agent.

2. The name of the original mortgagor or trustor.

3. The name of the current record owner of the property and if the release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance is a partial release, the name of the current record owner of the parcel described in the partial release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of partial release and reconveyance of deed of trust.

4. The recording reference to the deed of trust or mortgage.

5. The date and amount of payment, if known.

6. A statement that the title insurer has actual knowledge that the obligation secured by the mortgage or deed of trust has been paid in full, or if the release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance of deed of trust is a partial release, a statement that the title insurer has actual knowledge that the partial payment required for the release of the parcel described in the partial release or satisfaction has been paid or, if the release of mortgage or deed or release and reconveyance of deed of trust results from a mortgagee's, trustee's of other person's written agreement to accept an amount less than full satisfaction of the obligation, a statement that the title insurer has actual knowledge that the agreed upon payment has been made in full.

F. The release or satisfaction of mortgage or release and reconveyance of deed of trust may be executed by a duly appointed attorney-in-fact of the title insurer, but such delegation shall not relieve the title insurer from any liability pursuant to this section.

G. A full or partial release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of full or partial release and reconveyance of deed of trust issued pursuant to subsection E of this section shall be entitled to recordation and, when recorded, shall constitute a full or partial release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance of deed of trust issued pursuant to subsection A or C of this section.

H. Where an obligation secured by a deed of trust or mortgage was paid in full prior to September 21, 1991, and no release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance of deed of trust was issued and recorded by November 20, 1991, a release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release and reconveyance of deed of trust as provided for in subsection E of this section may be prepared and recorded without the notice prescribed by subsection E of this section.

I. A release or satisfaction of mortgage or a release and reconveyance of deed of trust by a title insurer under the provisions of subsection E of this section shall not constitute a defense nor release any person from compliance with subsections A through D of this section or from liability under section 33-712.

J. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, a title insurer preparing or recording the release and satisfaction of mortgage or the release and reconveyance of deed of trust pursuant to subsection E of this section shall be liable to any party for actual damage, including  attorney fees, which any person may sustain by reason of the issuance and recording of the release and satisfaction of mortgage or release and reconveyance of deed of trust.

K. The title insurer shall not record a release and satisfaction of mortgage or release and reconveyance of deed of trust if, prior to the expiration of the thirty day period specified in subsection E of this section, the title insurer receives a notice from the mortgagee, trustee, beneficiary, holder or servicing agent which states that the mortgage or deed of trust continues to secure an obligation, or in the case of a partial release or satisfaction of mortgage or deed of partial release and reconveyance of deed of trust, a notice that states that the partial payment required to release the parcel described in the partial release or satisfaction has not been paid.

L. The title insurer may charge a reasonable fee to the owner of the land or other person requesting a release and satisfaction of mortgage or release and reconveyance of deed of trust for services, including but not limited to search of title, document preparation and mailing services rendered, and may in addition collect official fees.

#### Section 33-708. Release by attorney in fact

The executor or administrator of a mortgagee or of the holder or owner of an indebtedness secured by a mortgage or deed of trust shall, if the indebtedness was paid to the decedent in his lifetime, acknowledge satisfaction thereof by delivering to such person a sufficient release, satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release of the mortgage or deed of trust or acknowledge satisfaction as provided in subsection C of section 33-707. If the executor or administrator, upon proof to him of the payment of the indebtedness to his decedent, does not, within thirty days, acknowledge satisfaction by delivering to the person owning the property a sufficient release, satisfaction of mortgage or deed of release, or acknowledge satisfaction as provided in subsection C of section 33-707, he shall personally forfeit to the party aggrieved one hundred dollars and be personally liable for the damages thereby sustained.

#### Section 33-715. Payoff demands; definitions

A. On the written demand of an entitled person or that person's authorized agent, a secured lender shall prepare and deliver a payoff demand statement to the person who has requested it within fourteen days after receipt of the demand.  Any written demand for a payoff demand statement prescribed in section 33-420.01 shall include a statement that the entitled person is acting as an agent of the borrower and that the line of credit is to be suspended.

B. The payoff demand statement shall provide the amounts required as of the date of preparation, include the information reasonably necessary to calculate the payoff amount on a per diem basis for a period of at least thirty days and include the following information:

1. The name and address of the person who or department that is to receive the payoff payment.

2. The name and address of the person who or department that is to receive the request to close the debt, line of credit or other obligation to pay.

3. The name and address of the person who or department that is to receive the request for release of lien.

C. The entitled person or that person's authorized agent may rely on a payoff demand statement for the purpose of establishing the amount necessary to pay the obligation in full and obtain a release of the mortgage or deed of trust that secures the obligation through and including the time set forth in the payoff demand statement.  The entitled person must submit the payoff funds, instructions to close the revolving line of credit and request for release of lien to the secured lender as directed by the secured lender on the payoff demand statement prepared in conjunction with subsection B of this section.

D. The entitled person or that person's authorized agent may rely on an amended payoff demand statement if the secured lender delivers that amended payoff demand statement to the entitled person or that person's authorized agent before the earlier of:

1. The transfer of title to the mortgaged or trust property or any portion of the property.

2. The recordation of a mortgage or deed of trust describing the mortgaged or trust property or any portion of the property.

E. For notes created or renegotiated after August 22, 2002, any sums that were due the secured lender and that were not included in the payoff demand statement or in any amended statement constitute an unsecured obligation of the obligor pursuant to the terms of the note and are recoverable by the secured lender pursuant to the terms of the note and as otherwise provided by law.

F. A secured lender who willfully fails to prepare and deliver a payoff demand statement for fourteen or more days after receipt of a written demand is liable to the entitled person for all damages sustained for failure to deliver the statement.  The secured lender is also liable to the entitled person for five hundred dollars whether or not actual damages are sustained. Each failure of the secured lender to prepare and deliver the payoff demand statement when required to do so pursuant to this section constitutes a separate cause of action. A judgment that awards an entitled person a forfeiture or damages, or both, for any failure to prepare and deliver a payoff demand statement bars recovery of any other damages or forfeiture for any other failure to prepare and deliver a statement with respect to the same obligation, if the other demand for the statement was made within six months before or after the demand was made that resulted in the award. For the purposes of this subsection, "willfully" means a failure to comply with this section without just cause or excuse.

G. If the secured lender has more than one branch, office or other place of business, the payoff statement demand shall be made to the branch or office address provided in the payment billing notice or payment book.  Unless the payoff demand statement provides otherwise, the statement is deemed to apply only to the unpaid balance of the single obligation that is named in the demand and that is secured by the mortgage or deed of trust that is payable at the address that is provided in the payment billing notice or payment book.

H. The demand for and preparation and delivery of a payoff demand statement pursuant to this section does not change any date or time period that is prescribed in the note or that is otherwise provided by law.

I. The secured lender may assess a fee of no more than thirty dollars for furnishing each payoff demand statement.  This is conclusively presumed to be reasonable.

J. For the purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Deliver" or "delivery" means depositing or causing to be deposited into the United States mail an envelope with postage prepaid that contains a copy of the documents to be delivered and that is addressed to the person whose name and address are provided in the payoff demand.  Delivery includes transmitting those documents by telefacsimile machine to the person.  Delivery includes transmitting those documents electronically pursuant to title 44, chapter 26 if the payoff demand specifically requests and authorizes that the documents be transmitted in electronic form.

2. "Entitled person" means the trustor or mortgagor of the mortgaged or trust property or any part of that property, any successor in interest to the trustor or mortgagor, any person with a lien or encumbrance of record on the mortgaged or trust property and an escrow agent that is licensed pursuant to title 6.

3. "Payoff demand" means a written demand for a payoff demand statement made by an entitled person or that person's authorized agent.

4. "Payoff demand statement" means a written statement that is prepared in response to a written demand made by an entitled person or that person's authorized agent that sets forth the amounts required by the secured lender to fully satisfy all of the obligations secured by the loan that is the subject of the demand.

5. "Secured lender" has the same meaning prescribed in section 33-420.01.

C.

All execution upon judgments for foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust upon real property shall comply with section 12-1566. Any sale of real property to satisfy a judgment under this section or section 33-814 shall be a credit on the judgment in the amount of either the fair market value of the real property or the sale price of the real property at sheriff's sale, whichever is greater, in accordance with section 12-1566.

C. If the debt for which the lien is held is not all due, as soon as enough of the property is sold to pay the amount due, with costs, the sale shall cease, and afterward as often as more becomes due for principal and interest, the court may, on motion, order more property sold. If the property cannot be sold in portions without injury to the parties, the whole may be ordered sold in the first instance and the entire debt and costs paid, allowing a rebate of interest where proper.

#### Section 33-726. Redemption of property by payment to officer directed under foreclosure judgment to sell the property

B. If there are other liens on the property sold, or other payments secured by the same mortgage, they shall be paid in their order, and if the money secured by any such lien is not yet due, a rebate of interest, to be ascertained by the court, shall be made by the holder, or his lien on such property will be postponed to those of a junior date, and if there are no other liens the balance shall be paid to the mortgagor. If redemption is not made and the mortgagor or his assigns refuse, after expiration of the time for redemption, to deliver possession of the foreclosed property, the court shall order a writ of possession issued placing the purchaser or his assigns in possession. All executions upon judgments for foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust upon real property shall comply with section 12-1566. Any sale of real property to satisfy a judgment under section 33-725 or 33-814 shall be a credit on the judgment in the amount of either the fair market value of the real property or the sale price of the real property at sheriff's sale, whichever is greater, in accordance with section 12-1566.

#### Section 33-728. Recording upon record that mortgage is foreclosed and judgment satisfied; effect

B. The balance due on a mortgage foreclosure judgment after sale of the mortgaged property shall constitute a lien against other property of the judgment debtor, general execution may be issued thereon, and the judgment may be otherwise satisfied out of other property of the judgment debtor, if the court determines, after sale upon special execution and upon written application and such notice to the judgment debtor as the court may require, that the sale price was less than the amount of the judgment because of diminution in the value of such real property while such property was in the ownership, possession, or control of the judgment debtor because of voluntary waste committed or permitted by the judgment debtor, not to exceed the amount of diminution in value as determined by such court.

2. "Contract" means a contract for conveyance of real property, a contract for deed, a contract to convey, an agreement for sale or any similar contract through which a seller has conveyed to a purchaser equitable title in property and under which the seller is obligated to convey to the purchaser the remainder of the seller's title in the property, whether legal or equitable, on payment in full of all monies due under the contract. This article does not apply to purchase contracts and receipts, escrow instructions or similar executory contracts which are intended to control the rights and obligations of the parties to executory contracts pending the closing of a sale or purchase transaction.

3. "Monies due under the contract" means:

(a) Any principal and interest payments which are currently due and payable to the seller.

(b) Any principal and interest payments which are currently due and payable to other persons who hold existing liens and encumbrances on the property, the unpaid principal portion of which constitutes a portion of the purchase price, as stated in the contract, if the principal and interest payments were paid by the seller pursuant to the terms of the contract and to protect his interest in the property.

(c) Any delinquent taxes and assessments, including interest and penalty, due and payable to any governmental entity authorized to impose liens on the property which are the purchaser's obligations under the contract, if the taxes and assessments were paid by the seller pursuant to the terms of the contract and to protect his interest in the property.

#### Section 33-742. Forfeiture of interest of purchaser in default under contract

A. If a purchaser is in default by failing to pay monies due under the contract, a seller may, after expiration of the applicable period stated in subsection D of this section and after serving the notice of election to forfeit stated in section 33-743, complete the forfeiture of the purchaser's interest in the property in the manner provided by section 33-744 or 33-745. If the contract provides that the seller may elect to accelerate the principal balance due under the contract to the seller on the purchaser's failure to pay the monies due, the seller may accelerate the principal balance due to the seller at any time after the purchaser has failed to pay the monies due under the contract. The acceleration may occur before or after the expiration of the applicable period stated in subsection D of this section and without serving the notice of election to forfeit stated in section 33-743. If the seller elects to accelerate the principal balance due to the seller, the seller may only foreclose the contract as a mortgage in the manner provided by section 33-748. If a purchaser is in default under the contract for reasons other than failing to pay monies due under the contract, the seller may only foreclose the contract as a mortgage in the manner provided by section 33-748.

B. The interest of a purchaser in any personal property included in a contract is subject to forfeiture or foreclosure in the same manner as the real property, except that forfeiture or foreclosure does not affect or impair the rights of a holder of a security interest whose interest in the personal property is not subordinate to that of the seller.

C. If a contract provides that time is of the essence, a waiver of that provision occurs only if the seller has accepted monies due under the contract in an amount which is less than the total monies due under the contract at the time of the acceptance. Receipt of any monies due under the contract by an account servicing agency does not constitute acceptance by the seller. A seller's delay in exercising any remedy granted either by the contract or by law does not constitute a waiver of a time is of the essence provision. If the time of the essence provision has been waived, the seller may reinstate the provision by serving a written notice on the purchaser and the account servicing agent, if one has been appointed, requiring strict performance of the purchaser's obligations to pay monies due under the contract. The notice shall be served, either by delivery in person or deposit in the United States mail, first class, postage prepaid, at least twenty days prior to the date on which the seller will require the purchaser to pay the monies due under the contract. A copy of the notice need not be recorded in the county in which the real property is located or served on any person other than the purchaser and the account servicing agent, if one has been appointed.

D. Forfeiture of the interest of a purchaser in the property for failure to pay monies due under the contract may be enforced only after expiration of the following periods after the date such monies were due:

1. If there has been paid less than twenty per cent of the purchase price, thirty days.

2. If there has been paid twenty per cent, or more, but less than thirty per cent of the purchase price, sixty days.

3. If there has been paid thirty per cent, or more, but less than fifty per cent of the purchase price, one hundred and twenty days.

4. If there has been paid fifty per cent, or more, of the purchase price, nine months.

E. For the purpose of computing the percentage of the purchase price paid under subsection D of this section, the total of only the following constitutes payments on the purchase price:

1. Down payments paid to the seller.

2. Principal payments paid to the seller on the contract.

3. Principal payments paid to other persons who hold liens or encumbrances on the property, the principal portion of which constitutes a portion of the purchase price, as stated under the contract.

#### Section 33-743. Notice of election to forfeit and reinstatement of purchaser's interest

A. If the seller elects to forfeit the purchaser's interest in the property, the seller and the account servicing agent, if one has been appointed, shall record a notice of election to forfeit with the county recorder of the county in which the real property is located. A notice of election to forfeit is ineffective unless recorded after expiration of the applicable period prescribed in section 33-742, subsection D. A copy of the notice shall be served, either by delivery in person or by deposit in the United States mail, first class, postage prepaid, at least twenty days prior to the effective date of the forfeiture, on the purchaser and on persons who, at the time of recordation of the notice of election to forfeit, appear on the records of the county recorder of the county in which the real property is located as having an interest in or a lien or encumbrance on the property, the priority of which is subordinate to that of the seller, or who have requested a copy of such notice in the manner provided by section 33-746. If mailed, the notice shall be addressed to the last mailing address filed in writing with the seller or with the account servicing agent or as designated on the request for copy of notice of election to forfeit. If no address has been filed with the seller or the account servicing agent, a copy of the notice may be mailed in care of the person to whom any recorded document evidencing an interest in or a lien or encumbrance on the property was directed to be mailed at the time of its recording.

B. The notice of election to forfeit shall be substantially in the following form:

C. A person need not be served with a copy of the notice of election to forfeit unless the person, at the time of recordation of the notice, appeared on the records of the county recorder of the county in which the real property is located as having an interest in or a lien or encumbrance on the property, the priority of which is subordinate to that of the seller, or requested a copy of the notice in the manner provided for in section 33-746.

D. Failure to serve a copy of the notice of election to forfeit on each person as stated in subsection A of this section does not invalidate the service of the notice of election to forfeit as to persons served but extends the effective date of the forfeiture until at least twenty days after the persons not previously served have been served with a copy of the notice.

E. A purchaser who has failed to pay monies due under the contract or any other person may, at any time prior to expiration of the period provided for in the notice of election to forfeit, avoid the forfeiture by complying with the terms of the notice.

F. If the purchaser or any other person timely complies with the terms of the notice of election to forfeit, the seller or the account servicing agent shall record a notice of reinstatement with the county recorder of the county in which the real property is located. The notice of reinstatement shall be substantially in the following form:

"Notice of Reinstatement

#### Section 33-744. Completion of forfeiture by judicial process

At any time after expiration of the period provided for in the notice of election to forfeit, the seller may complete the forfeiture of the interest of the purchaser and persons having an interest in or a lien or encumbrance on the property, the priority of which is subordinate to that of the seller, by filing an action in the superior court in the county in which the real property is located to declare that the interest of the persons has been forfeited and to quiet title to the property in the seller. In the action, the seller shall name as defendants the purchaser and each person who, at the expiration of the period provided for in the notice of election to forfeit, had an interest in or a lien or encumbrance on the property, the priority of which was subordinate to that of the seller.

#### Section 33-745. Completion of forfeiture by notice

A. If an account servicing agent has been appointed to hold documents and collect monies due under the contract and the agent has recorded and served the notice of election to forfeit, as provided in section 33-743, the seller and account servicing agent may complete the forfeiture of the interest of the purchaser and persons having an interest in or a lien or encumbrance on the property, the priority of which is subordinate to that of the seller, by recordation of an affidavit of completion of forfeiture with the county recorder of the county in which the real property is located. The county recorder shall index the affidavit of completion of forfeiture under the classification in which conveyances of real property are indexed.

B. Recordation of an affidavit of completion of forfeiture terminates without right of redemption all right, title and interest of the purchaser and all persons having an interest in or a lien or encumbrance on the property, the priority of which is subordinate to that of the seller, including the interest of any persons acquiring an interest in or a lien or encumbrance on the property subsequent to recordation of the notice of election to forfeit. On recordation of the affidavit, the property reverts to the seller clear of all interests, liens and encumbrances, the priority of which was subordinate to that the seller. The recordation of the affidavit of completion of forfeiture also raises the presumption of compliance with all requirements of this article and constitutes conclusive evidence of the meeting of the requirements in favor of purchasers or encumbrancers for value and without actual notice.

C. The affidavit of completion of forfeiture shall be substantially in the following form:

"Affidavit of Completion of Forfeiture

The undersigned, being duly sworn, deposes and says that the purchaser under that certain contract, by and between _______________, as seller, and _______________, as purchaser, dated _______________, 19____, and recorded (if recorded) on _______________, 19____, in docket __________, at page __________, records of _______________ county, Arizona, covering real property described as follows:

If a purchaser is in default under the contract for reasons other than failing to pay amounts due under the contract, the seller may only foreclose the contract as a mortgage in the manner provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages upon real property.

B. If an action to foreclose a contract has been filed, a forfeiture, by judicial process as provided by section 33-744 or by notice as provided by section 33-745, shall not thereafter be completed unless the foreclosure action is first dismissed and a notice of election to forfeit is served in the manner and on the persons provided for in section 33-743.

#### Section 33-805. Deed of trust as security

Deeds of trust may be executed as security for the performance of a contract or contracts. Except with respect to chapter 6 of this title, statutes of this state which refer to mortgages as security instruments are deemed to also include deeds of trust, unless the context otherwise requires.

#### Section 33-806. Transfers in trust of real property; uses

A. Transfers of trust property may be made to secure the performance of a contract or contracts of the trustor or any other person.  An interest in the trust property acquired by the trustor subsequent to the execution of the trust deed shall inure to the trustee as security for the contract or contracts for which the trust property is conveyed as if the interest or claim had been acquired before execution of the trust deed.

B. The trustee or beneficiary shall have a right to maintain an action against any person, including the trustor, for a claim for relief where damage or injury occurs or may occur to the trust property or interests therein, including but not limited to actions for damages or to prevent:

1. Physical abuse to or destruction of the trust property, or any portion thereof.

2. Waste.

3. Impairment of the security provided by the trust deed. In any such action the trustee or beneficiary, or both, shall also be entitled to recover costs and reasonable attorney's fees and shall be entitled to all remedies available. Recovery of damages under this section shall be limited to damages or injuries incurred during the time the trustor is in possession or control of the trust property. The provisions of section 33-814 shall in no manner restrict or limit the provisions of this section.

#### Section 33-806.01. Trustor's right to transfer; transfer fee limit; interest rate increase limit

A. Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent or limit the right of a trustor to transfer his interest in the trust property, or authorize a beneficiary or trustee to arbitrarily withhold his consent to a transfer by the trustor of his interest in the trust property.

B. When a trustor transfers his interest in the trust property, no beneficiary or trustee shall charge a fee on the transfer of more than one hundred dollars or one per cent of the balance due on the obligation secured by the trust deed, whichever is greater.

C. When a trustor transfers his interest in the trust property, no beneficiary or trustee shall increase the interest rate on the obligation secured by such trust deed unless the transferring trustor is released from all liability thereon and in no event shall the amount of such increase exceed one-half of one percent per annum more than the interest rate paid by the transferring trustor.

D. This section shall be applicable only to trust property of two and one-half acres or less which is not used for commercial purposes and which is limited to and utilized for dwelling units, not to exceed four single-family units.

#### Section 33-807. Sale of trust property; power of trustee; foreclosure of trust deed

A. By virtue of his position, a power of sale is conferred upon the trustee of a trust deed under which the trust property may be sold, in the manner provided in this chapter, after a breach or default in performance of the contract or contracts, for which the trust property is conveyed as security, or a breach or default of the trust deed. At the option of the beneficiary, a trust deed may be foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property in which event chapter 6 of this title governs the proceedings. The beneficiary or trustee shall constitute the proper and complete party plaintiff in any action to foreclose a deed of trust. The power of sale may be exercised by the trustee without express provision therefor in the trust deed.

B. The trustee or beneficiary may file and maintain an action to foreclose a deed of trust at any time before the trust property has been sold under the power of sale. A sale of trust property under the power of sale shall not be held after an action to foreclose the deed of trust has been filed unless the foreclosure action has been dismissed.

C. The trustee or beneficiary may file an action for the appointment of a receiver according to sections 12-1241 and 33-702. The right to appointment of a receiver shall be independent of and may precede the exercise of any other right or remedy.

D. The power of sale of trust property conferred upon the trustee shall not be exercised before the ninety-first day after the date of the recording of the notice of the sale.  The sale shall not be set for a Saturday or legal holiday.  The trustee may schedule more than one sale for the same date, time and place.

E. The trustee need only be joined as a party in legal actions pertaining to a breach of the trustee's obligation under this chapter or under the deed of trust. Any order of the court entered against the beneficiary is binding upon the trustee with respect to any actions that the trustee is authorized to take by the trust deed or by this chapter. If the trustee is joined as a party in any other action, the trustee is entitled to be immediately dismissed and to recover costs and reasonable attorney fees from the person joining the trustee.

2. To each person who, at the time of recording of the notice of sale, appears on the records of the county recorder in the county in which any part of the trust property is situated to have an interest in any of the trust property.  The copy of the notice sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be addressed to the person whose interest appears of record at the address set forth in the document.  If no address for the person is set forth in the document, the copy of the notice may be addressed in care of the person to whom the recorded document evidencing such interest was directed to be mailed at the time of its recording or to any other address of the person known or ascertained by the trustee.  If the interest that appears on the records of the county recorder is a deed of trust, a copy of the notice only needs to be mailed to the beneficiary under the deed of trust.  If any person having an interest of record or the trustor, or any person who has recorded a request for notice, desires to change the address to which notice shall be mailed, the change shall be accomplished by a request as provided under this section.

D. No request for a copy of a notice recorded pursuant to this section, nor any statement or allegation in any request, nor any record of request, shall affect the title to the trust property or be deemed notice to any person that a person requesting a copy of notice of sale has or claims any interest in, or claim upon, the trust property.

E. At any time that the trust deed is subject to reinstatement pursuant to section 33-813, but not sooner than thirty days after recordation of the notice of trustee's sale, the trustee shall upon receipt of a written request, provide, if actually known to the trustee, the following information relating to the trustee's sale and the trust property:

G. In providing information pursuant to subsections E and F of this section, the trustee, without obligation or liability for the accuracy or completeness of the information, may respond to oral requests, respond orally or in writing or provide additional information not required by such subsections.  With respect to property that is the subject of a trustee's sale, the beneficiary of such deed of trust or the holder of any prior lien may, but shall not be required to, provide information concerning such deed of trust or any prior lien that is not required by subsection E or F of this section and may charge a reasonable fee for providing the information.

#### Section 33-810. Sale by public auction; postponement of sale

A. On the date and at the time and place designated in the notice of sale, the trustee shall offer to sell the trust property at public auction for cash to the highest bidder.  The trustee may schedule more than one sale for the same date, time and place.  The attorney or agent for the trustee may conduct the sale and act at such sale as the auctioneer for the trustee.  Any person, including the trustee or beneficiary, may bid at the sale.  Only the beneficiary may make a credit bid in lieu of cash at sale.  The trustee shall require every bidder except the beneficiary to provide a ten thousand dollar deposit in any form that is satisfactory to the trustee as a condition of entering a bid.  The trustee or auctioneer may control the means and manner of the auction.  Every bid shall be deemed an irrevocable offer until the sale is completed, except that a subsequent bid by the same bidder for a higher amount shall cancel that bidder's lower bid.  To determine the highest price bid, the trustor or beneficiary present at the sale may recommend the manner in which the known lots, parcels or divisions of the trust property described in the notice of sale be sold.  The trustee shall conditionally sell the trust property under each recommendation, and, in addition, shall conditionally sell the trust property as a whole.  The trustee shall determine which conditional sale or sales result in the highest total price bid for all of the trust property.  The trustee shall return deposits to all but the bidder or bidders whose bid or bids result in the highest bid price. The sale shall be completed on payment by the purchaser of the price bid in a form satisfactory to the trustee.  The subsequent execution, delivery and recordation of the trustee's deed as prescribed by section 33-811 are ministerial acts.  If the trustee's deed is recorded in the county in which the trust property is located within fifteen business days after the date of the sale, the trustee's sale is deemed perfected at the appointed date and time of the trustee's sale.  If the highest price bid at a completed sale is less than the amount of that bidder's deposit, the amount of the deposit in excess of the bid price shall be refunded by the trustee at the time of delivery of the trustee's deed.

B. The person conducting the sale may postpone or continue the sale from time to time or change the place of the sale to any other location authorized pursuant to this chapter by giving notice of the new date, time and place by public declaration at the time and place last appointed for the sale.  Any new sale date shall be a fixed date within ninety calendar days of the date of the declaration.  After a sale has been postponed or continued, the trustee, on request, shall make available the date and time of the next scheduled sale and, if the location of the sale has been changed, the new location of the sale until the sale has been conducted or canceled and providing this information shall be without obligation or liability for the accuracy or completeness of the information.  No other notice of the postponed, continued or relocated sale is required except as provided in subsection C of this section.

C. A sale shall not be complete if the sale as held is contrary to or in violation of any federal statute in effect because of an unknown or undisclosed bankruptcy.  A sale so held shall be deemed to be continued to a date, time and place announced by the trustee at the sale and shall comply with subsection B of this section or, if not announced, shall be continued to the same place and at the same time twenty-eight days later, unless the twenty-eighth day falls on a Saturday or legal holiday, in which event it shall be continued to the first business day thereafter.  In the event a sale is continued because of an unknown or undisclosed bankruptcy, the trustee shall notify by registered or certified mail, with postage prepaid, all bidders who provide their names, addresses and telephone numbers in writing to the party conducting the sale of the continuation of the sale.

D. A sale is postponed by operation of law to the next business day at the same scheduled time and place if an act of force majeure prevents access to the sale location for the conduct of the sale.

 

#### Section 33-811. Payment of bid; trustee's deed

A. The highest bidder at the sale, other than the beneficiary to the extent of the credit bid, shall pay the price bid by no later than 5:00 p.m. mountain standard time of the following day, other than a Saturday or legal holiday.  If the highest bidder fails to pay the amount bid for the property struck off to the bidder at the sale, the trustee, in the trustee's sole discretion, shall either continue the sale to reopen bidding or immediately offer the trust property to the second highest bidder who may purchase the trust property at that bidder's bid price. The deposit of the highest bidder who fails to pay the amount bid shall be forfeited and shall be treated as additional sale proceeds to be applied in accordance with section 33-812, subsection A. If the second highest bidder does not pay that bidder's bid price by 5:00 p.m. mountain standard time of the next day excluding Saturdays and legal holidays after the property has been offered to that bidder by the trustee, the trustee shall either continue the sale to reopen bidding or offer the trust property to each of the prior bidders on successive days excluding Saturdays and legal holidays in order of their highest bid, until a bid price is paid, or if there is no other bidder, the sale shall be deemed to be continued to a time and place designated by the trustee, or if not designated, the sale shall be continued to the same place and at the same time twenty-eight days after the last scheduled sale date. If the twenty-eighth day is a Saturday or legal holiday, the sale shall be continued to the next business day. If the sale is continued, the trustee shall provide notice of the continuation of the sale by registered or certified mail, with postage prepaid, to all bidders who provide their names, addresses and telephone numbers in writing to the party conducting the sale. In addition to the forfeit of deposit, a highest bidder who fails to pay the amount bid by that bidder is liable to any person who suffers loss or expenses as a result, including attorney fees. In any subsequent sale of trust property, the trustee may refuse to accept any bid of that person.  In any sale that is continued pursuant to this subsection, the trustee shall reject the bid from any previous bidder who elected not to pay that bidder's bid price.

B. The price bid shall be paid at the office of the trustee or the trustee's agent, or any other reasonable place designated by the trustee.  The payment of the bid price may be made at a later time if agreed upon in writing by the trustee.  Within seven business days after receipt of payment by the trustee or the trustee's agent, made in a form that is satisfactory to the trustee, the trustee shall execute and submit the trustee's deed to the county recorder for recording and, upon request, shall provide an unrecorded copy of the signed trustee's deed to the purchaser.  The recording of the trustee's deed upon sale shall constitute delivery of the deed to the purchaser.  The trustee is not liable for any damages resulting from the failure to record the trustee's deed upon sale after physical delivery of the deed to the purchaser.  The trustee's deed shall raise the presumption of compliance with the requirements of the deed of trust and this chapter relating to the exercise of the power of sale and the sale of the trust property, including recording, mailing, publishing and posting of notice of sale and the conduct of the sale. A trustee's deed shall constitute conclusive evidence of the meeting of those requirements in favor of purchasers or encumbrancers for value and without actual notice.  Knowledge of the trustee shall not be imputed to the beneficiary.

C. The trustor, its successors or assigns, and all persons to whom the trustee mails a notice of a sale under a trust deed pursuant to section 33-809 shall waive all defenses and objections to the sale not raised in an action that results in the issuance of a court order granting relief pursuant to rule 65, Arizona rules of civil procedure, entered before 5:00 p.m. mountain standard time on the last business day before the scheduled date of the sale. A copy of the order, the application for the order and the complaint shall be delivered to the trustee within twenty-four hours after entering the order.

D. A sale is not complete if the sale violates subsection C of this section because of an undisclosed order entered by the court within the time provided for in subsection C of this section.  A sale held in violation of subsection C of this section shall be continued to a date, time and place announced by the trustee at the sale and shall comply with section 33-810, subsection B.  If not announced, the sale shall be continued to the same place and at the same time twenty-eight days later.  If the twenty-eighth day falls on a Saturday or legal holiday, the sale shall be continued to the next business day.  If the sale is continued because of an unknown or undisclosed order as provided in this subsection, the trustee shall notify by registered or certified mail, with postage prepaid, all bidders who provide names, addresses and telephone numbers in writing to the party conducting the sale of the continuation of the sale.

E. The trustee's deed shall operate to convey to the purchaser the title, interest and claim of the trustee, the trustor, the beneficiary, their respective successors in interest and all persons claiming the trust property sold by or through them, including all interest or claim in the trust property acquired subsequent to the recording of the deed of trust and prior to delivery of the trustee's deed. That conveyance shall be absolute without right of redemption and clear of all liens, claims or interests that have a priority subordinate to the deed of trust and shall be subject to all liens, claims or interests that have a priority senior to the deed of trust.

F. On completion of the sale and conveyance of the trustee's deed to the purchaser, the trustee shall notify the beneficiary of the beneficiary's obligations as prescribed by section 11-1133.  The trustee shall provide notice to the beneficiary on or before the date of the trustee's sale.

 

#### Section 33-812. Disposition of proceeds of sale

A. The trustee shall apply the proceeds of the trustee's sale in the following order of priority:

1. To the costs and expenses of exercising the power of sale and the sale, including the payment of the trustee's fees and reasonable attorney fees actually incurred.

2. To the payment of the contract or contracts secured by the trust deed.

3. To the payment of all other obligations provided in or secured by the trust deed and actually paid by the beneficiary before the trustee's sale.

4. To any condominium association or planned community association as defined in chapter 9 or 16 of this title that had a subordinate lien as provided by law, even if the trustee intends to deposit the balance pursuant to subsection C of this section.  The trustee may pay an association's lien on receipt of a written claim and shall be discharged from any liability for any payment made in good faith.  The trustee may inquire as to the existence of a lien if there is a recorded declaration on the property without regard to whether a lien has been recorded.  Any person who is an applicant or respondent pursuant to subsection H of this section may require the condominium association or planned community association to prove its entitlement to any funds received from the trustee.  An association that demonstrates that the amount it received from the trustee was proper in all material respects is entitled to an award of its reasonable attorney fees and court costs against the applicant or respondent who contested the payment.  If the applicant or respondent against whom the association's award is entered is entitled to excess proceeds of the sale, the award of attorney fees and costs shall be payable from those excess proceeds.

5. To the junior lienholders or encumbrancers in order of their priority as they existed at the time of the sale.  After payment in full of all sums due to all junior lienholders and encumbrancers as of the date of the sale and excluding any postsale attorney fees, payment shall be made to the trustor, except that if the trustor has sold or transferred the property to another owner before the trustee's sale, payment shall be made to the person who is the owner of record at the time of the trustee's sale.

B. After application of the proceeds pursuant to subsection A, paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of this section, if there are additional proceeds to be distributed, the trustee, within fifteen days of the completion of the trustee's sale, shall mail by first class mail and by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, to all known addresses a notice of any excess proceeds to the trustor as of the date of the recording of the notice of sale. The trustee may deduct the costs of mailing the notice of excess proceeds from the additional proceeds.

C. In the trustee's discretion and instead of any one or more of the applications specified in subsection A of this section, the trustee may elect to deposit the balance of the proceeds with the county treasurer in the county in which the sale took place pending an order of the superior court in the county.  On deposit of the balance of the monies and after complying with subsection D of this section, the trustee shall be discharged from all responsibility for acts performed in good faith according to this chapter. The county treasurer shall reject any deposit that does not comply with subsection D of this section.

D. If the trustee elects to deposit the balance of the sale proceeds as prescribed by subsection C of this section, the trustee as plaintiff shall commence a civil action in the superior court in the county in which the sale occurred.  The action shall name the applicable county treasurer as the defendant, but the county treasurer has no obligation to respond to the complaint or appear in the action.  The trustee shall mail by certified or registered mail, with postage prepaid, a conformed copy of the complaint that displays the filing stamp of the court clerk to the county treasurer and all persons, other than the beneficiary, who are entitled to notice pursuant to section 33-809 and to any other person known by the trustee to have an interest of record in the property at the time of the sale.  The conformed copy shall be mailed to all known addresses for those persons who are required to receive notice pursuant to this subsection.  The trustee shall incorporate in or attach to the complaint:

1. A copy of any one of the following:

(a) The trustee sale guarantee and all amendments or endorsements obtained by the trustee.

(b) The title search used by the trustee in connection with the trustee's sale of the subject property and all amendments or endorsements obtained by the trustee.

(c) A detailed description of the liens and encumbrances used by the trustee in connection with the trustee's sale of the property.

2. A copy of the list of the persons and each of the known addresses to which the complaint will be mailed.

3. A detailed description of any disbursements made by the trustee pursuant to this section.

4. A narrative description of the liens and encumbrances as shown in the trustee's sale guarantee, title report or detailed description, including an analysis of the apparent priority of potential claimants.  The trustee shall not be liable for any error in the narrative description or analysis.

E. The trustee may withhold from the proceeds of the sale a reasonable trustee's fee and reasonable attorney fees actually incurred and the costs of filing the complaint, depositing the proceeds and mailing the notices.

F. Upon filing the complaint and filing the subsequent certificate of mailing for the complaint with the certified mailing receipts of the addressees, the trustee as plaintiff is discharged without prejudice from the proceedings.

G. Any person with a recorded or other legal interest in the property at the time of the sale may apply for the release of the proceeds by filing an application for distribution in the civil action that was filed by the trustee pursuant to subsection D of this section.  The applicant shall mail postage prepaid by any form of mail that requires a signed and returned receipt a copy of the application to the county treasurer and all persons at each of the addresses named on the list of persons that is incorporated in or attached to the complaint and to any other address of the persons that is known to or ascertained by the applicant or the applicant's agent.  The mailing of the application to each interested party shall occur within three business days after the filing of the original application with the court. On return of the signed receipt or the undelivered or unclaimed original envelope, the applicant shall file with the court an affidavit that states that the application was mailed to the person and that the application was either:

1. Received, as evidenced by the receipt.  The applicant shall attach to the affidavit a copy of the receipt.

2. Not received, as evidenced by the returned envelope.  The applicant shall attach to the affidavit a copy of the original unopened and undelivered or unclaimed returned envelope.  If the returned envelope was marked with a new forwarding address, within ten business days after receipt of the original returned envelope the applicant shall:

(a) Send by certified mail a copy of the application to the new forwarding address.

(b) File a second affidavit of mailing with the court.

(c) Mail a copy of the second affidavit to all parties indicating that the application was mailed to the forwarding address.

(d) Continue service of the application pursuant to this paragraph until the original, unopened and undelivered envelope is returned without any forwarding address.

H. When mailing to all known addresses of a business or financial institution with an interest of record in the property, the trustee or applicant shall only be required to mail to the primary address of the business or financial institution as recorded with the corporation commission.

I. Any person who receives the application or who claims a right to the proceeds may file a response to the application within forty-five days of the latest mailing of the application.  The person filing a response shall mail a copy of the response to each applicant.  Within ten calendar days from the date the response is mailed, an applicant may file with the clerk and mail to each respondent a reply to the response.  On expiration of the time for filing a reply, an applicant shall provide the court with postage prepaid business envelopes that are addressed to all persons who are entitled to receive copies of the complaint pursuant to subsection D of this section. If an association with a claim is not paid by the trustee pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 4 of this section and is required to file an application or response pursuant to this subsection in order to recover proceeds, the association may request from the excess proceeds of the sale an award of its reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred.

J. Except as provided in subsection L of this section, the court shall issue an order to the county treasurer to release the proceeds deposited with the county treasurer to the party entitled to receive them after applying the priorities prescribed by subsection A of this section. On notice to all persons who have received a copy of the complaint or who have filed a responsive pleading, the court may, and if there are competing claims to the proceeds, the court shall, hold a hearing to determine entitlement to the proceeds.  Every applicant or respondent shall acknowledge the existence of any apparent lien, encumbrance or interest that could have priority over the applicant or respondent.  If the court finds that a person other than an applicant or respondent has a superior right to receive the proceeds, the court shall not issue an order on the proceeds until one hundred eighty days from the date the complaint was filed.  At any time before the expiration of the one hundred eighty day period, an applicant or respondent may move for a hearing to determine whether the claimed superior right is valid or enforceable and whether the claim is entitled to receive priority over the claim of the applicant or respondent. The motion shall set forth the specific facts and evidence that support the applicant's or respondent's position and shall be mailed to all persons who have received a copy of the complaint or filed a responsive pleading.  If a response is not filed within the one hundred eighty day period by the person found by the court to have a superior right to receive the proceeds, the court shall enter an order in favor of any applicant or respondent entitled to the proceeds.  On release of the proceeds, the county treasurer may assess and deduct from the proceeds a reasonable fee not to exceed one hundred dollars for the treasurer's costs associated with the civil action.

K. Within ninety days after completion of the sale, the trustee shall apply the proceeds of the sale pursuant to subsection A of this section or shall deposit the proceeds with the treasurer pursuant to subsection C of this section.  If the trustee fails to comply with this subsection, the trustee forfeits any entitlement to the fees and costs prescribed in subsection E of this section and shall pay interest at the rate provided for judgments pursuant to section 44-1201 from the date of completion of the sale until the trustee complies with this subsection.  Any person with a recorded or other legal interest in the property at the time of the sale may commence a civil action against the trustee for the trustee's failure to comply with this subsection. The court may award the prevailing party its reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred in that civil action.

L. Excess proceeds deposited with the county treasurer pursuant to subsection C of this section are presumed abandoned if the monies remain with the treasurer for at least two years from the date of deposit and there is no pending application for distribution.

M. Excess proceeds that are fifty dollars or less and that are presumed abandoned under this section shall be transferred to the county general fund.  No further application for distribution by any applicant or claim by the department of revenue may be made on these monies.

N. For all excess proceeds that are greater than fifty dollars and that are presumed abandoned under this section, the county treasurer shall submit a report to the department of revenue pursuant to section 44-307.  The county treasurer may assess and deduct from the proceeds a reasonable fee of not more than fifty dollars for the treasurer's costs associated with reporting each deposit.

O. The county treasurer shall be discharged from all claims and responsibility for acts performed in good faith pursuant to this chapter after remitting the presumed abandoned excess proceeds to the department of revenue pursuant to section 44-308.

P. A claimant may enter into an agreement with a third party to pay for the recovery of or for assistance in the recovery of excess proceeds on deposit with the county treasurer.  The agreement shall be in writing, signed by the claimant, and the claimant's signature shall be acknowledged by a notary public or other person authorized to accept an acknowledgment pursuant to section 33-511. Any agreement entered into before the expiration of thirty days after the date the trustee's sale was held, but not including the date of the sale, is void and unenforceable.  Any fee or payment provided for in an agreement shall be reasonable.  The fee or payment shall be presumed to be unreasonable and the obligation to pay the fee or payment is unenforceable if the fee or payment agreed on exceeds two thousand five hundred dollars excluding attorney fees and the costs of filing the claim and providing the statutorily required notices. Any person seeking a fee or payment exceeding two thousand five hundred dollars may apply to the court for additional compensation but the person has the burden of establishing that the additional compensation is reasonable under the circumstances. This subsection does not preclude a claimant from contesting the reasonableness of any fee or payment that is provided for in an agreement for the recovery of or for assistance in the recovery of excess proceeds.

 

#### Section 33-813. Default in performance of contract secured; reinstatement; cancellation of recorded notice of sale

A. If, prior to the maturity date fixed by the contract or contracts, all or a portion of a principal sum or interest of the contract or contracts secured by a trust deed becomes due or is declared due by reason of a breach or default in the performance of the contract or contracts or of the trust deed, the trustor or the trustor's successor in interest, any person having a subordinate lien or encumbrance of record thereon or any beneficiary under a subordinate trust deed, before 5:00 p.m. mountain standard time on the last day other than a Saturday or legal holiday before the date of sale or the filing of an action to foreclose the trust deed, may reinstate by paying to the beneficiary, the trustee or the trustee's agent in a form acceptable to the beneficiary or the trustee the entire amount then due under the terms of the contract or contracts or trust deed, other than the portion of the principal as would not then be due had no default occurred, by curing all other defaults and by paying the amounts due under subsection B of this section.

B. The beneficiary shall notify the trustee in writing of the performance and the name of the person who performed the conditions. The proceedings shall be cancelled and the contract or contracts and trust deed shall be deemed reinstated and in force as if no breach or default had occurred upon performance of those of the following which may be applicable:

1. Payment of the entire amount then due.

2. Payment of costs and expenses incurred in enforcing the terms of such contract or trust deed.  These costs and expenses may include the following:

(c) Other reasonable costs and expenses.

3. Payment of the recording fee for a cancellation of notice of sale.

4. Payment of the trustee's fees, in an amount not to exceed six hundred dollars or one-half of one per cent of the entire unpaid principal sum secured, whichever is greater.

C. On request from the trustor or any person entitled to notice pursuant to section 33-809, subsection B, at any time that the trust deed is subject to reinstatement, the trustee shall provide a good faith estimate of the sums that appear necessary to reinstate the trust deed.

D. On written request from the trustor or any person entitled to notice pursuant to section 33-809, subsection B that is delivered to the trustee after the recording of the notice of trustee's sale, the trustee shall inform the person of the exact amount necessary to reinstate the trust deed, separately specifying costs, fees and any other amounts that are required to be paid as a condition to reinstatement of the trust deed.  The trustee shall provide that information within five business days after receipt of the written request. If the written request is received by the trustee during the five business days before the day of the sale, the trustee shall provide the information to the person as soon as practicable. This subsection does not require the extension of the period for reinstatement of the trust deed prescribed in subsection A of this section.

E. If the trust deed is reinstated as provided in subsection B of this section, the trustee shall have a cancellation of the notice of sale recorded in the same county recorder's office where the notice of sale was recorded. A trustee who, for thirty days after reinstatement, fails to have proper notice of the cancellation of the notice of sale recorded is liable to the person who performed the conditions resulting in reinstatement for all actual damages resulting from such failure.

F. If the trust deed is paid in full or if the sale is not held or is not properly postponed pursuant to this chapter, the trustee shall record a cancellation of the notice of sale.  The cancellation of the notice of sale shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder in which the notice of sale was recorded.

G. An acknowledged recorded cancellation of a recorded notice of sale under a trust deed shall be sufficient if it is in substantially the following form:

#### Section 33-814. Action to recover balance after sale or foreclosure on property under trust deed

A. Except as provided in subsections F, G and H of this section, within ninety days after the date of sale of trust property under a trust deed pursuant to section 33-807, an action may be maintained to recover a deficiency judgment against any person directly, indirectly or contingently liable on the contract for which the trust deed was given as security including any guarantor of or surety for the contract and any partner of a trustor or other obligor which is a partnership. In any such action against such a person, the deficiency judgment shall be for an amount equal to the sum of the total amount owed the beneficiary as of the date of the sale, as determined by the court less the fair market value of the trust property on the date of the sale as determined by the court or the sale price at the trustee's sale, whichever is higher. A written application for determination of the fair market value of the real property may be filed by a judgment debtor with the court in the action for a deficiency judgment or in any other action on the contract which has been maintained. Notice of the filing of an application and the hearing shall be given to all parties to the action. The fair market value shall be determined by the court at a priority hearing upon such evidence as the court may allow. The court shall issue an order crediting the amount due on the judgment with the greater of the sales price or the fair market value of the real property.  For the purposes of this subsection, "fair market value" means the most probable price, as of the date of the execution sale, in cash, or in terms equivalent to cash, or in other precisely revealed terms, after deduction of prior liens and encumbrances with interest to the date of sale, for which the real property or interest therein would sell after reasonable exposure in the market under conditions requisite to fair sale, with the buyer and seller each acting prudently, knowledgeably and for self-interest, and assuming that neither is under duress. Any deficiency judgment recovered shall include interest on the amount of the deficiency from the date of the sale at the rate provided in the deed of trust or in any of the contracts evidencing the debt, together with any costs and disbursements of the action.

B. If a trustee's sale is a sale of less than all of the trust property or is a sale pursuant to one of two or more trust deeds securing the same obligation, the ninety day time limitations of subsection A of this section shall begin on either the date of the trustee's sale of the last of the trust property to be sold or the date of sale under the last trust deed securing the obligation, whichever occurs last.

C. The obligation of a person who is not a trustor to pay, satisfy or purchase all or a part of the balance due on a contract secured by a trust deed may be enforced, if the person has so agreed, in an action regardless of whether a trustee's sale is held. If, however, a trustee's sale is held, the liability of a person who is not a trustor for the deficiency is determined pursuant to subsection A of this section and any judgment for the deficiency against the person shall be reduced in accordance with subsection A of this section. If any such action is commenced after a trustee's sale has been held, it is subject, in addition, to the ninety day time limitations of subsections A and B of this section.

D. If no action is maintained for a deficiency judgment within the time period prescribed in subsections A and B of this section, the proceeds of the sale, regardless of amount, shall be deemed to be in full satisfaction of the obligation and no right to recover a deficiency in any action shall exist.

E. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, the provisions of this chapter do not preclude a beneficiary from foreclosing a deed of trust in the same manner as a real property mortgage. In an action for the foreclosure of a deed of trust as a real property mortgage the provisions of chapter 6, article 2 of this title are applicable.

F. A deed of trust may, by express language, validly prohibit the recovery of any balance due after trust property is sold pursuant to the trustee's power of sale, or the trust deed is foreclosed in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property.

G. If trust property of two and one-half acres or less which is limited to and utilized for either a single one-family or a single two-family dwelling is sold pursuant to the trustee's power of sale, no action may be maintained to recover any difference between the amount obtained by sale and the amount of the indebtedness and any interest, costs and expenses.

H. For deeds of trust that are originated after December 31, 2014, subsection G of this section does not apply to trust property as follows:

1. Trust property owned by a person who is engaged in the business of constructing and selling dwellings that was acquired by the person in the course of that business and that is subject to a deed of trust given to secure payment of a loan for construction of a dwelling on the property for sale to another person.

2. Trust property that contains a dwelling that was never substantially completed.

3. Trust property that contains a dwelling that is intended to be utilized as a dwelling but that is never actually utilized as a dwelling.

I. For the purposes of this section, a dwelling is substantially completed if either of the following occurs:

1. Final inspection is completed, if required by the governmental body that issued the building permit for the dwelling.

2. If a final inspection is not required by the governmental body that issued the building permit, the dwelling has been completed in all material respects as prescribed in the applicable ordinances and regulations of the governmental body that issued the building permit for the dwelling.

 

#### Section 33-815. Method of indexing

Every trust deed, substitution of trustee, notice of resignation of trustee, request for notice, assignment of beneficial interest under a trust deed, notice of sale, cancellation of notice of sale or deed of release entitled to recordation under the provisions of this chapter shall be indexed in the same manner as mortgages, with the trustor indexed as mortgagor, and if the name of the beneficiary appears on the instrument being recorded, his name or that of his successor shall be indexed as mortgagee. If the name of the beneficiary does not appear on the instrument being recorded the name of the trustee, or his successor, shall be indexed as mortgagee.

#### Section 33-816. Limitation on action or sale of trust property

The trustee's sale of trust property under a trust deed shall be made, or any action to foreclose a trust deed as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property shall be commenced, within the period prescribed by law for the commencement of an action on the contract secured by the trust deed.

#### Section 33-817. Transfer of secured contract

The transfer of any contract or contracts secured by a trust deed shall operate as a transfer of the security for such contract or contracts.

#### Section 33-818. Notice from instruments recorded; assignment of a beneficial interest

Except as otherwise provided in this section, a trust deed, substitution of trustee, notice of resignation of trustee, assignment of a beneficial interest under a trust deed, notice of sale, cancellation of notice of sale, trustee's deed, deed of release, and any instrument by which a trust deed is subordinated or waived as to priority, if acknowledged as provided by law, shall from the time of being recorded impart notice of the content to all persons, including subsequent purchasers and encumbrancers for value. The recording of an assignment of the beneficial interest in a trust deed shall not be deemed notice of such assignment to the trustor, his heirs or personal representatives, so as to invalidate any payment made by them, or any of them, to the person previously holding the note, bond, or other instrument evidencing the contract or contracts secured by the trust deed.

#### Section 33-819. Exempt transactions

If a trust deed is executed for a principal purpose other than or in addition to securing the performance of a contract or contracts, the parties thereto may agree that the provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable. If such an agreement is in writing and is contained in such trust deed the provisions of this chapter shall not be applicable to such trust deed.

#### Section 33-820. Trustee's right to rely; attorney's right to act for trustee and beneficiary

A. In carrying out his duties under the provisions of this chapter or any deed of trust, a trustee, shall when acting in good faith, have the absolute right to rely upon any written direction or information furnished to him by the beneficiary.

B. An attorney for the beneficiary shall also be qualified to act as attorney for the trustee or to be the trustee.

#### Section 33-821. Exemption from definition

A deed of trust shall not be considered a deed or contract under the provisions of title 42, chapter 10, article 2 or a contract for conveyance of real property under the provisions of title 33, chapter 6, article 3.

The shipper, wholesale dealer or manufacturer shall demand a written statement, under oath, from the vendor, giving the names of and amounts due to persons entitled to liens under this article. A vendor who knowingly fails to make the statement when demanded or who knowingly makes a false or misleading statement is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor, and, in addition to the penalty prescribed in section 33-906, shall be liable to any person thus deprived of his lien for double the full amount thereof, and for reasonable attorney's fees if an action is instituted to recover the amount due.

1. One-third of any third-party judgment, settlement or award is exempt from any lien or assignment authorized by this section.

2. If the injured person is covered as an insured or dependent under a health insurance or similar medical benefit plan and the health care provider has a valid and binding contract with that insurer or plan as an in-network provider, the contract must expressly allow the health care provider to assert a lien or assignment that is authorized by this section. In the absence of that contract provision, the lien or assignment is invalid and may not be enforced by a cause of action prescribed by section 33-934 except as allowed under paragraph 3 or 4 of this subsection.

3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection do not apply if any of the following exceptions are met:

#### Section 33-932. Perfecting lien; statement of claim; recording; effect

A. In order to perfect a lien granted by section 33-931, the executive officer, licensed health care provider or agent of a health care provider shall record, before or within thirty days after the patient has received any services relating to the injuries, except a hospital which shall record within thirty days after the patient is discharged, in the office of the recorder in the county in which the health care provider is located a verified statement in writing setting forth all of the following:

1. The name and address of the patient as they appear on the records of the health care provider.

2. The name and location of the health care provider.

3. The name and address of the executive officer or agent of the health care provider, if any.

For health care providers other than hospitals or ambulance services, to the best of the claimant's knowledge, the names and addresses of all persons, firms or corporations and their insurance carriers claimed by the injured person or the injured person's representative to be liable for damages arising from the injuries for which the person received health care.

B. The verified statement shall also include the amount claimed due as of the date of recording of the claim or lien and a statement regarding whether the patient's treatment has been terminated or will be continued. Amounts incurred during the continued period are also subject to the lien.

C. The claimant shall also mail, by first class mail within five days after recording the claim or lien, a copy of the claim or lien to the injured person.  For health care providers other than hospitals or ambulance services the claimant shall also mail a copy to all persons, firms or corporations and their insurance carriers claimed by the injured person or the injured person's representative to be liable for damages arising from the injuries for which the person received health care.  If a health care provider other than a hospital or ambulance service does not record the claim, lien or assignment as provided in this section, the claim, lien or assignment is invalid and may not be enforced by the cause of action provided in section 33-934. If a hospital records such a claim or lien, the recording shall be notice to all persons, firms or corporations liable for damages, whether or not they are named in the claim or lien.

D. A hospital or ambulance service lien that is not recorded within the time prescribed by this section is effective against any settlement or judgment for damages if the lien is recorded thirty days before the settlement is agreed to or the judgment is paid except if the lien is recorded in a county where liens are accessible on the internet, the lien is effective if the lien is accessible on the internet thirty days or more before the settlement is agreed to or the judgment is paid.  If the lien is not recorded or is not accessible on the internet as provided in this section, the lien is invalid and may not be enforced by the cause of action provided in section 33-934.

#### Section 33-933. Recording and indexing lien claim

The recorder shall endorse upon a claim recorded as provided by section 33-932 the date and hour of reception, and such facts as are necessary to indicate that it has been recorded.

#### Section 33-934. Release of claim by injured person ineffective as to lienholder; action to enforce lien

A. A release of claims on which a lien or assignment is given by section 33-931 or of any judgment on that claim is not valid or effectual against the lien or assignment unless the lienholder or assignee joins in the release or executes a release of the lien or assignment. If any amount has been or is to be collected by the injured person or that person's legal representative from or on account of the person, firm or corporation liable for damages by reason of a judgment, settlement or compromise, the claimant or assignee of the lien or assignment may enforce the lien or assignment by action against the person, firm or corporation that is liable for damages, or against any insurer or other person, firm or corporation that is responsible for paying all or part of the damages.

B. An action pursuant to this section shall be commenced and tried in the county in which the lien or assignment is filed, unless ordered by the court to be removed to another county for cause.  The court may allow reasonable attorney fees and disbursements to the prevailing party. The action shall be commenced within two years after the entry of the judgment or the making of the settlement or compromise.  In an action to enforce a lien or assignment, the lienholder or assignee may not recover more than the amount of the lien or assignment nor may it recover more against a defendant in the lien action than that defendant is obligated to pay under judgment or settlement.  The defendant in the lien or assignment action cannot raise as a defense in that action that it is not liable for the amount it is obligated to pay under the judgment or settlement except that it may dispute the amount of the lien on the grounds that the charges giving rise to the lien are erroneous or exceed the customary charges, or that the care, treatment or transportation giving rise to the charges was not medically necessary or causally related to the event giving rise to the claim to which the lien or assignment extends.

C. This section does not create any rights or causes of action on behalf of the lienholder other than are provided for in this section.

B. In determining the extent of the compromise required by subsection A of this section, the health care provider shall consider the following factors:

3. Whether the health care provider, the hospital or an assignee has received any payment reducing the patient's financial obligation to pay the lien balance.

4. The nature and complexity of the services rendered by the health care provider to the patient.

5. The health care provider's customary charges for the services rendered to the patient.

D. If the interested parties cannot agree on a compromise of a lien or assignment as prescribed by this section, an action may be filed for a judicial determination of an appropriate compromise of the lien or assignment based on the factors prescribed by this section. The action may be filed by the injured person whose care, treatment or transportation is subject to a lien or assignment pursuant to section 33-931, the health care provider or assignee, or the person, firm or corporation liable for damages, or any insurer or other person, firm or corporation that is responsible for paying all or part of the damages.  In any action brought pursuant to this section, the prevailing party may not recover attorney fees authorized by section 33-934.

#### Section 33-952. Sale of property; notice

A. When baggage or other property comes into the possession of a person entitled to a lien as provided by section 33-951 and remains unclaimed, or the charges remain unpaid for a period of four months, the person may proceed to sell the baggage or property at public auction, and from the proceeds retain the charges, storage and expense of advertising the sale.

C. Any balance from the sale not claimed by the rightful owner within one month from the day of the sale shall be paid into the treasury of the county in which the sale took place, and if not claimed by the owner within one year thereafter, the money shall be paid into the general fund of the county.

### Article 5 - Judgment Liens on Real Property

#### Section 33-961. Recording judgments for payment of money; certified copy; perfecting lien; information statement; exemption; retroactive applicability

A. A certified copy of the judgment of any court in this state may be filed and recorded in the office of the county recorder in each county where the judgment creditor desires the judgment to become a lien on the real property of the judgment debtor. On recording in substantial compliance with both the requirements of this section and the requirements of section 33-967 regarding an information statement, the judgment becomes a lien on the real property of the judgment debtor, including any part of the real property of the judgment debtor as otherwise provided by law.  Failure to substantially comply with this section and section 33-967, results in the judgment not becoming a lien. The certified copy of the judgment shall set forth the:

1. Title of the court and the action and number of the action.

2. Date of entry of the judgment and the docket record for the judgment.

3. Names of the judgment debtor and judgment creditor.

4. Amount of the judgment.

5. Attorney of record for the judgment creditor.

B. The clerk shall furnish a certified copy of any judgment of that court on request and payment of the fee prescribed by law.

C. A judgment or decree or any renewal that requires payment of money shall also be accompanied by an information statement as prescribed by section 33-967.

D. Notwithstanding subsections A and C of this section, a civil judgment in favor of this state is exempt from the requirement to record an information statement as prescribed in section 33-967 and becomes a lien on the real property of the judgment debtor when it is recorded in the office of the county recorder. This subsection applies retroactively to all judgments in favor of this state without regard to when the judgment was recorded.

 

#### Section 33-962. Procedure for filing judgment of justice or municipal court; recording; lien

A. A judgment of a justice or municipal court may be prepared for recording using either of the following procedures:

1. The clerk of the superior court, on presentation of a certified transcript of a judgment for more than fifteen dollars, exclusive of costs, given by a justice or municipal court, shall forthwith file the judgment.  From the time of filing the transcript of the judgment, that judgment shall be deemed the judgment of the superior court, shall be in the control of the superior court and shall be carried into execution in the same manner and with like effect as a judgment of the superior court.

2. The clerk of a justice court or municipal court shall issue a certified copy of any judgment of that court on request and payment of the fee prescribed by law.  On issuance of the certified copy of the justice court or municipal court judgment, the certified copy of the judgment may be recorded and may be executed in the same manner and with like effect as a judgment of the superior court.

B. Any judgment must be recorded in the manner provided in section 33-961 before it becomes a lien on or in any manner affects or encumbers the real property of the judgment debtor or any part of the real property of the judgment debtor.

 

#### Section 33-963. Procedure for recording judgment of federal court; lien

An abstract of a judgment given by any court of record of the United States within this state shall be recorded in the manner provided in section 33-961 and in compliance with section 33-967, if applicable, before the judgment becomes a lien upon, or in any manner affects or encumbers, the real property of the judgment debtor, or any part thereof.

#### Section 33-964. Lien of judgment; duration; homestead; partial release of judgment lien; acknowledgment of satisfaction by judgment creditor; applicability; definition

A. Except as provided in sections 33-729 and 33-730, from and after the time of recording as provided in section 33-961, a judgment shall become a lien for a period of ten years after the date it is given on all real property of the judgment debtor in the county in which the judgment is recorded, whether the property is then owned by the judgment debtor or is later acquired. A civil judgment lien obtained by this state and a judgment lien for support, as defined in section 25-500, remain in effect until satisfied or lifted.

B. On the sale of homestead property that is subject to a judgment lien, the judgment creditor shall be paid from the proceeds of the sale after the homestead exemption amount is paid to the judgment debtor as prescribed in section 33-1101 and after payment of any liens on the property that have priority over the judgment lien.  After deducting from the proceeds of the sale the amount of any consensual liens and the reasonable costs of sale, if the anticipated payment to the judgment debtor is less than eighty percent of the amount of the homestead exemption prescribed by section 33-1101, a title insurer or its duly appointed attorney in fact may record a notice of partial release of judgment without prior notice to judgment creditors. If the anticipated payment to the judgment debtor is eighty percent of the amount of the homestead exemption prescribed by section 33-1101, the judgment creditor's lien on the homestead property is extinguished on compliance with the following:

1. At least twenty days before the sale is final, a title insurer mails to the judgment creditor by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, a notice that the judgment lien appears reasonably likely to be extinguished as prescribed by this subsection.  The notice must contain all of the following:

(a) The judgment creditor's name.

(b) The name of the current record owner of the real property.

(c) The street address for the property.

(d) The recording reference for the judgment.

(e) The expected sale date on which title to the real property will transfer to the buyer.

(f) The title insurer's basis for determining that the homestead exemption prescribed by section 33-1101 applies to the property being sold.

(g) The information used in, the basis for and the date of calculating the amount of equity in the real property.

(h) The name of every lienholder to be paid at the sale of the real property.

(i) The amount paid to each lienholder at the sale of the real property.

(j) The title insurer's basis for determining that the prior lienholder should be paid before the judgment creditor.

2. The title insurer shall amend the notice prescribed by paragraph 1 of this subsection if the anticipated payment to the judgment debtor increases by more than $10,000.

3. If the judgment creditor has good cause to believe that the judgment lien should not be extinguished, the judgment creditor may object to the title insurer's notice within twenty days after the date the notice is mailed. If the title insurer receives an objection from the judgment creditor within the twenty-day period stating that the judgment lien should not be extinguished, the title insurer may not record the partial release of the judgment lien. If a court later determines that the judgment creditor's objection is without good cause, the prevailing party in that action is entitled to a court order extinguishing the judgment lien on the homestead property and an award of actual damages, court costs and attorney fees and any other remedy provided by law.

4. If the title insurer does not receive an objection from the judgment creditor before the twenty-day period expires, the title insurer may prepare, sign and record a notice of partial release of the judgment lien. The notice of partial release of the judgment lien must specify the real property that is no longer subject to the judgment lien and cite this subsection of statute. The person signing the notice of partial release of the judgment lien must be the title insurer's authorized agent.

5. The title insurer may charge a reasonable fee to the owner of the real property or any other person who requests a notice of partial release of the judgment lien under this subsection for services rendered, including title search, document preparation, official fees and mailing costs.

6. A recorded notice of partial release of the judgment lien is conclusive evidence that the judgment lien on the specified property is extinguished in favor of purchasers and encumbrancers for value. The notice of partial release of the judgment lien does not affect a judgment lien on any other real property.

7. Compliance with this subsection is not presumed, excused, released or altered by a recorded notice of partial release of a judgment lien.

8. In addition to any other remedy provided by law, a title insurer that prepares or records the notice of partial release of the judgment lien under this subsection is liable to any party for the actual damages, including attorney fees and court costs, that are caused by wrongfully recording the notice of partial release of the judgment lien.

9. A judgment creditor may waive the notice requirement prescribed in paragraph 1 of this subsection if the waiver is in writing and signed by the judgment creditor's authorized agent.

C. If the judgment debtor receives cash proceeds from refinancing the homestead property that is subject to a judgment lien, the judgment creditor must be paid in full from those proceeds before the judgment debtor or other person receives any proceeds, except that monies used to pay direct costs associated with the refinance or to satisfy liens with priority over a judgment lien on a homestead property do not constitute cash proceeds. In subsequent refinance transactions on the homestead property that is subject to a judgment lien, the judgment lien is subordinated by operation of law to the new lender's interest in the homestead property. A notice of subordination may be recorded by any person who is a party to that refinance.

D. Any person who records a notice, including a notice of release of a judgment lien as prescribed by this section, shall mail a copy of the recorded notice to the judgment creditor whose judgment lien is affected by that recorded document.

E. A judgment of the justice court, municipal court, superior court or United States court that has become a lien under this article, immediately on the payment or satisfaction of the judgment, shall be discharged of record by the judgment creditor or the judgment creditor's attorney by recording a satisfaction of judgment with the county recorder of the county in which the judgment is recorded. The judgment creditor or the judgment creditor’s attorney shall enter a notation of satisfaction on the docket of the clerk of the superior court of each county in which the judgment has been entered or docketed, and in a like manner enter a notation of satisfaction on the docket of the clerk of the United States district court.

F. In a title IV-D case, if the title IV-D agency or its agent is listed as the holder of the lien and the judgment has been satisfied but the obligee is unwilling to sign the release of the lien or, after reasonable efforts, cannot be located to sign the release of the lien, the title IV-D agency or its agent may sign the satisfaction of judgment and release of lien without the signature of the obligee.  The title IV-D agency or its agent shall send a copy by first class mail to the last known address of the obligee.

G. For any sale, transfer or refinance of a judgment debtor's homestead property that is completed before January 1, 2022, a judgment lien does not attach to the homestead property.  A judgment lien is not created on the judgment debtor's homestead property if either:

1. A court of competent jurisdiction, including the United States bankruptcy court, has discharged or enjoined enforcement of the judgment before January 1, 2022.

2. There is a bankruptcy petition that is pending before January 1, 2022 for which a discharge is ultimately granted.

H. For any sale, transfer or refinance that is completed on or after January 1, 2022, judgments that are recorded before January 1, 2022 and that are still valid attach to the homestead property, are enforceable and create judgment liens as prescribed by this section.  At the time of the sale, transfer or refinance of a homestead property, the following apply to the priority of judgment liens created by this subsection for only the homestead property:

1. Judgment liens are junior to all valid and unpaid consensual liens that existed on the property on or before December 31, 2021.

2. Priority of judgment liens created by this subsection is determined by the date on which the judgment is recorded as prescribed by section 33-961 and, if applicable, is subject to subsection C of this section.

I. For the purposes of this section, "title insurer" has the same meaning prescribed in section 20-1562.

#### Section 33-965. Entry of reversal or remittitur upon judgment docket; affidavit

When a judgment which has been docketed or recorded is reversed on appeal, and the judgment of reversal is filed, or a remittitur is filed, the clerk shall forthwith make entry thereof on the docket. The entry of such reversal or remittitur shall be made by affidavit to be submitted by such judgment creditor or his counsel, which shall thereupon be recorded and indexed as releases of judgment are recorded and indexed.

#### Section 33-966. Superiority of lien for personal injury judgment against person operating railway

A. Judgment against a person operating a railway, or a street railway for injury to any person or property in the operation of the railway shall be a lien within the county where judgment is given, upon the property of such person prior and superior to the lien of any mortgage or trust deed.

#### Section 33-967. Money judgment; information statement; amendment to recorded judgment; exemption; retroactive applicability

A. In addition to the requirements prescribed by section 33-961, any judgment or decree or any renewal that requires the payment of money and that is recorded on or after January 1, 1997, shall not become a lien on real property until a separate information statement is attached to the judgment being recorded. The separate information statement shall contain all of the following information:

1. The correct name and last known address of each judgment debtor and the address at which each judgment debtor received the summons by personal service or by mail.

2. The name and address of the judgment creditor.

3. The amount of the judgment or decree as entered or as most recently renewed.

4. If the judgment debtor is a natural person, the judgment debtor's social security number, date of birth and driver license number.

5. Whether a stay of enforcement has been ordered by the court and the date the stay expires.

B. Except as provided in this subsection, the separate statement shall contain the information prescribed by subsection A of this section if the information is known to the judgment creditor or available to the judgment creditor from its records, its attorney's records or the court records in the action in which the judgment was entered. If any of the required information is not known, the judgment creditor shall so state. The judgment debtor's social security number shall be included in the separate statement only if it has been provided voluntarily to the judgment creditor by the judgment debtor.

C. A judgment or decree or any renewal that requires the payment of money, that is recorded on or after January 1, 1997 and that is not accompanied by the separate statement as prescribed by subsection A of this section does not become a lien on real property until the judgment creditor records a document entitled "amendment to recorded judgment" that contains a separate statement that is in compliance with subsection A of this section. The amendment to recorded judgment shall state the date of recording and the indexing or document number of the official records of the county recorder for the original recorded judgment or decree and any renewals.

D. Recording an amendment to recorded judgment does not affect the computation of time prescribed by section 33-964.

E. A civil judgment in favor of this state is exempt from this section.  This subsection applies retroactively to all judgments in favor of this state without regard to when the judgment was recorded.

 

#### Section 33-968. Erroneously identified property owner; lien; release

A. If a recorded money judgment or a certified copy of a money judgment appears to create a judgment lien on the real property of a person who is not the judgment debtor because the name of the property owner is the same as or similar to that of the judgment debtor, the erroneously identified property owner may deliver to the judgment creditor a written demand for a recordable document that releases the lien. The demand shall be accompanied by reasonable proof that the property owner is not the judgment debtor and that the property is not subject to enforcement of the judgment against the judgment debtor.

B. Within fifteen days after receipt of the property owner's demand and compliance with subsection A, the judgment creditor shall deliver to the property owner a recordable document that releases the lien on the property of that owner. If the judgment creditor improperly fails to deliver a recordable document within that time, the judgment creditor is liable to the property owner for all damages incurred by reason of the failure and is presumed liable for at least five hundred dollars.

C. If the judgment creditor does not deliver a document as prescribed by subsection B, the property owner may apply to the court for an order releasing the judgment lien. The application shall be served on the judgment creditor. On presentation of evidence satisfactory to the court that the property is not subject to the judgment, the court shall order the judgment creditor to prepare and deliver a recordable document that releases the lien or by order of the court may release the judgment lien on the property. The order may be recorded in the office of the county recorder in the county where the property is located and shall release the judgment lien on the property.

D. The court shall award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party in any action pursuant to this section.

E. The damages and other remedies provided by this section are not in derogation of any other remedy that a person may be entitled to by law.

If no labor commences on a property or no materials are furnished to the property, a registered professional may record and foreclose on a lien at any time after the registered professional's work has commenced if the registered professional's work has added value to the property. If labor or materials are furnished to the property, the priority of the registered professional's lien is governed by subsection B of this section.

D. Liens for professional services shall attach not before but at the same time, and shall have the same priority, as other liens provided for in this article.

E. If any improvement at the site is not provided for in any contract for the construction of any building or other structure, the improvement at the site is a separate work and the commencement of the improvement is not commencement of the construction of the building or other structure. The liens arising from work and labor done or professional services or materials furnished for each improvement at the site shall have a separate priority from liens arising from work and labor done or professional services or materials furnished for the construction of the building or other structure.  A lien arising from work or labor done or materials furnished for each improvement at the site attaches to property for priority purposes at the time labor was commenced or materials were commenced to be furnished pursuant to the contract between the owner and original contractor for that improvement to the site.  For purposes of this subsection, "improvement at the site" means any of the following on any lot or tract of land or the street, highway or sidewalk in front of or adjoining any lot or tract of land:

1. Demolition or removal of improvements, trees or other vegetation.

2. Drilling of test holes.

3. Grading, filling or otherwise improving.

4. Constructing or installing sewers or other public utilities.

5. Constructing or installing streets, highways or sidewalks.

2. "Original contractor" means any contractor who has a direct contractual relationship with the owner.

3. "Owner" means the person, or the person's successor in interest, that causes a building, structure or improvement to be constructed, altered or repaired, whether the interest or estate of the person is in fee, as vendee under a contract to purchase, as lessee, or other interest or estate less than fee. If an interest or estate is held by two or more persons as community property, joint tenants or tenants in common, any one or more of the persons may be deemed the owner.

4. "Preliminary twenty day notice" means one or more written notices from a claimant that are given before the recording of a mechanic's lien and that are required to be given pursuant to this section.

B. Except for a person performing actual labor for wages, every person who furnishes labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools for which a lien otherwise may be claimed under this article shall, as a necessary prerequisite to the validity of any claim of lien, serve the owner or reputed owner, the original contractor or reputed contractor, the construction lender, if any, or reputed construction lender, if any, and the person with whom the claimant has contracted for the purchase of those items with a written preliminary twenty day notice as prescribed by this section.

E. If labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools are furnished to a jobsite by a person who elects not to give a preliminary twenty day notice as provided in subsection B of this section, that person is not precluded from giving a preliminary twenty day notice not later than twenty days after furnishing other labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools to the same jobsite.  The person, however, is entitled to claim a lien only for such labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools furnished within twenty days before the service of the notice and at any time thereafter.

F. The notice or notices required by this section may be given by mailing the notice by first class mail sent with a certificate of mailing, registered or certified mail, postage prepaid in all cases, addressed to the person to whom notice is to be given at the person's residence or business address. Service is complete at the time of the deposit of notice in the mail.

G. A person required by this section to give notice to the owner, to an original contractor, to the construction lender, if any, and to the person with whom the claimant has contracted need give only one notice to the owner, to the original contractor, to the construction lender, if any, and to the person with whom the claimant has contracted with respect to all labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools furnished for the building, structure or improvement, unless the actual estimated total price for the labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools furnished or to be furnished exceeds by thirty percent or more the total price in any prior original or subsequent preliminary notice or unless the labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools are furnished under contracts with more than one subcontractor, in which case notice requirements shall be met for all additional labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools.

H. If a notice contains a general description required by subsection C of this section of the labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools furnished up to the date of notice, it is not defective because after the date the person giving notice furnishes labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools that are not within the scope of the general description, or exceed by less than thirty percent the estimated total price thereof.

I. Within ten days after receipt of a written request from any person or the person's agent intending to file a preliminary twenty day notice, which request shall identify the person, the person's address, the jobsite and the general nature of the person's labor, professional services, materials, machinery or tools to which the preliminary twenty day notice shall apply, or within ten days after the receipt of a preliminary twenty day notice, the owner or other interested party shall furnish the person a written statement containing the following information:

1. The legal description, subdivision plat, street address or location with respect to commonly known roads or other landmarks in the area, or any other description of the jobsite sufficient for identification.

2. The name and address of the owner or reputed owner.

4. The name and address of the construction lender, if any, or reputed construction lender.

5. If any payment bond has been recorded pursuant to section 33-1003, a copy of the bond and the name and address of the surety company and bonding agent, if any, providing the payment bond.

J. Failure of the owner or other interested party to furnish the information required by this section does not excuse any claimant from timely giving a preliminary twenty day notice, but it does stop the owner from raising as a defense any inaccuracy of the information in a preliminary twenty day notice, provided the claimant's preliminary twenty day notice of lien otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter. If the information is received by the claimant after the claimant has given a preliminary twenty day notice and the information contained in the preliminary twenty day notice is inaccurate, the claimant shall, within thirty days of the receipt of this information, give an amended preliminary twenty day notice in the manner provided in this section. An amended preliminary twenty day notice is considered as having been given at the same time as the original preliminary twenty day notice, except that the amended preliminary twenty day notice is effective only as to work performed, materials supplied or professional services rendered twenty days before the date of the amended preliminary twenty day notice or the date the original preliminary twenty day notice was given to the owner, whichever occurs first. If a payment bond has been recorded in compliance with section 33-1003 and the owner or other interested party fails to furnish a copy of the bond and the other information as required by this section, the claimant shall retain lien rights to the extent precluded or prejudiced from asserting a claim against the bond as a direct result of not timely receiving a copy of the bond and the other information from the owner or other interested party.

#### Section 33-992.02. Proof of mailing of preliminary twenty day notice; receipt; affidavit

The affidavit shall show the name and address of the person to whom a copy of the preliminary twenty day notice was mailed, and, if appropriate, the title or capacity in which he was given the notice.

B. For purposes of this section, if a work of improvement consists of the construction for residential occupancy of more than one separate building without regard to whether the buildings are constructed pursuant to separate contracts or a single contract, each building is a separate work and the time within which to perfect a lien by recording the notice of lien pursuant to subsection A of this section commences to run on the completion of each separate building.

(b) Resides or intends to reside in the dwelling at least thirty days during the twelve-month period immediately following completion of the construction, alteration, repair or improvement and does not intend to sell or lease the dwelling to others.

(i) The placing of his or her personal belongings and furniture in the dwelling, and

(ii) Occupancy either by the person or members of his or her family. A single act shall not establish a person as an owner-occupant if such person permits exclusive occupancy by other than members of his or her family for other than temporary purposes thereby negating his or her intent to reside in the dwelling primarily for use as his or her home.

B. No lien provided for in this article shall be allowed or recorded by the person claiming a lien against the dwelling of a person who became an owner-occupant prior to the construction, alteration, repair or improvement, except by a person having executed in writing a contract directly with the owner-occupant.

B. A payment bond furnished pursuant to subsection A of this section shall be in the amount and form prescribed by title 34, chapter 2, article 2. The contract recorded with the bond shall contain a legal description of the land on which the work is being or is to be performed.

C.

A. After perfection of a lien pursuant to this article, an owner, including any person who has a legal or equitable interest in the land that is subject to the lien, a contractor, subcontractor, mortgagee or other lien creditor, either before or after the commencement of an action to foreclose such lien, may cause to be recorded in the office of the county recorder, in the county in which the land is located, a surety bond in the form described in subsection B of this section, together with a power of attorney disclosing the authority of the person executing the same on behalf of the surety. On the recordation of the bond, the property shall be discharged of such lien whether or not a copy of the bond is served on the claimant or the claimant perfects the claimant's rights against the bond.

B. A surety bond to discharge a lien perfected under this section shall be executed by the person seeking to discharge such lien, as principal, and by a surety company or companies holding a certificate of authority to transact surety business in this state, issued by the director of the department of insurance and financial institutions pursuant to title 20, chapter 2, article 1.  The bond shall be for the sole protection of the claimant who perfected such lien. Notwithstanding any other statute, the surety bond shall not be executed by an individual surety or sureties, even if the requirements of section 7-101 are satisfied.  The bond shall be in an amount equal to one hundred fifty percent of the demand set forth in and secured by the notice and claim of lien and shall be conditioned for the payment of the judgment that would have been rendered against the property for the enforcement of the lien. The legal description of the property and the docket and page of the lien sought to be discharged shall be set forth in the bond.

C. The principal on such bond, on recording the bond with the county recorder, shall cause a copy of the bond to be served within a reasonable time on the lien claimant, and if a suit is then pending to foreclose the lien, the claimant, within ninety days after receipt thereof, shall cause proceedings to be instituted to add the surety and the principal as parties to the lien foreclosure suit.  In addition, on recording and service of the surety bond, any monies withheld in response to a stop notice or bonded stop notice that is served by the lien claimant pursuant to article 9 of this chapter with respect to the same labor and material described in the notice and claim of lien shall be released promptly.

D. The bond shall be discharged and the principal and sureties released on any of the following:

1. The failure of the lien claimant to commence a suit within the time allowed pursuant to section 33-998.

2. The failure of the lien claimant to name the principal and sureties as parties to the action seeking foreclosure of the lien if a copy of the bond has been served on the claimant. If the bond is served on the claimant within less than ninety days after the date the claimant would be required to commence the claimant's action pursuant to section 33-998, the claimant shall have ninety days after the date the claimant receives a copy of such bond to add the principal and the sureties as parties to the lien foreclosure suit.

3. The dismissal of the foreclosure suit with prejudice as to the claimant or the entry of judgment in such suit against claimant.

E. In an action to foreclose a lien under this article, where a bond has been filed and served as provided herein, a judgment for the claimant on the bond shall be against the principal and the principal's sureties for the reasonable value of the labor and material furnished and shall not be against the property.  A judgment for the claimant on the bond, including any recovery for interest, expenses, costs and attorney fees awarded by the court, shall not exceed the penal sum of the bond.  If the amount the claimant recovers exceeds the penal sum of the bond, the claimant shall also be entitled to judgment against the principal for the excess amount.

F. If a copy of the bond is not served on the claimant as provided in subsection C of this section, the claimant shall have six months after the discovery of the bond to commence an action thereon, except that no action may be commenced on the bond after two years from the date it was recorded as provided in this section.

G. The county recorder of the county in which the bond and contract are recorded shall index the bond and contract under the index classification in which mechanics' and materialmen's liens are recorded.

#### Section 33-1005. Payments made in trust

Monies paid by or for an owner-occupant as defined in section 33-1002 to a contractor, as defined in section 32-1101, as payment for labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools for which a lien is not provided in this article shall be deemed for all purposes to be paid in trust and shall be held by the contractor for the benefit of the person or persons furnishing such labor, professional services, materials, machinery, fixtures or tools. Such monies shall neither be diverted nor used for any purpose other than to satisfy the claims of those for whom the trust is created and shall be paid when due to the person or persons entitled thereto. The provisions of this section shall not affect other remedies available at law or in equity.

#### Section 33-1006. Release of mechanic's and materialman's liens; liability

A. When any lien established by the provisions of this article has been satisfied, the lienholder shall, within twenty days after satisfaction, issue a release of the lien.

B. When any lien prohibited to be filed against the dwelling of an owner-occupant as defined in section 33-1002 has been recorded, the person claiming the lien shall, within twenty days of the written request of the owner-occupant, issue a release of the lien.

C. The release issued pursuant to this section shall be in document form as specified in section 11-480. Failure to grant such a release shall subject the lienholder or person to liability in the amount of one thousand dollars and also to liability for actual damages.

#### Section 33-1008. Waiver of lien

A. An owner or contractor by any term of their contract, or otherwise, may not waive or impair the claims or liens of other persons whether with or without notice except by their written consent or as prescribed by section 33-1003. Any term of the contract to that effect shall be void. Any written consent given by any claimant pursuant to this section is unenforceable unless the claimant executes and delivers a waiver and release. This waiver and release is effective to release the property for the benefit of the owner, the construction lender, the contractor and the surety on a payment bond from claims and liens only if the waiver and release follows substantially one of the forms set forth in this section and is signed by the claimant or his authorized agent, and, in the case of a conditional release, if there is evidence of payment to the claimant. Evidence of payment may be by the claimant's endorsement on a single or joint payee check that has been paid by the bank on which it was drawn or by written acknowledgment of payment given by the claimant.

B. No oral or written statement purporting to waive, release or otherwise adversely affect a claim is enforceable or creates any estoppel or impairment of a claim unless it is pursuant to a waiver and release prescribed by this section or the claimant had actually received payment in full for the claim.

C. This section does not affect the enforceability of either an accord and satisfaction regarding a bona fide dispute or any agreement made in settlement of an action pending in any court provided the accord and satisfaction or agreement and settlement make specific reference to the mechanic's lien or bond claims.

D. The waiver and release given by any claimant is unenforceable unless it follows substantially the following forms in the following circumstances:

1. Where the claimant is required to execute a waiver and release in exchange for or in order to induce the payment of a progress payment and the claimant is not in fact paid in exchange for the waiver and release or a single payee check or joint payee check is given in exchange for the waiver and release, the waiver and release shall follow substantially the following form:

### Article 7 - Personal Property Liens

#### Section 33-1021. Lien for labor or materials furnished on personal property; right to possess property

When an article, implement, utensil or vehicle, except motor vehicles, is repaired or cleaned, glazed or washed, with labor, with or without material, by a carpenter, mechanic, artisan or other workman, such person shall have a lien thereon for the labor or material and may retain possession thereof until the amount due is fully paid.

#### Section 33-1021.01. Dry cleaners' and launderers' lien; foreclosure

A. When any garment, wearing apparel or other article is cleaned, pressed or washed by any dry cleaner or launderer, the dry cleaner or launderer has a lien on the garment, apparel or article for the labor and may retain possession of the garment, apparel or article until the amount due is fully paid.

B. The lien for any article in the possession of a dry cleaner or launderer granted by subsection A may be foreclosed by private or public sale or by disposal in any manner determined by the dry cleaner or launderer if all of the following conditions exist:

1. The dry cleaner or launderer has posted on the premises, plainly visible to the owner or agent of the garment, wearing apparel or other article to be cleaned, pressed or washed, a poster, no less in size than eighteen inches by twenty-four inches, notifying that the garment, apparel or other article may be disposed of on or after ninety days if unclaimed. The notice shall also be imprinted on the receipt given to the owner or agent.

2. The article remains in the possession of the dry cleaner or launderer and the charges are unpaid for a period of ninety days from the date the article is received to be cleaned, pressed or washed.

#### Section 33-1022. Garages; aircraft

A. Proprietors of garages and repair and service stations shall have a lien upon motor vehicles of every kind and aircraft, and the parts and accessories placed thereon, for labor, materials, supplies and storage for the amount of the charges, when the amount of the charges is agreed to by the proprietor and the owner.

B. The lien shall not impair any other lien or conditional sale of record at the time the labor, materials, supplies and storage were commenced to be furnished, unless furnished with the knowledge and consent of the record lienor or vendor.

C. If a proprietor has a lien on an aircraft pursuant to subsection A of this section, the proprietor who provides labor, materials, supplies and storage for aircraft may relinquish possession of the aircraft and retain the lien by recording the lien with the county recorder of the county in which the labor, materials, supplies or storage were provided. The lien shall be filed with the county recorder within thirty days after possession is relinquished. In addition, the proprietor may record the lien with the federal aviation administration aircraft registry. A lien filed with the federal aviation administration aircraft registry shall comply with all requirements of federal law and shall accurately describe the aircraft, list the amount of the claim, list the date on which the labor, materials, supplies or storage were last furnished, be signed by the claimant showing the title of the signer, if appropriate, and be accompanied by the recording fee.

D. A lien which is filed with a county recorder pursuant to subsection C of this section does not bind a purchaser of the aircraft without actual notice of the lien unless the lien has also been recorded with the federal aviation administration aircraft registry. A lien authorized under subsection C of this section may be foreclosed only by an action in court.

E. When an aircraft lien which has been recorded under this section has been satisfied, the lienholder within thirty days after satisfaction shall issue a release of the lien to the person against whom the lien was claimed and shall record the release of that lien in the county in which the lien was recorded and with the federal aviation administration aircraft registry, if the lien was recorded there. Failure to record a release upon satisfaction of the lien shall subject the lienholder to the penalties prescribed in section 33-712.

#### Section 33-1022.01. Fabrication work; lien

#### Section 33-1023. Sale of property; disposal of proceeds

A. Except as provided in section 33-1021.01, when possession of any property described in this article or any other personal property held under lien without provision at law for foreclosure of the lien has continued for twenty days after the charges accrue and remain unpaid, the person holding the property may notify the owner, if in the county where the property is located, to pay the charges. Upon failure of the owner within ten days thereafter to pay the charges, the holder of the property may sell it at public auction and apply the proceeds to payment of the charges. The balance of the proceeds shall be paid to the person entitled thereto. If the owner's residence is not in the county where the property is located, the holder is not required to give the ten days' notice before proceeding to sell.

B. Five days' notice of sale shall be given to the owner if he can be found, and if not, then by two publications in a newspaper published in the county.

C. If the person legally entitled to receive the balance is not known or has removed from the county, the holder shall pay the balance to the department of revenue. If the party, at any time within two years from the date of payment to the department of revenue, establishes his right to the money to the satisfaction of the director of the department of administration, it shall be paid to him.  After two years, all unclaimed monies shall be deposited in the permanent state school fund.

1. The stop notice claims of all subcontractors or material suppliers who have filed bonded stop notices for work done on behalf of the original contractor or subcontractor.

2. The amount of any payment already received as described in the stop notice or bonded stop notice.

#### Section 33-1056. Effective notice

A. The stop notice shall be delivered to the owner personally or left at the owner's residence with a person of suitable age and discretion or the owner's place of business. If the notice is served on a construction lender who holds construction monies and who maintains branch offices, it is not effective against the construction lender unless it is given to or served on the manager or other responsible officer or person at the office or branch that administers or holds the construction monies. Any stop notice may be served by certified mail with the same effect as by personal service.

B. Service of a stop notice or bonded stop notice is effective only if the claimant complies with all of the following:

#### Section 33-1057. Withholding of money by owner; payment bond

If a payment bond is recorded, the owner may withhold the monies.

B. If the owner elects not to withhold pursuant to a stop notice by reason of a payment bond having been recorded in accordance with section 33-1003, the owner within thirty days after receipt of the stop notice shall give a written notice to the claimant at the address shown in the stop notice that the bond has been recorded and shall furnish to the claimant a copy of that bond.

#### Section 33-1058. Withholding monies by construction lenders; payment bond

A. On receipt of a stop notice pursuant to section 33-1055, the construction lender may and on receipt of a bonded stop notice shall withhold from the borrower or other person to whom it or the owner may be obligated to make payments or advances out of the construction fund sufficient monies to answer the claim and any claim of lien that may be recorded. If a payment bond has previously been recorded in accordance with section 33-1003, the construction lender shall withhold monies pursuant to a bonded stop notice filed by the original contractor and, at its option, may withhold monies pursuant to a stop notice or bonded stop notice given by anyone other than the original contractor.

B. The construction lender may elect not to withhold pursuant to a bonded stop notice if a payment bond has been recorded in accordance with section 33-1003. When giving the construction lender the stop notice or bonded stop notice, if the claimant makes a written request for notice of the election, accompanied by a preaddressed, stamped envelope, the construction lender shall furnish to the claimant a copy of the bond within thirty days after making the election. A lender is not liable for a failure to furnish a copy of the bond if the failure was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error, if the lender maintains reasonable procedures to avoid such an error and if the error was corrected no more than twenty days after the date on which the error was discovered.

#### Section 33-1059. Assignment of monies; effect

A. Whether made before or after a stop notice or bonded stop notice is given to a construction lender, no assignment by the owner or contractor of construction monies takes priority over the stop notice or bonded stop notice, and the assignment has no effect as to the rights of claimants who give the stop notice or bonded stop notice.

B. Any allocation or disbursement of any sum from construction monies by a construction lender for the payment of loan fees, interest or other charges to the construction lender is not an assignment under subsection A and is not subject to any stop notice or bonded stop notice given to the construction lender.

#### Section 33-1060. Pro rata distribution of monies

If monies withheld or required to be withheld pursuant to any stop notice or bonded stop notice are insufficient to pay in full the valid claims of all persons who made claims, the monies withheld or required to be withheld shall be distributed among those persons in the same ratio that their respective claims bear to the aggregate of all such valid claims.

The lien is created only if all of the following apply:

1. There is a written agreement between the broker and the owner of the real property that provides for the payment of a commission or other compensation to that broker for the broker's services in a real estate transaction and that agreement discloses in the same size type as the majority of the remainder of the agreement above the portion of the agreement calling for the signature of the owner of the real property that the failure to pay the agreed upon commission or compensation may give rise to lien rights as provided by this article.

2. The broker produces a person or entity that is ready, willing and able to lease or rent the real property on the terms provided in the written agreement between the broker and the owner of the real property or on terms that are otherwise acceptable to the owner as evidenced by a written instrument that is signed by the owner.

3. The broker fully complies with sections 33-1072 and 33-1073.

4. All of the conditions for the payment of the commission or other compensation described in the written agreement have been satisfied.

B. Mechanics' and materialmen's lien rights established pursuant to title 33, chapter 7, article 6 have priority over the lien rights created by this article.

C. Consensual liens, mortgages and deeds of trust that are recorded before the recordation of the broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien have priority over the lien rights created by this article and over the notice of commercial real estate broker lien recorded pursuant to this article.

D. Real property is not subject to a commercial real estate broker lien pursuant to this article if either of the following apply:

1. The real property is conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value before the recordation of a broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien.

2. It is encumbered by a bona fide lender for value before the recordation of a broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien.

E. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, the lien rights provided by this article apply to all commercial real property and do not apply to any transaction involving either of the following:

1. Residential real property with fewer than five residential units.

2. Real property on which single family mobile home lots, manufactured housing lots, residences or condominiums are sold unit by unit.

F. For purposes of this article, "real property" or "subject real property" means the real property interest that is owned by the person who is the party to the agreement with the broker as prescribed by this section.

 

#### Section 33-1072. Lien attachment; notice of commercial real estate broker lien; notice to owner

A. A lien pursuant to this article attaches to the subject real property when all of the following occur:

1. The broker produces a person or entity that is ready, willing and able to lease or rent the real property on the terms provided in the written agreement between the broker and the owner of the real property or on terms that are otherwise acceptable to the owner as evidenced by a written instrument that is signed by the owner.

2. The broker fully complies with subsection B of this section.

3. The broker records a document entitled "notice of commercial real estate broker lien" in the office of the county recorder in the county or counties in which the subject real property is located.  The notice of commercial real estate broker lien shall be recorded as follows:

(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b), if the notice of commercial real estate broker lien is based on a lease or rental of the real property, the notice of commercial real estate broker lien shall be recorded within ninety days after the tenant takes possession of the leased premises.

(b) If the notice of commercial real estate broker lien is based on compensation that is to be paid in installments and any of those installments are due after the lease or rental of the real property, the notice of commercial real estate broker lien shall be recorded within ninety days after the tenant takes possession of the real property and is valid only to the extent that monies remain unpaid by the owner of the real property to the broker.

B. On recording the notice of commercial real estate broker lien, the broker's lien is perfected.

C. Not later than fifteen days before the date that the tenant takes possession of the leased premises, the broker shall record a document entitled "broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien" in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the real property is located and shall deliver personally or by first class mail a copy of the broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien to the owner of the real property interest.  The broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien shall state that the broker is entitled to compensation under the terms set forth in the written agreement between the broker and the owner and that the broker intends to claim a lien on the real property.  The broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien shall include all of the information prescribed by section 33-1073, subsection A and shall be entitled "broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien".  The broker's failure to record the broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien within the time prescribed by this subsection extinguishes the broker's lien rights.

B. The words "unknown" or "not available" and similar terms may not be used in lieu of the information prescribed by subsection A, and any use of those terms in the notice of commercial real estate broker lien or broker's preliminary notice of intent to lien invalidates the commercial real estate broker lien.

#### Section 33-1074. Foreclosure; limitation of action; attorney fees

A. A commercial real estate broker lien recorded pursuant to this article is enforceable by foreclosure action in superior court as if the lien were a mortgage.

B. A lien pursuant to this article is only valid for two years after the date that it is recorded unless an action is brought within that two years to enforce the lien and a notice of pendency of the action is recorded pursuant to section 12-1191 in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the property is located within five days after filing the action.

C. In any action to foreclose a commercial real estate broker lien, the prevailing party shall be awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees.

The creditor shall demand the designation by sending a letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, to each address of the person which may reasonably be protected by the homestead exemption. The person shall designate the property by recording a homestead exemption in the office of the county recorder where the property is located or by sending the creditor a certified letter, return receipt requested, within thirty days of receiving the creditor's demand letter. If the person receives the creditor's letter and fails to respond as provided by this subsection, the person may only assert the homestead exemption by recording a claim in the office of the county recorder where the property is located.

A. A homestead may be abandoned by any of the following:

1. A declaration of abandonment or waiver.

2. A transfer of the homestead property by deed of conveyance or contract for conveyance.

#### Section 33-1105. Sale by judgment creditor of property subject to homestead exemption

A judgment creditor other than a mortgagee or beneficiary under a trust deed may elect to sell by judicial sale as specified in title 12 the property in which the judgment debtor has a homestead under section 33-1101, subsection A, provided that the judgment debtor's interest in the property shall exceed the sum of the judgment debtor's homestead plus the amount of any consensual liens on the property having priority to the judgment. A bid shall not be accepted by the officer in charge of a sale under this section which does not exceed the amount of the judgment debtor's homestead plus the amount of any consensual liens on the property having a priority to the judgment plus the costs of the sale allowable under title 12. After receipt of a sufficient bid, the officer shall sell the property.

The remaining proceeds shall be applied in accordance with the provisions of section 12-1562, subsection A.

B. If units may be added to or withdrawn from the condominium, the declaration must state the formulas to be used to reallocate the allocated interests among all units included in the condominium after the addition or withdrawal.

C. The declaration may provide:

1. That different allocations of votes shall be made to the units on particular matters specified in the declaration.

2. For cumulative voting only for the purpose of electing members of the board of directors.

3. For class voting on specified issues affecting the class if necessary to protect valid interests of the class.

D. Except for minor variations due to rounding, the sum of the undivided interests in the common elements and common expense liabilities allocated at any time to all the units must each equal one if stated as fractions or one hundred per cent if stated as percentages. If a discrepancy exists between an allocated interest and the result derived from application of the pertinent formula, the allocated interest prevails.

E. Except as otherwise permitted by the provisions of this chapter, the common elements are not subject to partition, and any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale or other voluntary or involuntary transfer of an undivided interest in the common elements made without the unit to which that interest is allocated is void.

#### Section 33-1218. Limited common elements

A. Except for the limited common elements described in section 33-1212, paragraphs 2 and 4, other than porches, balconies, patios and entryways, the declaration shall specify to which unit or units each limited common element is allocated. The allocation shall not be altered without the consent of the unit owners whose units are affected.

B. Except as the declaration otherwise provides, a limited common element may be reallocated by an amendment to the declaration. The amendment shall be executed by the unit owners between or among whose units the reallocation is made, shall state the manner in which the limited common elements are to be reallocated and, before recording the amendment, shall be submitted to the board of directors. Unless the board of directors determines within thirty days that the proposed amendment is unreasonable, which determination shall be in writing and specifically state the reasons for disapproval, the association shall execute its approval and record the amendment.

C. A common element not previously allocated as a limited common element shall not be so allocated except pursuant to provisions in the declaration. The allocations shall be made by amendments to the declaration.

#### Section 33-1219. Plat

A. The plat is a part of the declaration. The plat must be clear and legible.

B. The plat shall show:

1. The name of the condominium.

2. The boundaries of the condominium and a legal description of the real estate included in the condominium.

3. The extent of any encroachments on any portion of the condominium.

4. To the extent feasible, the location and dimensions of all easements serving or burdening any portion of the condominium.

5. The location and dimensions of the vertical boundaries of each unit, and each unit's identifying number.

6. Any horizontal unit boundaries, with reference to an established datum, and each unit's identifying number.

7. Any units with respect to which the declarant has reserved the right to create additional units or common elements, identified appropriately.

8. The location and dimensions of all real estate subject to the development right of withdrawal identified as such.

9. The location and dimensions of all real estate in which the unit owner will only own an estate for years labeled as a "leasehold condominium".

10. The distance between noncontiguous parcels of real estate comprising the condominium.

11. The location and dimensions of limited common elements, including porches, balconies, patios and entryways, other than the limited common elements described in section 33-1212, paragraphs 2 and 4.

12. Any other matters the declarant deems appropriate.

C. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, the horizontal boundaries of a part of a unit located outside of a building have the same elevation as the horizontal boundaries of the inside part and need not be depicted on the plat.

D. On exercising any development right, the declarant shall record a new plat conforming to the requirements of subsections A and B of this section. No new plat need be recorded if the development right exercised was clearly depicted on the original plat and a document is recorded which references the declaration and original plat and declares that the development right has been exercised.

#### Section 33-1220. Exercise of development rights

A. To exercise a development right the declarant shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration which shall include a new plat conforming to the requirements of section 33-1219, subsections A and B, if the previously recorded plat does not show the boundaries of the parcel or parcels as to which the development right is exercised. The amendment to the declaration shall assign an identifying number to each new unit created and, except in the case of subdivision or conversion of units described in subsection C of this section, reallocate the allocated interests among all units. The amendment shall describe any common elements and any limited common elements created and, in the case of limited common elements, designate the unit to which each is allocated as required by section 33-1218.

B. Development rights may be reserved within any real estate added to the condominium if the amendment adding that real estate includes all matters required by section 33-1215 or 33-1216, whichever is applicable, and the plat includes all matters required by section 33-1219. This subsection does not extend any time limit on the exercise of development rights imposed by the declaration pursuant to section 33-1215, subsection A, paragraph 6.

C. Whenever a declarant exercises a development right to subdivide or convert a unit previously created into additional units or common elements, or both:

1. If the declarant converts the unit entirely to common elements, the amendment to the declaration must reallocate all the allocated interests of that unit among the other units as if that unit had been taken by eminent domain.

2. If the declarant subdivides the unit into two or more units, whether any part of the unit is converted into common elements, the amendment to the declaration shall reallocate all the allocated interests of the unit among the units created by the subdivision in any reasonable manner prescribed by the declarant.

D. If the declaration provides that all or a portion of the real estate is subject to the development right of withdrawal:

1. If all the real estate is subject to withdrawal and the declaration does not describe separate portions of the real estate subject to that right, none of the real estate may be withdrawn after a unit has been conveyed to a purchaser without the written consent of all unit owners in the condominium and any mortgagees or beneficiaries of deeds of trust or sellers under a contract, as defined in section 33-741, for conveyance of real property encumbering the units.

2. If a portion or portions are subject to withdrawal, a portion shall not be withdrawn after a unit in that portion has been conveyed to a purchaser without the written consent of all unit owners in the condominium and any mortgagees or beneficiaries of deeds of trust or sellers under contract, as defined in section 33-741, for conveyance of real property encumbering the units.

E. No development right shall be exercised in any manner which would eliminate or materially reduce in size any tennis court, swimming pool, clubhouse or other recreational facility which is part of the common elements and which was specified in the public report issued on the condominium by the commissioner of the state real estate department, unless the exercise of the development right is approved by an affirmative vote of the unit owners to which at least eighty per cent of the votes in the association are allocated.

#### Section 33-1221. Alterations of units

Subject to the provisions of the declaration and other provisions of law, a unit owner:

1. May make any improvements or alterations to his unit that do not impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems or lessen the support of any portion of the condominium.

2. Shall not change the appearance of the common elements, or the exterior appearance of a unit or any other portion of the condominium, without written permission of the association.

3. After acquiring an adjoining unit or, if the declaration expressly permits, an adjoining part of an adjoining unit, may remove or alter any intervening partition or create apertures in intervening partitions, even if the partition in whole or in part is a common element, if those acts do not impair the structural integrity or mechanical systems or lessen the support of any portion of the condominium. Removal of partitions or creation of apertures under this paragraph is not an alteration of boundaries.

#### Section 33-1222. Relocation of boundaries between adjoining units

If the declaration expressly permits, the boundaries between or among adjoining units may be relocated by an amendment to the declaration. The owners of the units shall prepare an amendment to the declaration, including the plat, that identifies the units involved, specifies the altered boundaries of the units and their dimensions and includes the units' identifying numbers. If the owners of the adjoining units have specified a reallocation between their units of the allocated interests, the amendment shall state the proposed reallocation in a reasonable manner. The amendment shall be executed by the owners of those units, shall contain words of conveyance between or among them and, before recording the amendment, shall be submitted to the board of directors. Unless the board of directors determines within thirty days that the proposed amendment is unreasonable, which determination shall be in writing and specifically state the reasons for disapproval, the association shall execute its approval and record the amendment.

#### Section 33-1223. Subdivision of units

If the declaration expressly permits, a unit may be subdivided into two or more units. A unit owner shall prepare an amendment to the declaration, including the plat, which identifies the unit involved, specifies the boundaries of each unit created and its dimensions, assigns an identifying number to each unit created and allocates the allocated interests formerly allocated to the subdivided unit to the new units in a reasonable manner. The amendment shall be executed by the owner of the unit to be subdivided and, before recording, submitted to the board of directors. Unless the board of directors determines within thirty days that the proposed amendment is unreasonable, which determination shall be in writing and specifically state the reasons for disapproval, the association shall execute its approval and record the amendment.

#### Section 33-1224. Easement for encroachments

To the extent that any unit or common element encroaches on any other unit or common element as a result of original construction, shifting or settling, or alteration or restoration authorized by the declaration, a valid easement for the encroachment exists.

#### Section 33-1225. Use for sale purposes

A declarant may maintain sales offices, management offices and models in units or on common elements in the condominium unless:

1. The declaration provides otherwise.

2. Such use is prohibited by another provision of law or local ordinances.

#### Section 33-1226. Easement to facilitate exercise of special declarant rights

Subject to the provisions of the declaration, a declarant has an easement through the common elements as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of discharging a declarant's obligations or exercising special declarant rights, whether arising under this chapter or reserved in the declaration.

#### Section 33-1227. Amendment of declaration

A. Except in cases of amendments that may be executed by a declarant under section 33-1220, by the association under section 33-1206 or section 33-1216, subsection D, or by certain unit owners under section 33-1218, subsection B, section 33-1222, section 33-1223 or section 33-1228, subsection D, and except to the extent allowed or required by other provisions of this chapter, the declaration, including the plat, may be amended only by a vote of the unit owners to which at least sixty-seven percent of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger majority the declaration specifies. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units are restricted exclusively to nonresidential use. The declaration may also provide that the consent of the declarant is required to an amendment during any period of declarant control pursuant to section 33-1243. Within thirty days after the adoption of any amendment pursuant to this subsection, the association shall prepare, execute and record a written instrument setting forth the amendment.

B. An action to challenge the validity of an amendment adopted by the association pursuant to this section shall not be brought more than one year after the amendment is recorded.

C. An amendment to the declaration shall be recorded in each county in which any portion of the condominium is located and is effective only on recordation in the same manner as required for the declaration under section 33-1211.

D. Except to the extent expressly allowed or required by other provisions of this chapter, an amendment shall not create or increase special declarant rights, increase the number of units or change the boundaries of any unit, the allocated interests of a unit or the uses to which any unit is restricted, in the absence of unanimous consent of the unit owners.

E. An amendment shall not terminate or decrease any unexpired development right, special declarant right or period of declarant control unless the declarant approves.

F. Amendments to the declaration required by this chapter to be executed by the association shall be executed on behalf of the association by any officer of the association designated for that purpose or, in the absence of designation, by the president of the association.

#### Section 33-1228. Termination of condominium

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, a condominium may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which at least eighty percent of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, except:

1. In the case of a taking of all the units by eminent domain.

2. If the declaration specifies a smaller percentage, but only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses.

B. A condominium created on or after September 24, 2022 may be terminated only by agreement of unit owners of units to which ninety-five percent of the votes in the association are allocated, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, except as provided in subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section.

C. At least thirty days before recording a termination agreement, the board of directors of the association shall convene a regular or special meeting of the board of directors at which a person or entity that purports to have the agreement of at least the percentage of the votes in the association specified in subsection A or B of this section, as applicable, or any larger percentage if required, shall produce and make available to the unit owners copies of a signed notarized statement that the owner of a unit has executed a termination agreement.  The person or entity shall produce copies of a statement for each unit owner who has agreed to the termination, or may produce the signed termination agreement that includes a sufficient number of unit owners.  Any meeting called pursuant to this subsection shall be noticed as otherwise provided by law, except that the board may not take action by written consent or any other method that does not provide for an actual meeting that is open to all the unit owners. Any termination agreement that is recorded without full compliance with this subsection is invalid.

D. An agreement to terminate shall be evidenced by the execution or ratifications of a termination agreement, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The termination agreement shall specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless it is recorded before that date. A termination agreement and all ratifications of a termination agreement shall be recorded in each county in which a portion of the condominium is situated and is effective only on recordation.

E. A termination agreement may provide that all the common elements and units of the condominium shall be sold following termination. If, pursuant to the agreement, any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, the termination agreement shall set forth the minimum terms of the sale.

F. The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract for the sale of real estate in the condominium, but the contract is not binding on the unit owners until approved pursuant to subsections A, B, C and D of this section. If any real estate in the condominium is to be sold following termination, title to that real estate on termination vests in the association as trustee for the holders of all interest in the units. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the sale. Until the sale has been concluded and the proceeds of the sale distributed, the association continues in existence with all powers it had before termination. Proceeds of the sale shall be distributed to unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear, in proportion to the respective interests of unit owners as provided in subsection I of this section. Unless otherwise specified in the termination agreement, as long as the association holds title to the real estate, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit owner's unit. During the period of that occupancy, each unit owner and the successors in interest remain liable for all assessments and other obligations imposed on unit owners by this chapter or the declaration.

G. If the real estate constituting the condominium is not to be sold following termination, title to all the real estate in the condominium vests in the unit owners on termination as tenants in common in proportion to their respective interests as provided in subsection I of this section, and liens on the units shift accordingly. While the tenancy in common exists, each unit owner and the unit owner's successors in interest have an exclusive right to occupancy of the portion of the real estate that formerly constituted the unit owner's unit.

H. Following termination of the condominium, the proceeds of any sale of real estate, together with the assets of the association, are held by the association as trustee for unit owners and holders of liens on the units as their interests may appear. Following termination, creditors of the association holding liens on the units that were recorded before termination may enforce those liens in the same manner as any lienholder.

I. The respective interests of unit owners referred to in subsections F, G and H of this section are as follows:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2 of this subsection, the respective interests of unit owners are the fair market values of their units, limited common elements and common element interests immediately before the termination, their pro rata share of any monies in the association's reserve fund and the operating account and an additional five percent of that total amount for relocation costs. An independent appraiser selected by the association shall determine the total fair market values. The determination of the independent appraiser shall be distributed to the unit owners and becomes final unless disapproved within sixty days after distribution to the unit owner. Any unit owner may obtain a second independent appraisal at the unit owner's expense and, if the unit owner's independent appraisal amount differs from the association's independent appraisal amount by five percent or less, the higher appraisal is final. If the total amount of compensation owed as determined by the second appraiser is more than five percent higher than the amount determined by the association's appraiser, the unit owner shall submit to arbitration by an arbitrator affiliated with a national arbitration association and under the rules of that association at the association's expense and the arbitration amount is the final sale amount. As part of the arbitration process, the appraisers shall fully disclose their appraisal methodologies and shall disclose any other transaction occurring between the buyer and the sellers. An additional five percent of the final sale amount shall be added for relocation costs.

2. If any unit or any limited common element is destroyed to the extent that an appraisal of the fair market value of the unit or element before destruction cannot be made, the interests of all unit owners are their respective common element interests immediately before the termination.

J. Except as provided in subsection K of this section, foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against the entire condominium does not of itself terminate the condominium, and foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the condominium does not withdraw that portion from the condominium. Foreclosure or enforcement of a lien or encumbrance against withdrawable real estate does not of itself withdraw that real estate from the condominium, but the person taking title may require from the association, on request, an amendment excluding the real estate from the condominium.

K. If a lien or encumbrance against a portion of the real estate comprising the condominium has priority over the declaration, and the lien or encumbrance has not been partially released, the parties foreclosing the lien or encumbrance, on foreclosure, may record an instrument excluding the real estate subject to that lien or encumbrance from the condominium.

L. The provisions of subsections E, F, G, H, J and K of this section do not apply if the original declaration, an amendment to the original declaration recorded before the conveyance of any unit to an owner other than the declarant or an agreement by all of the unit owners contains provisions inconsistent with these subsections.

M. Beginning on August 3, 2018, any provisions in the declaration that conflict with subsection I, paragraph 1 of this section are void as a matter of public policy.

#### Section 33-1229. Rights of secured lenders

The declaration may require that all or a specified number or percentage of the mortgagees, beneficiaries of deeds of trust or sellers under contracts, as defined in section 33-741, for conveyance of real property encumbering the units approve specified actions of the unit owners or the association as a condition to the effectiveness of those actions, but requirement for approval shall not operate to either:

1. Deny or delegate control over the general administrative affairs of the association by the unit owners or the board of directors.

2. Prevent the association or the board of directors from commencing, intervening in or settling any litigation or proceeding, or receiving and distributing any insurance proceeds pursuant to section 33-1253.

#### Section 33-1230. Merger or consolidation of condominiums

A. Any two or more condominiums, by agreement of the unit owners as provided in subsection B, may be merged or consolidated into a single condominium. In the event of a merger or consolidation, unless the agreement otherwise provides, the resultant condominium is, for all purposes, the legal successor of all of the preexisting condominiums and the operations and activities of all associations of the preexisting condominiums shall be merged or consolidated into a single association which shall hold all powers, rights, obligations, assets and liabilities of all preexisting associations.

B. An agreement of two or more condominiums to merge or consolidate pursuant to subsection A shall be evidenced by an agreement prepared, executed, recorded and certified by the president of the association of each of the preexisting condominiums following approval by owners of units to which are allocated the percentage of votes in each condominium required to terminate that condominium. Any such agreement shall be recorded in each county in which a portion of the condominium is located and is not effective until recorded. A merger or consolidation of two or more condominiums shall be considered an amendment to the declaration of each of the condominiums merged or consolidated.

C. Every merger or consolidation agreement shall provide for the reallocation of the allocated interests in the new association among the units of the resultant condominium either by stating:

1. The reallocations or the formulas on which they are based.

2. The percentage of overall allocated interests of the new condominium which are allocated to all of the units comprising each of the preexisting condominiums, and providing that the portion of the percentages allocated to each unit formerly comprising a part of the preexisting condominium must be equal to the percentages of allocated interests allocated to that unit by the declaration of the preexisting condominiums.

### Article 3 - Management of the Condominium

#### Section 33-1241. Organization of unit owners' association

A unit owners' association shall be organized no later than the date the first unit in the condominium is conveyed. The membership of the association at all times shall consist exclusively of all the unit owners or, following termination of the condominium, of all former unit owners entitled to distributions of proceeds under section 33-1228, or their heirs, successors or assigns. The association shall be organized as a profit or nonprofit corporation or as an unincorporated association.

10. Impose and receive any payments, fees or charges for the use, rental or operation of the common elements other than limited common elements described in section 33-1212, paragraphs 2 and 4 and for services provided to unit owners.

Impose charges for late payment of assessments after the association has provided notice that the assessment is overdue or provided notice that the assessment is considered overdue after a certain date and, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, impose reasonable monetary penalties on unit owners for violations of the declaration, bylaws and rules of the association.

12. Impose reasonable charges for the preparation and recordation of amendments to the declaration or statements of unpaid assessments.

13. Provide for the indemnification of its officers and executive board of directors and maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance.

C. Within ten business days after receipt of the certified mail containing the response from the unit owner, the association shall respond to the unit owner with a written explanation regarding the notice that shall provide at least the following information unless previously provided in the notice of violation:

1. The provision of the condominium documents that has allegedly been violated.

2. The date of the violation or the date the violation was observed.

3. The first and last name of the person or persons who observed the violation.

D. Unless the information required in subsection C, paragraph 4 of this section is provided in the notice of violation, the association shall not proceed with any action to enforce the condominium documents, including the collection of attorney fees, before or during the time prescribed by subsection C of this section regarding the exchange of information between the association and the unit owner and shall give the unit owner written notice of the unit owner's option to petition for an administrative hearing on the matter in the state real estate department pursuant to section  32-2199.01.  At any time before or after completion of the exchange of information pursuant to this section, the unit owner may petition for a hearing pursuant to section 32-2199.01 if the dispute is within the jurisdiction of the state real estate department as prescribed in section 32-2199.01.

 

#### Section 33-1243. Board of directors and officers; conflict; powers; limitations; removal; annual audit; applicability

A. Except as provided in the declaration, the bylaws, subsection B of this section or other provisions of this chapter, the board of directors may act in all instances on behalf of the association.

B. The board of directors shall not act on behalf of the association to amend the declaration, terminate the condominium, elect members of the board of directors or determine the qualifications, powers and duties or terms of office of board of directors members.  Except as provided in subsection H of this section, the board of directors may fill vacancies in its membership for the unexpired portion of any term.

C. If any contract, decision or other action for compensation taken by or on behalf of the board of directors would benefit any member of the board of directors or any person who is a parent, grandparent, spouse, child or sibling of a member of the board of directors or a parent or spouse of any of those persons, that member of the board of directors shall declare a conflict of interest for that issue.  The member shall declare the conflict in an open meeting of the board before the board discusses or takes action on that issue and that member may then vote on that issue.  Any contract entered into in violation of this subsection is void and unenforceable.

D. Except as provided in the declaration, within thirty days after adoption of any proposed budget for the condominium, the board of directors shall provide a summary of the budget to all the unit owners.  Unless the board of directors is expressly authorized in the declaration to adopt and amend budgets from time to time, any budget or amendment shall be ratified by the unit owners in accordance with the procedures set forth in this subsection. If ratification is required, the board of directors shall set a date for a meeting of the unit owners to consider ratification of the budget not fewer than fourteen nor more than thirty days after mailing of the summary.  Unless at that meeting a majority of all the unit owners or any larger vote specified in the declaration rejects the budget, the budget is ratified, whether or not a quorum is present.  If the proposed budget is rejected, the periodic budget last ratified by the unit owners shall be continued until such time as the unit owners ratify a subsequent budget proposed by the board of directors.

E. The declaration may provide for a period of declarant control of the association, during which period a declarant or persons designated by the declarant may appoint and remove the officers and members of the board of directors. Regardless of the period provided in the declaration, a period of declarant control terminates no later than the earlier of:

1. Ninety days after conveyance of seventy-five percent of the units that may be created to unit owners other than a declarant.

2. Four years after all declarants have ceased to offer units for sale in the ordinary course of business.

F. A declarant may voluntarily surrender the right to appoint and remove officers and members of the board of directors before termination of the period prescribed in subsection E of this section, but in that event the declarant may require, for the duration of the period of declarant control, that specified actions of the association or board of directors, as described in a recorded instrument executed by the declarant, be approved by the declarant before they become effective.

G. Not later than the termination of any period of declarant control the unit owners shall elect a board of directors of at least three members, at least a majority of whom must be unit owners.  The board of directors shall elect the officers.  The board members and officers shall take office on election.

H. Notwithstanding any provision of the declaration or bylaws to the contrary, all of the following apply to a meeting at which a member of the board of directors, other than a member appointed by the declarant, is proposed to be removed from the board of directors:

1. The unit owners who are eligible to vote at the time of the meeting may remove any member of the board of directors, other than a member appointed by the declarant, by a majority vote of those voting on the matter at a meeting of the unit owners.

2. The meeting of the unit owners shall be called pursuant to this section and action may be taken only if a quorum is present.

3. The unit owners may remove any member of the board of directors with or without cause, other than a member appointed by the declarant.

4. For purposes of calling for removal of a member of the board of directors, other than a member appointed by the declarant, the following apply:

(a) In an association with one thousand or fewer members, on receipt of a petition that calls for removal of a member of the board of directors and that is signed by the number of persons who are eligible to vote in the association at the time the person signs the petition equal to at least twenty-five percent of the votes in the association or by the number of persons who are eligible to vote in the association at the time the person signs the petition equal to at least one hundred votes in the association, whichever is less, the board shall call and provide written notice of a special meeting of the association as prescribed by section 33-1248, subsection B.

(b) Notwithstanding section 33-1248, subsection B, in an association with more than one thousand members, on receipt of a petition that calls for removal of a member of the board of directors and that is signed by the number of persons who are eligible to vote in the association at the time the person signs the petition equal to at least ten percent of the votes in the association or by the number of persons who are eligible to vote in the association at the time the person signs the petition equal to at least one thousand votes in the association, whichever is less, the board shall call and provide written notice of a special meeting of the association.  The board shall provide written notice of a special meeting as prescribed by section 33-1248, subsection B.

(c) The special meeting shall be called, noticed and held within thirty days after receipt of the petition.

(d) For purposes of a special meeting called pursuant to this subsection, a quorum is present if the number of owners who are eligible to vote in the association at the time the person attends the meeting equal to at least twenty percent of the votes of the association or the number of persons who are eligible to vote in the association at the time the person attends the meeting equal to at least one thousand votes, whichever is less, is present at the meeting in person or as otherwise permitted by law.

(e) If a civil action is filed regarding the removal of a board member, the prevailing party in the civil action shall be awarded its reasonable attorney fees and costs.

(g) A petition that calls for the removal of the same member of the board of directors shall not be submitted more than once during each term of office for that member.

5. On removal of at least one but fewer than a majority of the members of the board of directors at a special meeting of the membership called pursuant to this subsection, the vacancies shall be filled as provided in the condominium documents.

6. On removal of a majority of the members of the board of directors at a special meeting of the membership called pursuant to this subsection, or if the condominium documents do not provide a method for filling board vacancies, the association shall hold an election for the replacement of the removed directors at a separate meeting of the members of the association that is held not later than thirty days after the meeting at which the members of the board of directors were removed.

7. A member of the board of directors who is removed pursuant to this subsection is not eligible to serve on the board of directors again until after the expiration of the removed board member's term of office, unless the condominium documents specifically provide for a longer period of ineligibility.

I. For an association in which board members are elected from separately designated voting districts, a member of the board of directors, other than a member appointed by the declarant, may be removed only by a vote of the members from that voting district, and only the members from that voting district are eligible to vote on the matter or be counted for purposes of determining a quorum.

J. Unless any provision in the condominium documents requires an annual audit by a certified public accountant, the board of directors shall provide for an annual financial audit, review or compilation of the association.  The audit, review or compilation shall be completed no later than one hundred eighty days after the end of the association's fiscal year and shall be made available on request to the unit owners within thirty days after its completion.

B. On transfer of any special declarant right, the liability of a transferor declarant is as follows:

1. A transferor is not relieved of any obligation or liability arising before the transfer.

D. The liabilities and obligations of a person who succeeds to special declarant rights are as follows:

1. A successor to any special declarant right, other than a successor described in paragraph 2 of this subsection, is subject to all liabilities and obligations imposed by this chapter or the declaration:

1. Any management contract or employment contract.

2. Any other contract or lease between the association and a declarant or an affiliate of a declarant.

3. Any contract or lease that is not bona fide or was unconscionable to the unit owners at the time entered into under the circumstances then prevailing.

On reasonable notice, each unit owner shall afford to the association and the other unit owners, and to their agents or employees, access through the unit reasonably necessary for those purposes. If damage is inflicted on the common elements or any unit through which access is taken, the unit owner responsible for the damage, or the association if it is responsible, is liable for the prompt repair of the damage.

B. For any residential rental units that have been declared a slum property by the city or town pursuant to section 33-1905 and that are in the condominium complex, the association is responsible for enforcing any requirement for a licensed property management firm that is imposed by a city or town pursuant to section 33-1906.

C. In addition to the liability borne by the declarant as a unit  owner under this chapter, the declarant alone is liable for the maintenance, repair and replacement of any portion of the common elements which the declarant reserves the right to withdraw from the condominium, as long as the unit owner maintains that right.

 

#### Section 33-1248. Open meetings; exceptions

A. Notwithstanding any provision in the declaration, bylaws or other documents to the contrary, all meetings of the unit owners' association and the board of directors, and any regularly scheduled committee meetings, are open to all members of the association or any person designated by a member in writing as the member's representative and all members or designated representatives so desiring shall be permitted to attend and speak at an appropriate time during the deliberations and proceedings. The board may place reasonable time restrictions on those persons speaking during the meeting but shall permit a member or a member's designated representative to speak once after the board has discussed a specific agenda item but before the board takes formal action on that item in addition to any other opportunities to speak. The board shall provide for a reasonable number of persons to speak on each side of an issue. Persons attending may audiotape or videotape those portions of the meetings of the board of directors and meetings of the members that are open. The board of directors of the association shall not require advance notice of the audiotaping or videotaping and may adopt reasonable rules governing the audiotaping or videotaping of open portions of the meetings of the board and the membership, but such rules shall not preclude such audiotaping or videotaping by those attending, unless the board audiotapes or videotapes the meeting and makes the unedited audiotapes or videotapes available to members on request without restrictions on its use as evidence in any dispute resolution process. Any portion of a meeting may be closed only if that portion of the meeting is limited to consideration of one or more of the following:

1. Legal advice from an attorney for the board or the association. On final resolution of any matter for which the board received legal advice or that concerned pending or contemplated litigation, the board may disclose information about that matter in an open meeting except for matters that are required to remain confidential by the terms of a settlement agreement or judgment.

2. Pending or contemplated litigation.

3. Personal, health or financial information about an individual member of the association, an individual employee of the association or an individual employee of a contractor for the association, including records of the association directly related to the personal, health or financial information about an individual member of the association, an individual employee of the association or an individual employee of a contractor for the association.

4. Matters relating to the job performance of, compensation of, health records of or specific complaints against an individual employee of the association or an individual employee of a contractor of the association who works under the direction of the association.

5. Discussion of a unit owner's appeal of any violation cited or penalty imposed by the association except on request of the affected unit owner that the meeting be held in an open session.

B. Notwithstanding any provision in the condominium documents, all meetings of the unit owners' association and the board shall be held in this state.  A meeting of the unit owners' association shall be held at least once each year. Special meetings of the unit owners' association may be called by the president, by a majority of the board of directors or by unit owners having at least twenty-five percent, or any lower percentage specified in the bylaws, of the votes in the association. Not fewer than ten nor more than fifty days in advance of any meeting of the unit owners, the secretary shall cause notice to be hand delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to the mailing address of each unit or to any other mailing address designated in writing by the unit owner. The notice of any meeting of the unit owners shall state the date, time and place of the meeting. The notice of any annual, regular or special meeting of the unit owners shall also state the purpose for which the meeting is called, including the general nature of any proposed amendment to the declaration or bylaws, any changes in assessments that require approval of the unit owners and any proposal to remove a director or officer. The failure of any unit owner to receive actual notice of a meeting of the unit owners does not affect the validity of any action taken at that meeting.

C. Before entering into any closed portion of a meeting of the board of directors, or on notice of a meeting under subsection D of this section that will be closed, the board shall identify the paragraph under subsection A of this section that authorizes the board to close the meeting.

D. Notwithstanding any provision in the declaration, bylaws or other condominium documents, for meetings of the board of directors that are held after the termination of declarant control of the association, notice to unit owners of meetings of the board of directors shall be given at least forty-eight hours in advance of the meeting by newsletter, conspicuous posting or any other reasonable means as determined by the board of directors. An affidavit of notice by an officer of the association is prima facie evidence that notice was given as prescribed by this section.  Notice to unit owners of meetings of the board of directors is not required if emergency circumstances require action by the board before notice can be given. Any notice of a board meeting shall state the date, time and place of the meeting. The failure of any unit owner to receive actual notice of a meeting of the board of directors does not affect the validity of any action taken at that meeting.

E. Notwithstanding any provision in the declaration, bylaws or other condominium documents, for meetings of the board of directors that are held after the termination of declarant control of the association, all of the following apply:

1. The agenda shall be available to all unit owners attending.

2. An emergency meeting of the board of directors may be called to discuss business or take action that cannot be delayed for the forty-eight hours required for notice. At any emergency meeting called by the board of directors, the board of directors may act only on emergency matters. The minutes of the emergency meeting shall state the reason necessitating the emergency meeting.  The minutes of the emergency meeting shall be read and approved at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors.

3. A quorum of the board of directors may meet by means of a telephone conference if a speakerphone is available in the meeting room that allows board members and unit owners to hear all parties who are speaking during the meeting.

4. Any quorum of the board of directors that meets informally to discuss association business, including workshops, shall comply with the open meeting and notice provisions of this section without regard to whether the board votes or takes any action on any matter at that informal meeting.

F. It is the policy of this state as reflected in this section that all meetings of a condominium, whether meetings of the unit owners' association or meetings of the board of directors of the association, be conducted openly and that notices and agendas be provided for those meetings that contain the information that is reasonably necessary to inform the unit owners of the matters to be discussed or decided and to ensure that unit owners have the ability to speak after discussion of agenda items, but before a vote of the board of directors or members is taken.  Toward this end, any person or entity that is charged with the interpretation of these provisions, including members of the board or directors and any community manager, shall take into account this declaration of policy and shall construe any provision of this section in favor of open meetings.

G. This section does not apply to timeshare plans or associations that are subject to chapter 20 of this title.

 

#### Section 33-1249. Quorums; applicability

A. Unless the bylaws provide otherwise, a quorum is present throughout any meeting of the association if persons entitled to cast at least twenty-five per cent of the votes in the association are present in person or by proxy at the beginning of the meeting.

B. Unless the bylaws specify a larger percentage, a quorum is deemed present throughout any meeting of the board of directors if persons entitled to cast at least fifty per cent of the votes on that board are present at the beginning of the meeting.

C. This section does not apply to timeshare plans or associations that are subject to chapter 20 of this title.

 

#### Section 33-1250. Voting; proxies; absentee ballots; applicability; definition

A. If only one of the multiple owners of a unit is present at a meeting of the association, the owner is entitled to cast all the votes allocated to that unit.  If more than one of the multiple owners are present, the votes allocated to that unit may be cast only in accordance with the agreement of a majority in interest of the multiple owners unless the declaration expressly provides otherwise.  There is majority agreement if any one of the multiple owners casts the votes allocated to that unit without protest being made promptly to the person presiding over the meeting by any of the other owners of the unit.

B. During the period of declarant control, votes allocated to a unit may be cast pursuant to a proxy duly executed by a unit owner.  If a unit is owned by more than one person, each owner of the unit may vote or register protest to the casting of votes by the other owners of the unit through a duly executed proxy.  A unit owner may not revoke a proxy given pursuant to this section except by actual notice of revocation to the person presiding over a meeting of the association.  A proxy is void if it is not dated or purports to be revocable without notice. The proxy is revoked on presentation of a later dated proxy executed by the same unit owner.  A proxy terminates one year after its date, unless it specifies a shorter term or unless it states that it is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable.

C. Notwithstanding any provision in the condominium documents, after termination of the period of declarant control, votes allocated to a unit may not be cast pursuant to a proxy.  The association shall provide for votes to be cast in person and by absentee ballot and, in addition, the association may provide for voting by some other form of delivery, including the use of e-mail and fax delivery.  Notwithstanding section 10-3708 or the provisions of the condominium documents, any action taken at an annual, regular or special meeting of the members shall comply with all of the following if absentee ballots or ballots provided by some other form of delivery are used:

1. The ballot shall set forth each proposed action.

2. The ballot shall provide an opportunity to vote for or against each proposed action.

3. The ballot is valid for only one specified election or meeting of the members and expires automatically after the completion of the election or meeting.

4. The ballot specifies the time and date by which the ballot must be delivered to the board of directors in order to be counted, which shall be at least seven days after the date that the board delivers the unvoted ballot to the member.

5. The ballot does not authorize another person to cast votes on behalf of the member.

6. The completed ballot shall contain the name, the address and either the actual or electronic signature of the person voting, except that if the condominium documents permit secret ballots, only the envelope shall contain the name, the address and either the actual or electronic signature of the voter.

7. Ballots, envelopes and related materials, including sign-in sheets if used, shall be retained in electronic or paper format and made available for unit owner inspection for at least one year after completion of the election.

D. Votes cast by absentee ballot or other form of delivery, including the use of e-mail and fax delivery, are valid for the purpose of establishing a quorum.

E. Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, an association for a timeshare plan as defined in section 32-2197 may permit votes by a proxy that is duly executed by a unit owner.

F. If the declaration requires that votes on specified matters affecting the condominium be cast by lessees rather than unit owners of leased units all of the following apply:

1. The provisions of subsections A and B of this section apply to lessees as if they were unit owners.

2. Unit owners who have leased their units to other persons shall not cast votes on those specified matters.

3. Lessees are entitled to notice of meetings, access to records and other rights respecting those matters as if they were unit owners.  Unit owners shall also be given notice, in the manner prescribed in section 33-1248, of all meetings at which lessees may be entitled to vote.

G. Unless the declaration provides otherwise, votes allocated to a unit owned by the association shall not be cast.

H. This section does not apply to timeshare plans or associations that are subject to chapter 20 of this title.

I. For the purposes of this section, "period of declarant control" means the time during which the declarant or persons designated by the declarant may elect or appoint the members of the board of directors pursuant to the condominium documents or by virtue of superior voting power.

 

#### Section 33-1251. Tort and contract liability

A. An action alleging a wrong done by the association shall be brought against the association and not against any unit owner.

B. A statute of limitation affecting any right of action of the association against the declarant is tolled until the period of declarant control terminates.

C. A unit owner is not precluded from bringing an action against the association because he is a unit owner or a member or officer of the association.

D. Liens resulting from judgments against the association are governed by section 33-1256.

#### Section 33-1252. Conveyance or encumbrance of common elements

A. Portions of the common elements may be conveyed or subjected to a mortgage, deed of trust or security interest by the association if persons entitled to cast at least eighty per cent of the votes in the association, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to that action in the manner prescribed in subsection B, except that all the owners of units to which any limited common element is allocated must agree in order to convey that limited common element or subject it to a mortgage, deed of trust or security interest. The declaration may specify a smaller percentage only if all of the units in the condominium are restricted exclusively to nonresidential uses. Proceeds of the sale or encumbrance of the common elements are an asset of the association.

B. An agreement to convey common elements or subject them to a mortgage, deed of trust or security interest shall be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications of the agreement, in the same manner as a deed, by the requisite number of unit owners. The agreement shall specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless previously recorded. The agreement and all ratifications of the agreement shall be recorded in each county in which a portion of the condominium is situated and are effective only on recordation.

C. The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract to convey common elements or subject them to a mortgage, deed of trust or security interest, but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved pursuant to subsections A and B. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance or encumbrance, including the power to execute deeds or other instruments.

D. Except as permitted in this chapter, any purported conveyance, encumbrance, judicial sale or other voluntary transfer of common elements is void.

E. A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this section does not deprive any unit of its rights of access and support.

F. A conveyance or encumbrance of common elements pursuant to this section does not affect the priority or validity of preexisting encumbrances.

#### Section 33-1252.01. Conveyance of certain real property

A. Real property that is held as an asset of the association and that is not held as a common element of the condominium may be conveyed by the association if persons entitled to cast at least eighty per cent of the votes in the association, or any larger percentage the declaration specifies, agree to the conveyance in the manner prescribed in subsection B.

B. An agreement to convey real property that is held as an asset of the association and that is not held as a common element of the condominium shall be evidenced by the execution of an agreement, or ratifications of the agreement, in the same manner as a deed and by the requisite number of unit owners.  The agreement shall specify a date after which the agreement will be void unless previously recorded.  The agreement and all ratifications of the agreement shall be recorded in each county in which a portion of the condominium is situated and are effective only on recordation.

C. The association, on behalf of the unit owners, may contract to convey the real property but the contract is not enforceable against the association until approved pursuant to subsections A and B. Thereafter, the association has all powers necessary and appropriate to effect the conveyance, including the power to execute deeds or other instruments.

D. Except as permitted in this chapter, any purported conveyance or other voluntary transfer of real property is void.

E. A conveyance of real property pursuant to this section does not affect the priority or validity of preexisting encumbrances.

F. Property an association acquires in an assessment lien foreclosure action shall not be considered real property held as an asset of the association for the purpose of this section.

 

#### Section 33-1253. Insurance

A. Commencing not later than the time of the first conveyance of a unit to a person other than a declarant, the association shall maintain, to the extent reasonably available, both:

1. Property insurance on the common elements insuring against all risks of direct physical loss commonly insured against or, as determined by the board of directors against fire and extended coverage perils. The total amount of insurance after application of any deductibles shall be not less than eighty per cent of the actual cash value of the insured property at the time the insurance is purchased and at each renewal date, exclusive of land, excavations, foundations and other items normally excluded from property policies.

2. Liability insurance in an amount determined by the board of directors but not less than any amount specified in the declaration, covering all occurrences commonly insured against for death, bodily injury and property damage arising out of or in connection with the use, ownership or maintenance of the common elements.

B. To the extent available, the insurance maintained under subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, if determined by the board, includes the units or any portion of those units but need not include improvements and betterments installed by unit owners or the personal property of unit owners.

C. If the insurance described in subsection A of this section is not reasonably available, the association promptly shall cause notice of that fact to be hand-delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to all unit owners. The declaration may require the association to carry any other insurance, and the association in any event may carry any other insurance it deems appropriate to protect the association or the unit owners.

D. Insurance policies carried pursuant to subsection A of this section shall provide the following:

1. Each unit owner is an insured person under the policy with respect to liability arising out of his interest in the common elements or membership in the association.

2. The insurer waives its right to subrogation under the policy against any unit owner or members of his household.

3. No act or omission by any unit owner, unless acting within the scope of his authority on behalf of the association, will void the policy or be a condition to recovery under the policy.

4. If, at the time of a loss under the policy, there is other insurance in the name of a unit owner covering the same property covered by the policy, the association's policy provides primary insurance.

E. Any loss covered by the property policy under subsection A, paragraph 1 and subsection B of this section shall be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss are payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lienholders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of subsection H of this section, the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged property, and unit owners and lienholders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the property has been completely repaired or restored, or the condominium is terminated.

F. An insurance policy issued to the association does not prevent a unit owner from obtaining insurance for his own benefit.

G. An insurer that has issued an insurance policy under this section shall issue certificates or memoranda of insurance to the association and, on written request, to any unit owner, mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust. The insurer issuing the policy shall not cancel or refuse to renew it until thirty days after notice of the proposed cancellation or nonrenewal has been mailed to the association, each unit owner and each mortgagee or beneficiary under a deed of trust to whom a certificate or memorandum of insurance has been issued at their respective last known addresses.

H. Any portion of the condominium for which insurance is required under this section which is damaged or destroyed shall be repaired or replaced promptly by the association unless any of the following apply:

1. The condominium is terminated.

2. Repair or replacement would be illegal under any state or local health or safety statute or ordinance.

3. Eighty per cent of the unit owners, including every owner of a unit or allocated limited common element which will not be rebuilt, vote not to rebuild.

I. The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense. If the entire condominium is not repaired or replaced:

1. The insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements in proportion to their common element interests or as otherwise provided in the declaration shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium.

2. The insurance proceeds attributable to units and allocated limited common elements which are not rebuilt shall be distributed in proportion to their common element interests or as otherwise provided in the declaration to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were allocated, or to lienholders as their interests may appear.

3. The remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners or lienholders as their interests may appear in proportion to the common element interests of all the units.

J. If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's allocated interests are automatically reallocated on the vote as if the unit had been condemned under section 33-1206, subsection A, and the association promptly shall prepare, execute and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations.

K. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections H, I and J of this section, section 33-1228 governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the condominium is terminated.

L. If all units are restricted to nonresidential use, the provisions of a subsection or paragraph of this section do not apply if the declaration, articles of incorporation or amended bylaws contain provisions inconsistent with such subsection or paragraph.

M. This section does not prohibit the declaration from requiring additional or greater amounts of insurance coverage or does not prohibit the board of directors from acquiring additonal or greater amounts of coverage as it reasonably deems appropriate.

#### Section 33-1254. Surplus monies

Unless otherwise provided in the declaration, any surplus monies of the association remaining after payment of or provision for common expenses and any prepayment of reserves shall be paid to the unit owners in proportion to their common expense liabilities or credited to them to reduce their future common expense assessments.

#### Section 33-1255. Assessments for common expenses; applicability

A. Until the association makes a common expense assessment, the declarant shall pay all common expenses. After any assessment has been made by the association, assessments shall be made at least annually, based on a budget adopted at least annually by the association.

B. Except for assessments under subsections C, D, E and F of this section, all common expenses shall be assessed against all the units in accordance with the allocations set forth in the declaration pursuant to section 33-1217, subsection A.  Any past due common expense assessment or installment bears interest at the rate established by the board subject to the condominium documents.

C. Unless otherwise provided for in the declaration all of the following apply:

1. Any common expense associated with the maintenance, repair or replacement of a limited common element shall be equally assessed against the units to which the limited common element is assigned.

2. Any common expense or portion of a common expense benefitting fewer than all of the units shall be assessed exclusively against the units benefitted.

D. Assessments to pay a judgment against the association may be made only against the units in the condominium at the time the judgment was entered, in proportion to their common expense liabilities.

E. If any common expense is caused by the misconduct of any unit owner, the association may assess that expense exclusively against that unit.

F. If the declaration so provides, the common expense assessment for any unit on which construction has not been substantially completed may be an amount which is not less than twenty-five per cent of the common expense assessment for units which have been substantially completed.  However, this reduced common expense assessment shall not be permitted, unless the declarant is obligated under the declaration to pay to the association any deficiency in monies due to the declarant having paid a reduced common assessment and necessary for the association to be able to timely pay all common expenses.

G. If common expense liabilities are reallocated, common expense assessments and any installment on the assessments not yet due shall be recalculated in accordance with the reallocated common expense liabilities.

H. This section does not apply to timeshare plans or associations that are subject to chapter 20 of this title.

 

#### Section 33-1256. Lien for assessments; priority; mechanics' and materialmen's liens; notice; applicability

A. The association has a lien on a unit for any assessment levied against that unit from the time the assessment becomes due. The association's lien for assessments, for charges for late payment of those assessments, for reasonable collection fees and for reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments may be foreclosed in the same manner as a mortgage on real estate but may be foreclosed only if the owner has been delinquent in the payment of monies secured by the lien, excluding reasonable collection fees, reasonable attorney fees and charges for late payment of and costs incurred with respect to those assessments, for a period of one year or in the amount of $1,200 or more, whichever occurs first, as determined on the date the action is filed. Fees, charges, late charges, monetary penalties and interest charged pursuant to section 33-1242, subsection A, paragraphs 10, 11 and 12, other than charges for late payment of assessments, are not enforceable as assessments under this section.  If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first installment of the assessment becomes due.  The association has a lien for fees, charges, late charges, other than charges for late payment of assessments, monetary penalties or interest charged pursuant to section 33-1242, subsection A, paragraphs 10, 11 and 12 after the entry of a judgment in a civil suit for those fees, charges, late charges, monetary penalties or interest from a court of competent jurisdiction and the recording of that judgment in the office of the county recorder as otherwise provided by law. The association's lien for monies other than for assessments, for charges for late payment of those assessments, for reasonable collection fees and for reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments may not be foreclosed and is effective only on conveyance of any interest in the real property.

B. A lien for assessments, for charges for late payment of those assessments, for reasonable collection fees and for reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments under this section is prior to all other liens, interests and encumbrances on a unit except:

1. Liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the declaration.

2. A recorded first mortgage on the unit, a seller's interest in a first contract for sale pursuant to chapter 6, article 3 of this title on the unit recorded prior to the lien arising pursuant to subsection A of this section or a recorded first deed of trust on the unit.

3. Liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit.

C. Subsection B of this section does not affect the priority of mechanics' or materialmen's liens or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association. The lien under this section is not subject to chapter 8 of this title.

D. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same real estate, those liens have equal priority.

E. Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien for assessments, for charges for late payment of those assessments, for reasonable collection fees and for reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments.  Further recordation of any claim of lien for assessments under this section is not required.

F. A lien for unpaid assessments is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within six years after the full amount of the assessments becomes due.

G. This section does not prohibit:

1. Actions to recover sums for which subsection A of this section creates a lien.

2. An association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.

H. A judgment or decree in any action brought under this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney fees for the prevailing party.

I. The association on written request shall furnish to a lienholder, escrow agent, unit owner or person designated by a unit owner a statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments against the unit. The statement shall be furnished within ten days after receipt of the request and the statement is binding on the association, the board of directors and every unit owner if the statement is requested by an escrow agency that is licensed pursuant to title 6, chapter 7.  Failure to provide the statement to the escrow agent within the time provided for in this subsection extinguishes any lien for any unpaid assessment then due.

J. Notwithstanding any provision in the condominium documents or in any contract between the association and a management company, unless the unit owner directs otherwise, all payments received on a unit owner's account shall be applied first to any unpaid assessments, unpaid charges for late payment of those assessments, unpaid reasonable collection fees and unpaid attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments, in that order, with any remaining amounts applied next to other unpaid fees, charges and monetary penalties or interest and late charges on any of those amounts.

K. For a delinquent account for unpaid assessments or for charges related to unpaid assessments, the association shall provide the following written notice to the unit owner at the unit owner's address as provided to the association at least thirty days before authorizing an attorney, or a collection agency that is not acting as the association's managing agent, to begin collection activity on behalf of the association:

Your account is delinquent. If you do not bring your account current or make arrangements that are approved by the association to bring your account current within thirty days after the date of this notice, your account will be turned over for further collection proceedings. Such collection proceedings could include bringing a foreclosure action against your property.

The notice shall be in boldfaced type or all capital letters and shall include the contact information for the person that the unit owner may contact to discuss payment. The notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and may be included within other correspondence sent to the unit owner regarding the unit owner's delinquent account.

L. Beginning January 1, 2020, except for condominiums that have fewer than fifty units and that do not contract with a third party to perform management services on behalf of the association, the association shall provide a statement of account in lieu of a periodic payment book to the unit owner with the same frequency that assessments are provided for in the declaration. The statement of account shall include the current account balance due and the immediately preceding ledger history.  If the association offers the statement of account by electronic means, a unit owner may opt to receive the statement electronically.  The association may stop providing any further statements of account to a unit owner if collection activity begins by an attorney, or a collection agency that is not acting as the association's managing agent, regarding that unit owner's unpaid account.  After collection activity begins, a unit owner may request statements of account by written request to the attorney or collection agency.  Any request by a unit owner for a statement of account after collection activity begins by an attorney or a collection agency that is not acting as the association's managing agent must be fulfilled by the attorney or the collection agency responsible for the collection.  The statement of account provided by the attorney or collection agency responsible for the collection shall include all amounts claimed to be owing to resolve the delinquency through the date set forth in the statement, including attorney fees and costs, regardless of whether such amounts have been reduced to judgment.

M. An agent for the association may collect on behalf of the association directly from a unit owner the assessments and other amounts owed by cash or check, by mailed or hand-delivered bank drafts, checks, cashier's checks or money orders, by credit, charge or debit card or by other electronic means.  For any form of payment other than for cash or for mailed or hand-delivered bank drafts, checks, cashier's checks or money orders, the agent may charge a convenience fee to the unit owner that is approximately the amount charged to the agent by a third-party service provider.

N. This section does not apply to timeshare plans or associations that are subject to chapter 20 of this title.

#### Section 33-1257. Other liens affecting the condominium

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, a legally recorded judgment for money against the association is not a lien on the common elements but is a lien in favor of the judgment lienholder against all of the units in the condominium at the time the judgment was entered.  Other property of a unit owner is not subject to the claims of creditors of the association.

B. If the association has granted a mortgage, deed of trust or security interest in the common elements to a creditor of the association pursuant to section 33-1252, the holder of that security interest must exercise its right against the common elements before its judgment lien on any unit may be enforced.

C. Whether perfected before or after the creation of the condominium, if a lien other than a deed of trust or mortgage becomes effective against two or more units, the unit owner of an affected unit may pay to the lienholder the amount of the lien attributable to his unit, and the lienholder, on receipt of payment, shall promptly deliver a release of the lien covering that unit. The amount of the payment shall be proportionate to the ratio which that unit owner's common expense liability bears to the common expense liabilities of all unit owners whose units are subject to the lien. After payment, the association shall not assess or have a lien against that unit owner's unit for any portion of the common expenses incurred in connection with that lien.

D. A judgment against the association shall be indexed in the name of the condominium and the association and shall include the legal description of the unit subject to the lien. When so indexed, the judgment is notice of the lien against the units.

#### Section 33-1258. Association financial and other records; applicability

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, all financial and other records of the association shall be made reasonably available for examination by any member or any person designated by the member in writing as the member's representative.  The association shall not charge a member or any person designated by the member in writing for making material available for review.  The association shall have ten business days to fulfill a request for examination.  On request for purchase of copies of records by any member or any person designated by the member in writing as the member's representative, the association shall have ten business days to provide copies of the requested records.  An association may charge a fee for making copies of not more than fifteen cents per page.

B. Books and records kept by or on behalf of the association and the board may be withheld from disclosure to the extent that the portion withheld relates to any of the following:

1. Privileged communication between an attorney for the association and the association.

2. Pending litigation.

3. Meeting minutes or other records of a session of a board meeting that is not required to be open to all members pursuant to section 33-1248.

4. Personal, health or financial records of an individual member of the association, an individual employee of the association or an individual employee of a contractor for the association, including records of the association directly related to the personal, health or financial information about an individual member of the association, an individual employee of the association or an individual employee of a contractor for the association.

5. Records relating to the job performance of, compensation of, health records of or specific complaints against an individual employee of the association or an individual employee of a contractor of the association who works under the direction of the association.

C. The association shall not be required to disclose financial and other records of the association if disclosure would violate any state or federal law.

D. This section does not apply to an association for a timeshare plan that is subject to chapter 20 of this title.

 

#### Section 33-1259. Association as trustee

With respect to a third person dealing with the association in the association's capacity as a trustee, the existence of trust powers and their proper exercise by the association may be assumed without inquiry. A third person is not bound to inquire whether the association has power to act as trustee or is properly exercising trust powers. A third person, without actual knowledge that the association is exceeding or improperly exercising its powers, is fully protected in dealing with the association as if it possessed and properly exercised the powers it purports to exercise. A third person is not bound to assure the proper application of trust assets paid or delivered to the association in its capacity as trustee.

#### Section 33-1260. Resale of units; information required; fees; civil penalty; applicability; definition

(d) The total amount of money held by the association as reserves.

(f) If the statement is being furnished by the unit owner, a statement as to whether the unit owner has any knowledge of any alterations or improvements to the unit that violate the declaration.

(h) A statement that provides "I hereby acknowledge that the declaration, bylaws and rules of the association constitute a contract between the association and me (the purchaser). By signing this statement, I acknowledge that I have read and understand the association's contract with me (the purchaser).  I also understand that as a matter of Arizona law, if I fail to pay my association assessments, the association may foreclose on my property." The statement shall also include a signature line for the purchaser and shall be returned to the association within fourteen calendar days.

B. A purchaser or seller who is damaged by the failure of the unit owner or the association to disclose the information required by subsection A of this section may pursue all remedies at law or in equity against the unit owner or the association, whichever failed to comply with subsection A of this section, including the recovery of reasonable attorney fees.

C. The association may charge the unit owner a fee of not more than an aggregate of four hundred dollars to compensate the association for the costs incurred in the preparation and delivery of a statement or other documents furnished by the association pursuant to this section for purposes of resale disclosure, lien estoppel and any other services related to the transfer or use of the property. In addition, the association may charge a rush fee of not more than one hundred dollars if the rush services are required to be performed within seventy-two hours after the request for rush services, and may charge a statement or other documents update fee of not more than fifty dollars if thirty days or more have passed since the date of the original disclosure statement or the date the documents were delivered. The association shall make available to any interested party the amount of any fee established from time to time by the association.  If the aggregate fee for purposes of resale disclosure, lien estoppel and any other services related to the transfer or use of a property is less than four hundred dollars on January 1, 2010, the fee may increase at a rate of not more than twenty percent per year based on the immediately preceding fiscal year's amount not to exceed the four hundred dollar aggregate fee. The association may charge the same fee without regard to whether the association is furnishing the statement or other documents in paper or electronic format.

D. The fees prescribed by this section shall be collected no earlier than at the close of escrow and may only be charged once to a unit owner for that transaction between the parties specified in the notice required pursuant to subsection A of this section.  An association shall not charge or collect a fee relating to services for resale disclosure, lien estoppel and any other services related to the transfer or use of a property except as specifically authorized in this section. An association that charges or collects a fee in violation of this section is subject to a civil penalty of not more than one thousand two hundred dollars.

E. This section applies to a managing agent for an association that is acting on behalf of the association.

Failure to provide the information shall not prevent the unit owner from qualifying for the exemption pursuant to this section.

G. This section does not apply to timeshare plans or associations that are subject to chapter 20 of this title.

H. For the purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires, "unit owner" means the seller of the condominium unit title and excludes any real estate salesperson or real estate broker who is licensed under title 32, chapter 20 and who is acting as a salesperson or broker, any escrow agent who is licensed under title 6, chapter 7 and who is acting as an escrow agent and also excludes a trustee of a deed of trust who is selling the property in a trustee's sale pursuant to chapter 6.1 of this title.

B. A unit owner may designate in writing a third party to act as the unit owner's agent with respect to all association matters relating to the rental unit, except for voting in association elections and serving on the board of directors.  The unit owner shall sign the written designation and shall provide a copy of the written designation to the association. On delivery of the written designation, the association is authorized to conduct all association business relating to the unit owner's rental unit through the designated agent. Any notice given by the association to a unit owner's designated agent on any matter relating to the unit owner's rental unit constitutes notice to the unit owner.

C. Notwithstanding any provision in the condominium documents, on rental of a unit an association shall not require a unit owner or a unit owner's agent to disclose any information regarding a tenant other than the name and contact information for any adults occupying the unit, the time period of the lease, including the beginning and ending dates of the tenancy, and a description and the license plate numbers of the tenants' vehicles.  If the condominium is an age restricted condominium, the unit owner, the unit owner's agent or the tenant shall show a government issued identification that bears a photograph and that confirms that the tenant meets the condominium's age restrictions or requirements.

D. On request of an association or its managing agent for the disclosures prescribed in subsection C of this section, the managing agent or, if there is no managing agent, the association may charge a fee of not more than twenty-five dollars, which shall be paid within fifteen days after the postmarked request.  The fee may be charged for each new tenancy for that unit but may not be charged for a renewal of a lease.  Except for the fee permitted by this subsection and fees related to the use of recreational facilities, the association or its managing agent shall not assess, levy or charge a fee or fine or otherwise impose a requirement on a unit owner's rental unit any differently than on an owner-occupied unit in the association.

1. Requiring a unit owner to provide the association with a copy of the tenant's rental application, credit report, lease agreement or rental contract or other personal information except as prescribed by this section.

4. Imposing on a unit owner or managing agent any fee, assessment, penalty or other charge in an amount greater than fifteen dollars for incomplete or late information regarding the information requested pursuant to subsection C of this section

F. Any attempt by an association to exceed the fee, assessment, penalty or other charge authorized by subsection D or E of this section voids the fee, assessment, penalty or other charge authorized by subsection D or E of this section.  This section does not prevent an association from complying with the housing for older persons act of 1995 (P.L. 104–76; 109 Stat. 787).

G. An owner may use a crime free addendum as part of a lease agreement.  This section does not prohibit the owner's use of a crime free addendum.

The size of a sign offering a property for sale, for rent or for lease shall be in conformance with the industry standard size sign, which shall not exceed eighteen by twenty-four inches, and the industry standard size sign rider, which shall not exceed six by twenty-four inches. This subsection applies only to a commercially produced sign and an association may prohibit using signs that are not commercially produced. With respect to real estate for sale, for rent or for lease in the condominium, an association shall not prohibit in any way other than as is specifically authorized by this section or otherwise regulate any of the following:

J. Notwithstanding any provision in the condominium documents, an association may not prohibit or unreasonably restrict a unit owner's ability to peacefully assemble and use common elements of the condominium if done in compliance with reasonable restrictions for the use of that property adopted by the board of directors. An individual unit owner or group of unit owners may assemble to discuss matters related to the condominium, including board of director elections or recalls, potential or actual ballot issues or revisions to the condominium documents, property maintenance or safety issues or any other condominium matters.  A unit owner may invite one political candidate or one non-unit owner guest to speak to an assembly of unit owners about matters related to the condominium.

Therefore, the power to control rents on private residential property is preempted by the state. Cities, including charter cities, or towns shall not have the power to control rents.

B. The provisions of subsection A shall not apply to residential property which is owned, financed, insured or subsidized by any state agency, or by any city, including charter city, or town.

A sale at auction may or may not occur as a result of this foreclosure.  Currently, the sale of this property has been set for _________ (time, date and place) or no date for sale of this property has been established.

B. If the owner receives a notice of trustee's sale or other notice of foreclosure on the property after a tenant has entered into a rental agreement on the property, the owner shall provide the tenant with written notice as prescribed in subsection A of this section within five business days after receipt of the notice of trustee's sale.  This subsection applies only to the first notice of trustee's sale or the first notice of foreclosure received by the owner after the tenant has entered into the rental agreement.

C. If the owner fails to provide notice as prescribed in this section the tenant may deliver a written notice pursuant to section 33-1361 and recover damages and obtain injunctive relief.  The security deposit shall be returned to the tenant as prescribed in section 33-1321.

#### Section 33-1342. Rules and regulations

A. A landlord, from time to time, may adopt rules or regulations, however described, concerning the tenant's use and occupancy of the premises. Such rules or regulations are enforceable against the tenant only if:

1. Their purpose is to promote the convenience, safety or welfare of the tenants in the premises, preserve the landlord's property from abusive use or make a fair distribution of services and facilities held out for the tenants generally.

2. They are reasonably related to the purpose for which adopted.

The tenant shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the landlord to enter into the dwelling unit in order to inspect the premises, make necessary or agreed repairs, decorations, alterations or improvements, supply necessary or agreed services or exhibit the dwelling unit to prospective or actual purchasers, mortgagees, tenants, workmen or contractors.

B. If the tenant notifies the landlord of a service request or a request for maintenance as prescribed in section 33-1341, paragraph 8, the notice from the tenant constitutes permission from the tenant for the landlord to enter the dwelling unit pursuant to subsection D of this section for the sole purpose of acting on the service or maintenance request and the tenant waives receipt of any separate or additional access notice that may be required pursuant to subsection D of this section.

C. The landlord may enter the dwelling unit without consent of the tenant in case of emergency.

### Article 4 - Remedies

#### Section 33-1361. Noncompliance by the landlord

A. Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement, including a material falsification of the written information provided to the tenant, the tenant may deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than ten days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied in ten days. If there is a noncompliance by the landlord with section 33-1324 materially affecting health and safety, the tenant may deliver a written notice to the landlord specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than five days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied in five days. For the purposes of this section, material falsification includes false information relating to availability of the unit, except when a holdover tenant is in illegal possession or in violation of the rental agreement, the condition of the premises and any current services as represented by the landlord in writing and any representation regarding future services and any future changes regarding the condition of the premises, the provision of utility services and the designation of the party responsible for the payment of utility services. The rental agreement shall terminate and the dwelling unit shall be vacated as provided in the notice subject to the following:

1. If the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise and the landlord adequately remedies the breach prior to the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement will not terminate.

2. The tenant may not terminate for a condition caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member of the tenant's family or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent.

B. Except as provided in this chapter, the tenant may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief for any noncompliance by the landlord with the rental agreement or with section 33-1318 or 33-1324.

C. The remedy provided in subsection B of this section is in addition to any right of the tenant arising under subsection A of this section.

D. If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord shall return all security recoverable by the tenant under section 33-1321.

 

#### Section 33-1362. Failure to deliver possession

A. If the landlord fails to deliver physical possession of the dwelling unit to the tenant as provided in section 33-1323, rent abates until possession is delivered and the tenant may do either of the following:

1. Upon at least five days' written notice to the landlord terminate the rental agreement and upon termination the landlord shall return all prepaid rent and security.

2. Demand performance of the rental agreement by the landlord and, if the tenant elects, maintain an action for possession of the dwelling unit against the landlord or any person wrongfully in possession and recover the damages sustained by him.

B. If the landlord fails to deliver constructive possession to the tenant because of noncompliance with section 33-1324, rent shall not abate. Tenant may proceed with the remedies provided for in section 33-1361.

C. If a person's failure to deliver possession is willful and not in good faith, an aggrieved person may recover from that person an amount not more than two months' periodic rent or twice the actual damages sustained by him, whichever is greater.

#### Section 33-1363. Self-help for minor defects

A. If the landlord fails to comply with section 33-1324, and the reasonable cost of compliance is less than three hundred dollars, or an amount equal to one-half of the monthly rent, whichever amount is greater, the tenant may recover damages for the breach under section 33-1361, subsection B, or may notify the landlord of the tenant's intention to correct the condition at the landlord's expense. After being notified by the tenant in writing, if the landlord fails to comply within ten days or as promptly thereafter as conditions require in case of emergency, the tenant may cause the work to be done by a licensed contractor and, after submitting to the landlord an itemized statement and a waiver of lien, deduct from his rent the actual and reasonable cost of the work, not exceeding the amount specified in this subsection.

B. A tenant may not repair at the landlord's expense if the condition was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member of the tenant's family or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent or if the condition repaired does not constitute a breach of the fit and habitable condition of the premises.

 

#### Section 33-1364. Wrongful failure to supply heat, air conditioning, cooling, water, hot water or essential services

A. If contrary to the rental agreement or section 33-1324 the landlord deliberately or negligently fails to supply running water, gas or electrical service, or both if applicable, and reasonable amounts of hot water or heat, air-conditioning or cooling, where such units are installed and offered, or essential services, the tenant may give reasonable notice to the landlord specifying the breach and may do one of the following:

1. Procure reasonable amounts of hot water, running water, heat and essential services during the period of the landlord's noncompliance and deduct their actual reasonable cost from the rent. If the landlord has failed to provide any of the utility services specified in this section due to nonpayment of the landlord's utility bill for the premises, and if there is no separate utility meter for each tenant in the premises such that the tenant could avoid a utility shutoff by arranging to have services transferred to the tenant's name, the tenant may either individually or collectively with other tenants arrange with the utility company to pay the utility bill after written notice to the landlord of the tenant's intent to do so. With the utility company's approval the tenant or tenants may pay the landlord's delinquent utility bill and deduct from any rent owed to the landlord the actual cost of the payment the tenant made to restore utility services. The tenant or tenants may continue to make such payments to the utility company until the landlord has provided adequate assurances to the tenant that the above utility services will be maintained.

2. Recover damages based upon the diminution in the fair rental value of the dwelling unit.

3. Procure reasonable substitute housing during the period of the landlord's noncompliance, in which case the tenant is excused from paying rent for the period of the landlord's noncompliance. In the event the periodic cost of such substitute housing exceeds the amount of the periodic rent, upon delivery by tenant of proof of payment for such substitute housing, tenant may recover from landlord such excess costs up to an amount not to exceed twenty-five per cent of the periodic rent which has been excused pursuant to this paragraph.

B. A landlord shall provide all utilities and services specified in the lease agreement.

C. A landlord shall not terminate utility services as specified in subsection A of this section which are provided to the tenant as part of the rental agreement, except as necessary to make needed repairs or as provided in section 33-1368. Subsequent to the execution of the rental agreement, a landlord may not transfer the responsibility for payment of such utility services to the tenant without the tenant's written consent.

D. If a landlord is in violation of subsection C of this section, the tenant may recover damages, costs and reasonable attorneys fees and obtain injunctive relief. Nothing in this section shall preclude a tenant's right to recover damages as specified in section 33-1367.

E. A lease agreement shall not contain any terms contrary to this section.

F. In addition to the remedy provided in paragraph 3 of subsection A of this section, in the event the landlord's noncompliance is deliberate, the tenant may recover the actual and reasonable cost or fair and reasonable value of the substitute housing not in excess of an amount equal to the periodic rent.

G. If the tenant proceeds under this section, he may not proceed under section 33-1361 or section 33-1363 as to that breach, except as to damages which occur prior to the tenant proceeding under subsection A or B of this section.

H. The rights under this section do not arise until the tenant has given notice to the landlord and such rights do not include the right to repair. Such rights do not arise if the condition was caused by the deliberate or negligent act or omission of the tenant, a member of the tenant's family or other person on the premises with the tenant's consent.

#### Section 33-1365. Landlord's noncompliance as defense to action for possession or rent; definition

A. In an action for possession based upon nonpayment of the rent or in an action for rent where the tenant is in possession, if the landlord is not in compliance with the rental agreement or this chapter, the tenant may counterclaim for any amount which he may recover under the rental agreement or this chapter. In that event after notice and hearing the court from time to time may order the tenant to pay into court all or part of the undisputed rent accrued and all periodic rent thereafter accruing and shall determine the amount due to each party. The party to whom a net amount is owed shall be paid first from the money paid into court and the balance, if any, by the other party. However, if no rent remains due after application of this section, or if the tenant is adjudged to have acted in good faith and satisfies a judgment for rent entered for the landlord, judgment shall be entered for the tenant in the action for possession.

B. In an action for rent where the tenant is not in possession, the tenant may counterclaim as provided in subsection A but the tenant is not required to pay any rent into court.

#### Section 33-1366. Fire or casualty damage

A. If the dwelling unit or premises are damaged or destroyed by fire or casualty to an extent that enjoyment of the dwelling unit is substantially impaired, the tenant may do either of the following:

1. Immediately vacate the premises and notify the landlord in writing within fourteen days thereafter of his intention to terminate the rental agreement, in which case the rental agreement terminates as of the date of vacating.

2. If continued occupancy is lawful, vacate any part of the dwelling unit rendered unusable by the fire or casualty, in which case the tenant's liability for rent is reduced in proportion to the diminution in the fair rental value of the dwelling unit.

B. If the rental agreement is terminated the landlord shall return all security recoverable under section 33-1321. Accounting for rent in the event of termination or apportionment is to occur as of the date the tenant vacates all or part of the dwelling unit.

#### Section 33-1367. Tenant's remedies for landlord's unlawful ouster, exclusion or diminution of services

If the landlord unlawfully removes or excludes the tenant from the premises or wilfully diminishes services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of electric, gas, water or other essential service to the tenant, the tenant may recover possession or terminate the rental agreement and, in either case, recover an amount not more than two months' periodic rent or twice the actual damages sustained by him, whichever is greater. If the rental agreement is terminated the landlord shall return all security recoverable under section 33-1321.

#### Section 33-1368. Noncompliance with rental agreement by tenant; failure to pay rent; utility discontinuation; liability for guests; definition

A. Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement, including material falsification of the information provided on the rental application, the landlord may deliver a written notice to the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate on a date not less than ten days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied in ten days. For the purposes of this section, material falsification includes the following untrue or misleading information about the:

1. Number of occupants in the dwelling unit, pets, income of the prospective tenant, social security number and current employment listed on the application or lease agreement.

2. Tenant's criminal records, prior eviction record and current criminal activity. Material falsification of information in this paragraph is not curable under this section.

If there is a noncompliance by the tenant with section 33-1341 materially affecting health and safety, the landlord may deliver a written notice to the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate on a date not less than five days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied in five days. However, if the breach is remediable by repair or the payment of damages or otherwise, and the tenant adequately remedies the breach before the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement will not terminate.  If there is an additional act of these types of noncompliance of the same or a similar nature during the term of the lease after the previous remedy of noncompliance, the landlord may institute a special detainer action pursuant to section 33-1377 ten days after delivery of a written notice advising the tenant that a second noncompliance of the same or a similar nature has occurred. If there is a breach that is both material and irreparable and that occurs on the premises, which may include an illegal discharge of a weapon, homicide as prescribed in sections 13-1102, 13-1103, 13-1104 and 13-1105, prostitution as defined in section 13-3211, criminal street gang activity as prescribed in section 13-105, activity as prohibited in section 13-2308, the unlawful manufacturing, selling, transferring, possessing, using or storing of a controlled substance as defined in section 13-3451, threatening or intimidating as prohibited in section 13-1202, assault as prohibited in section 13-1203, acts that have been found to constitute a nuisance pursuant to section 12-991 or a breach of the lease agreement that otherwise jeopardizes the health, safety and welfare of the landlord, the landlord's agent or another tenant or involving imminent or actual serious property damage, the landlord may deliver a written notice for immediate termination of the rental agreement and shall proceed under section 33-1377.  The foregoing list of actions which may constitute a material and irreparable breach of a tenant's lease is not exhaustive.

B. A tenant may not withhold rent for any reason not authorized by this chapter. If rent is unpaid when due and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice by the landlord of nonpayment and the landlord's intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period of time, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement by filing a special detainer action pursuant to section 33-1377. Before the filing of a special detainer action the rental agreement shall be reinstated if the tenant tenders all past due and unpaid periodic rent and a reasonable late fee set forth in a written rental agreement. After a special detainer action is filed the rental agreement is reinstated only if the tenant pays all past due rent, reasonable late fees set forth in a written rental agreement, attorney fees and court costs. After a judgment has been entered in a special detainer action in favor of the landlord, any reinstatement of the rental agreement is solely in the discretion of the landlord.

C. The landlord may recover all reasonable damages resulting from noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or section 33-1341 or occupancy of the dwelling unit, court costs, reasonable attorney fees and all quantifiable damage caused by the tenant to the premises.

D. The landlord may discontinue utility services provided by the landlord on the day following the day that a writ of restitution or execution is executed pursuant to section 12-1181. Disconnections shall be performed only by a person authorized by the utility whose service is being discontinued. This section does not supersede standard tariff and operational procedures that apply to any public service corporation, municipal corporation or special districts providing utility services in this state.

E. On the day following the day that a writ of restitution or execution is executed pursuant to section 12-1181, the landlord shall comply with section 33-1370, subsections D, E, F, G, H and I regarding the tenant's personal property.

F. For the purposes of this chapter, the tenant shall be held responsible for the actions of the tenant's guests that violate the lease agreement or rules or regulations of the landlord if the tenant could reasonably be expected to be aware that such actions might occur and did not attempt to prevent those actions to the best of the tenant's ability.

G. For the purposes of this section, "days" means calendar days.

#### Section 33-1369. Failure to maintain

If there is noncompliance by the tenant with section 33-1341 materially affecting health and safety that can be remedied by repair, replacement of a damaged item or cleaning and the tenant fails to comply as promptly as conditions require in case of emergency or within fourteen days after written notice by the landlord specifying the breach and requesting that the tenant remedy it within that period of time, the landlord may enter the dwelling unit and cause the work to be done in a workmanlike manner and submit an itemized bill for the actual and reasonable cost or the fair and reasonable value thereof as rent on the next date when periodic rent is due, or if the rental agreement has terminated, for immediate payment.

#### Section 33-1370. Abandonment; notice; remedies; personal property; definition

A. If a dwelling unit is abandoned after the time prescribed in subsection J of this section, the landlord shall send the tenant a notice of abandonment by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the tenant's last known address and to any of the tenant's alternate addresses known to the landlord. The landlord shall also post a notice of abandonment on the door to the dwelling unit or any other conspicuous place on the property for five days.

B. Five days after the notice of abandonment has been both posted and mailed, the landlord may retake the dwelling unit and rerent the dwelling unit at a fair rental value if no personal property remains in the dwelling unit. After the landlord retakes the dwelling unit, money held by the landlord as a security deposit is forfeited and shall be applied to the payment of any accrued rent and other reasonable costs incurred by the landlord by reason of the tenant's abandonment.

C. If the tenant abandons the dwelling unit, the landlord shall make reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental. If the landlord rents the dwelling unit for a term beginning before the expiration of the rental agreement, the rental agreement is deemed to be terminated as of the date the new tenancy begins. If the landlord fails to use reasonable efforts to rent the dwelling unit at a fair rental or if the landlord accepts the abandonment as a surrender, the rental agreement is deemed to be terminated by the landlord as of the date the landlord has notice of the abandonment. If the tenancy is from month to month or week to week, the term of the rental agreement for this purpose shall be deemed to be a month or a week, as the case may be.

D. After the landlord retakes possession of the dwelling unit, and if the tenant's personal property remains in the dwelling unit, the landlord shall prepare an inventory and notify the tenant of the location and cost of storage of the personal property in the same manner prescribed in subsection A of this section.

E. After the landlord retakes possession of the dwelling unit, the landlord may store the tenant's personal possessions in the unoccupied dwelling unit that was abandoned by the tenant, any other available unit or any storage space owned by the landlord or off the premises if a dwelling unit or storage space is not available. The landlord is not required to store the tenant's perishable items, plants and animals on behalf of the tenant. The landlord may remove or dispose of, as appropriate, the perishable items, including plants. At the landlord's discretion, the landlord may remove and dispose of any personal property in the dwelling unit that is contaminated, may be considered a biohazard or poses a health and safety risk. After notifying any person who was authorized by the tenant to retrieve the tenant's animal as prescribed in section 33-1314 and no retrieval occurs after one calendar day, the tenant's abandoned animals may be immediately removed and released to a shelter or boarding facility. The landlord shall keep a record of the name and location of the shelter or boarding facility to which the animal was released. If the landlord does not immediately remove and release the abandoned animals to a shelter or boarding facility, the landlord shall provide reasonable care for the abandoned animals for the period prescribed by subsection F of this section. If the landlord is unable or unwilling to provide reasonable care to the abandoned animals, the landlord shall notify the county enforcement agent as defined in section 11-1001 or an animal control officer as prescribed in section 9-499.04 of the presence of the tenant's abandoned animals on the property to be seized pursuant to section 13-4281. The landlord is not liable for any actions taken in good faith related to the removal, release, seizure or care of the abandoned animals pursuant to this section.

F. The landlord shall hold the tenant's personal property for a period of fourteen calendar days after the landlord retakes possession of the dwelling unit. The landlord shall use reasonable care in moving and holding the tenant's personal property. If the landlord holds the property for this period and the tenant makes no reasonable effort to recover it, the landlord may donate the personal property to a qualifying charitable organization as defined in section 43-1088 or otherwise recognized charity or sell the property. If the landlord sells the property, the landlord shall retain the proceeds and apply them toward the tenant's outstanding rent or other costs that are covered in the lease agreement or otherwise provided for in this chapter or title 12, chapter 8 and that have been incurred by the landlord, and excess proceeds shall be mailed to the tenant at the tenant's last known address. A tenant does not have any right of access to that property until the actual removal and storage costs have been paid in full, except that the tenant may obtain clothing and the tools, apparatus and books of a trade or profession and any identification or financial documents, including all those related to the tenant's immigration status, employment status, public assistance or medical care. The landlord may destroy or otherwise dispose of some or all of the property if the landlord reasonably determines that the value of the property is so low that the cost of moving and storing the property and conducting a public sale exceeds the amount that would be realized from the sale. Any tax benefit associated with the donation of the personal property belongs to the tenant. A landlord that complies with this section is not liable for any loss to the tenant or any third party that results from moving, storing or donating any personal property left in the dwelling unit.

G. For a period of twelve months after the sale, the landlord shall:

1. Keep adequate records of the outstanding and unpaid rent and the sale of the tenant's personal property.

2. Hold for the benefit of the tenant any excess proceeds that have been returned as undeliverable.

H. If the tenant notifies the landlord in writing on or before the date the landlord sells or otherwise disposes of the personal property that the tenant intends to remove the personal property from the dwelling unit or the place of safekeeping, the tenant has five days to reclaim the personal property. To reclaim the personal property the tenant must only pay for the costs associated with removal and storage for the period the tenant's personal property was stored. Except as provided in subsection E or I of this section for personal property exempt from storage requirements, within five days after a written offer by the tenant to pay the applicable storage or removal costs the landlord must surrender possession of the personal property in the landlord's possession to the tenant on the tenant's tender of payment. If the landlord fails to surrender possession of the personal property to the tenant, the tenant may recover the possessions or an amount equal to the damages determined by the court if the landlord has destroyed or disposed of the possessions before the fourteen days specified in this section or after the tenant's offer to pay.

I. Notwithstanding subsections D, E, F and G of this section, if the tenant returns to the landlord the keys to the dwelling unit and there is personal property remaining in the dwelling unit, the landlord may immediately remove and dispose of the personal property without liability to the tenant or a third party unless the landlord and tenant have agreed in writing to some other treatment of the property.

J. For the purposes of this section, "abandonment" means either of the following:

1. The absence of the tenant from the dwelling unit, without notice to the landlord for at least seven days, if rent for the dwelling unit is outstanding and unpaid for ten days and there is no reasonable evidence other than the presence of the tenant's personal property that the tenant is occupying the residence.

2. The absence of the tenant for at least five days, if the rent for the dwelling unit is outstanding and unpaid for five days and none of the tenant's personal property is in the dwelling unit.

#### Section 33-1371. Acceptance of partial payments; waiver of right to terminate; exception

A. A landlord is not required to accept a partial payment of rent or other charges. A landlord accepting a partial payment of rent or other charges retains the right to proceed against a tenant only if the tenant agrees in a contemporaneous writing to the terms and conditions of the partial payment with regard to continuation of the tenancy. The written agreement shall contain a date on which the balance of the rent is due. The landlord may proceed as provided in this article and in title 12, chapter 8 against a tenant in breach of this agreement or any other breach of the original rental agreement. If the landlord has provided the tenant with a notice of failure to pay rent as specified in section 33-1368, subsection B before the completion of the agreement for partial payment, no additional notice under section 33-1368, subsection B is required in case of a breach of the partial payment agreement.

B. For the purposes of this section, a landlord's acceptance of a housing assistance payment does not constitute an acceptance of a partial payment of rent or a waiver of a landlord's right to terminate the rental agreement for any breach by the tenant.

C. Except as specified in subsections A and B of this section, acceptance of rent, or any portion of rent, with knowledge of a default by the tenant or acceptance of performance by the tenant that varied from the terms of the rental agreement or rules or regulations subsequently adopted by the landlord constitutes a waiver of the right to terminate the rental agreement for that breach.

#### Section 33-1372. Landlord liens; distraint for rent

A. A lien or security interest on behalf of the landlord in the tenant's household goods is not enforceable unless perfected before the effective date of this chapter.

B. Distraint for rent is abolished.

#### Section 33-1373. Remedy after termination

If the rental agreement is terminated, the landlord may have a claim for possession and for rent and a separate claim for actual damages for breach of the rental agreement.

#### Section 33-1374. Recovery of possession limited

A landlord may not recover or take possession of the dwelling unit by action or otherwise, including forcible removal of the tenant or his possessions, willful diminution of services to the tenant by interrupting or causing the interruption of electric, gas, water or other essential service to the tenant, except in case of abandonment, surrender or as permitted in this chapter.

#### Section 33-1375. Periodic tenancy; hold-over remedies

A. The landlord or the tenant may terminate a week-to-week tenancy by a written notice given to the other at least ten days prior to the termination date specified in the notice.

B. The landlord or the tenant may terminate a month-to-month tenancy by a written notice given to the other at least thirty days prior to the periodic rental date specified in the notice.

C. If the tenant remains in possession without the landlord's consent after expiration of the term of the rental agreement or its termination, the landlord may bring an action for possession and if the tenant's holdover is willful and not in good faith the landlord, in addition, may recover an amount equal to not more than two months' periodic rent or twice the actual damages sustained by the landlord, whichever is greater. If the landlord consents in writing to the tenant's continued occupancy, section 33-1314, subsection D applies.

#### Section 33-1376. Landlord and tenant remedies for abuse of access

A. If the tenant refuses to allow lawful access, the landlord may obtain injunctive relief to compel access, or terminate the rental agreement. In either case, the landlord may recover actual damages.

B.

In either case, the tenant may recover actual damages not less than an amount equal to one month's rent.

#### Section 33-1377. Special detainer actions; service; trial postponement

A. Special detainer actions shall be instituted for remedies prescribed in section 33-1368. Except as provided in this section, the procedure and appeal rights prescribed in title 12, chapter 8, article 4 apply to special detainer actions.

B. The summons shall be issued on the day the complaint is filed and shall command the person against whom the complaint is made to appear and answer the complaint at the time and place named which shall be not more than six nor less than three days from the date of the summons. The tenant is deemed to have received the summons three days after the summons is mailed if personal service is attempted and within one day of issuance of the summons a copy of the summons is conspicuously posted on the main entrance of the tenant's residence and on the same day the summons is sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the tenant's last known address. The summons in a special detainer action shall be served at least two days before the return day and the return day made on the day assigned for trial. Service of process in this manner shall be deemed the equivalent of having served the tenant in person for the purposes of awarding a money judgment for all rent, damages, costs and attorney fees due.

If after the hearing the court finds by preponderance of the evidence that the material and irreparable breach did occur, the court shall order restitution in favor of the plaintiff not less than twelve nor more than twenty-four hours later.

F. If the defendant is found guilty, the court shall give judgment for the plaintiff for restitution of the premises, for late charges stated in the rental agreement, for costs and, at the plaintiff's option, for all rent found to be due and unpaid through the periodic rental period provided for in the rental agreement as described in section 33-1314, subsection C and shall grant a writ of restitution.

G. If the defendant is found not guilty, judgment shall be given for the defendant against the plaintiff for costs, and if it appears that the plaintiff has acquired possession of the premises since commencement of the action, a writ of restitution shall issue in favor of the defendant.

#### Section 33-1378. Removal of guest

A person who is a guest of a tenant who is not named on a written lease and who remains on the premises without the permission of the tenant or the landlord is not a lawful tenant and that person's presence in or on the premises does not constitute residency or tenancy.  A person who knowingly remains on the premises without the permission of the tenant or the landlord may be removed by a law enforcement officer at the request of the tenant or the landlord who is entitled to possession of the premises.

 

#### Section 33-1379. Eviction action; dismissal; sealed records

A. In any action for eviction pursuant to section 33-1368 or 33-1377 or pursuant to a forcible entry and detainer action, on the court entering an order that dismisses the action for eviction prior to entry of a judgment or that enters judgment in favor of the tenant, the court shall issue an order sealing all records related to the case.

B. The court shall also order the sealing of an eviction case on the filing of a written stipulation by the landlord and the tenant to set aside the order of eviction and seal the eviction case court file.

C. If the records in an eviction case court file are sealed, the tenant's case records shall only be made available to the following:

1. The person whose records are sealed and any party or any attorney who has made an appearance in the case where records are sealed.

3. The clerk of the court or any department that is responsible for maintaining records, except that the tenant's sealed eviction case may not be sold or released as a part of a bulk or individual records transfer to a third party.

### Article 5 - Retaliatory Action

#### Section 33-1381. Retaliatory conduct prohibited

A. Except as provided in this section, a landlord may not retaliate by increasing rent or decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for possession after any of the following:

1. The tenant has complained to a governmental agency charged with responsibility for enforcement of a building or housing code of a violation applicable to the premises materially affecting health and safety.

2. The tenant has complained to the landlord of a violation under section 33-1324.

3. The tenant has organized or become a member of a tenants' union or similar organization.

4. The tenant has complained to a governmental agency charged with the responsibility for enforcement of the wage-price stabilization act.

B. If the landlord acts in violation of subsection A of this section, the tenant is entitled to the remedies provided in section 33-1367 and has a defense in action against him for possession. In an action by or against the tenant, evidence of a complaint within six months prior to the alleged act of retaliation creates a presumption that the landlord's conduct was in retaliation. The presumption does not arise if the tenant made the complaint after notice of termination of the rental agreement.  "Presumption", in this subsection, means that the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence.

C. Notwithstanding subsections A and B of this section, a landlord may bring an action for possession if either of the following occurs:

1. The violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant or other person in his household or upon the premises with his consent.

2. The tenant is in default in rent. The maintenance of the action does not release the landlord from liability under section 33-1361, subsection B.

#### Section 33-1408. Jurisdiction and service of process; recovery of attorney fees; treble damages

A. The appropriate court of this state may exercise jurisdiction over any landlord or tenant with respect to any conduct in this state governed by this chapter or with respect to any claim arising from a transaction subject to this chapter. In addition to any other method provided by rule or by statute, personal jurisdiction over a landlord may be acquired in a civil action or proceeding instituted in the appropriate court by the service of process in the manner provided by this section.

B. If a landlord is not a resident of this state or is a legal entity not authorized to do business in this state and engages in any conduct in this state governed by this chapter, or engages in a transaction subject to this chapter, the landlord shall designate an agent upon whom service of process may be made in this state. The agent shall be a resident of this state or a legal entity authorized to do business in this state. The designation shall be in writing and filed with the secretary of state. If no designation is made and filed or if process cannot be served in this state upon the designated agent, process may be served upon the secretary of state, but the plaintiff or petitioner shall forthwith mail a copy of this process and pleading by certified mail to the defendant or respondent at his last reasonably ascertained address. If there is no last reasonably ascertainable address and if the defendant or respondent has not complied with section 33-1432, subsections A and B, service upon the secretary of state shall be sufficient service of process without the mailing of copies to the defendant or respondent. Service of process shall be deemed complete and the time shall begin to run for the purposes of this section at the time of service upon the secretary of state. The defendant shall appear and answer within thirty days after completion thereof in the manner and under the same penalty as if he had been personally served with the summons. An affidavit of compliance with this section shall be filed with the clerk of the court on or before the return day of the process, if any, or within any further time the court allows. Where applicable, the affidavit shall contain a statement that the defendant or respondent has not complied with section 33-1432, subsections A and B or the affiant could not ascertain compliance by inquiry directed to the secretary of state.

C. In any contested action arising out of an agreement entered into pursuant to this chapter or for violation of any provisions of this chapter, the court may award the successful party reasonable attorney's fees. The award of reasonable attorney's fees shall be made to mitigate the burden of the expense of litigation to establish a just claim or a just defense. The award need not equal or relate to the attorney's fees actually paid or contracted and may not exceed the amount paid or agreed to be paid. Reasonable attorney's fees shall be awarded by the court upon clear and convincing evidence that the claim or defense constitutes harassment, is groundless and is not made in good faith. In making such award, the court may consider such evidence as it deems appropriate and shall receive such evidence during trial on the merits of the cause, or separately, regarding the amount of such fees as it deems in the best interest of the parties.

D. Treble damages may be awarded by the court in any contested action arising under this chapter upon clear and convincing evidence that the claim or defense constitutes harassment, is groundless and is not made in good faith. In making such award, the court may consider such evidence as it deems appropriate and shall receive this evidence during trial on the merits of the case, or separately. If the action is brought in justice court and a party intends to request treble damages, the party shall file with the justice court a pleading stating that treble damages are sought and that the justice court may lawfully award treble damages within the court's jurisdiction of civil actions. In the absence of such pleading, the justice of the peace may not award treble damages. If an opposing party files a verified pleading alleging that with treble damages the amount involved is potentially in excess of the justice court's jurisdiction of civil actions, the provisions of section 22-201, subsection G shall apply.

Any charges for removal or sewer services may not exceed the prevailing single family residential charge, fee or rate for these services levied by the political subdivision or provider.

The landlord shall not charge a fee for the persons rendering live-in health care, personal care or supportive services. The persons rendering live-in health care, personal care or supportive services have no rights of tenancy, and any agreement between the resident and the persons rendering live-in health care, personal care or supportive services does not modify any term or condition of the rental agreement between the landlord and tenant.

If a landlord deliberately uses a rental agreement containing provisions known to be prohibited, the tenant may recover actual damages sustained and the rental agreement is voidable by the tenant.

C. A landlord may charge a penalty fee of not to exceed five dollars per day from the due date of the rent for late payment of rent if the payment is not remitted by the sixth day from the due date.

If the responsible party is not licensed by the Arizona department of housing or the registrar of contractors, the landlord may require a security deposit or surety bond of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars minus the amount of any security deposit that was collected at the beginning of the tenant's tenancy.  The security deposit or surety bond shall be paid or provided before work begins on restoring the mobile home space and shall secure the cost of restoration if the responsible party fails to completely restore the mobile home space. The landlord shall provide an accounting of any security deposit as prescribed in section 33-1431, subsection C.

B. A mobile home shall not be removed from a mobile home park by any tenant, any mobile home owner or any other person or entity unless the person or entity that is removing the mobile home has received from the landlord a written clearance for removal. The landlord shall not interfere with the removal of a mobile home for any reason other than nonpayment of monies due as of the date of removal even if the term of the rental agreement has not expired. The written clearance shall contain both of the following:

1. A statement that all monies due for space rent as of the date of removal have been paid or that the landlord and that person or entity have otherwise agreed to the removal.

2. The requirements for a mobile home space restoration as prescribed by the rental agreement and by the mobile home park rules and regulations and that shall be performed by the responsible party listed in the removal notification that is required by subsection A of this section.

C. A person or entity who violates subsection B of this section shall be liable for two times the amount of any rents due.

D. The responsible party identified in the removal notification that is removing a mobile home from a mobile home space shall also remove all accessory structures unless the landlord has agreed in writing to allow those structures to remain. The responsible party identified in the removal notification that is removing the mobile home shall also remove all construction debris, trash and personal property on the rental space from the mobile home park and shall be responsible for restoring the space in accordance with the rental agreement and the mobile home park rules and regulations.

### Article 5 - Retaliatory Action

#### Section 33-1491. Retaliatory conduct prohibited; eviction

A. Except as provided in this section, a landlord shall not retaliate by increasing rent or decreasing services or by bringing or threatening to bring an action for eviction after any of the following:

1. The tenant has complained to a governmental agency charged with responsibility for enforcement of a building or housing code of a violation applicable to the premises materially affecting health and safety.

2. The tenant has complained to the landlord of a violation under this chapter.

3. The tenant has organized or become a member of a tenant's union or similar organization.

4. The tenant has filed an action against the landlord in the appropriate court or with the appropriate hearing officer.

B. If the landlord acts in violation of subsection A of this section, the tenant is entitled to the remedies provided in section 33-1475 and has a defense in action against him for eviction. In an action by or against the tenant, evidence of a complaint within six months prior to the alleged act of retaliation creates a presumption that the landlord's conduct was in retaliation. The presumption does not arise if the tenant made the complaint after notice of termination of the rental agreement. For the purpose of this subsection, "presumption" means that the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact presumed unless and until evidence is introduced which would support a finding of its nonexistence.

C. The landlord of a mobile home park shall specify the reason for the termination of any tenancy in such mobile home park. The reason relied on for the termination shall be set forth with specific facts, so that the date, place and circumstances concerning the reason for termination can be determined. Reference to or recital of the language of this chapter, or both, is not sufficient compliance with this subsection.

D. Notwithstanding subsections A and B of this section, a landlord may bring an action for eviction if either of the following occurs:

1. The violation of the applicable building or housing code was caused primarily by lack of reasonable care by the tenant or other person in his household or upon the premises with his consent.

2. The tenant is in default in rent. The maintenance of the action does not release the landlord from liability under section 33-1471, subsection B.

1. The mobile home has been installed on the real property with all wheels and axles removed in compliance with applicable state and local mobile home installation standards.

Any portion of a meeting may be closed only if that closed portion of the meeting is limited to consideration of one or more of the following:

1. Legal advice from an attorney for the board or the association.  On final resolution of any matter for which the board received legal advice or that concerned pending or contemplated litigation, the board may disclose information about that matter in an open meeting except for matters that are required to remain confidential by the terms of a settlement agreement or judgment.

2. Pending or contemplated litigation.

3. Personal, health or financial information about an individual member of the association, an individual employee of the association or an individual employee of a contractor for the association, including records of the association directly related to the personal, health or financial information about an individual member of the association, an individual employee of the association or an individual employee of a contractor for the association.

4. Matters relating to the job performance of, compensation of, health records of or specific complaints against an individual employee of the association or an individual employee of a contractor of the association who works under the direction of the association.

5. Discussion of a member's appeal of any violation cited or penalty imposed by the association except on request of the affected member that the meeting be held in an open session.

B. Notwithstanding any provision in the community documents, all meetings of the members' association and the board shall be held in this state.  A meeting of the members' association shall be held at least once each year. Special meetings of the members' association may be called by the president, by a majority of the board of directors or by members having at least twenty-five percent, or any lower percentage specified in the bylaws, of the votes in the association.  Not fewer than ten nor more than fifty days in advance of any meeting of the members the secretary shall cause notice to be hand-delivered or sent prepaid by United States mail to the mailing address for each lot, parcel or unit owner or to any other mailing address designated in writing by a member.  The notice shall state the date, time and place of the meeting. A notice of any annual, regular or special meeting of the members shall also state the purpose for which the meeting is called, including the general nature of any proposed amendment to the declaration or bylaws, changes in assessments that require approval of the members and any proposal to remove a director or an officer. The failure of any member to receive actual notice of a meeting of the members does not affect the validity of any action taken at that meeting.

C. Before entering into any closed portion of a meeting of the board of directors, or on notice of a meeting under subsection D of this section that will be closed, the board shall identify the paragraph under subsection A of this section that authorizes the board to close the meeting.

D. Notwithstanding any provision in the declaration, bylaws or other community documents, for meetings of the board of directors that are held after the termination of declarant control of the association, notice to members of meetings of the board of directors shall be given at least forty-eight hours in advance of the meeting by newsletter, conspicuous posting or any other reasonable means as determined by the board of directors. An affidavit of notice by an officer of the corporation is prima facie evidence that notice was given as prescribed by this section.  Notice to members of meetings of the board of directors is not required if emergency circumstances require action by the board before notice can be given.  Any notice of a board meeting shall state the date, time and place of the meeting. The failure of any member to receive actual notice of a meeting of the board of directors does not affect the validity of any action taken at that meeting.

E. Notwithstanding any provision in the declaration, bylaws or other community documents, for meetings of the board of directors that are held after the termination of declarant control of the association, all of the following apply:

1. The agenda shall be available to all members attending.

2. An emergency meeting of the board of directors may be called to discuss business or take action that cannot be delayed for the forty-eight hours required for notice. At any emergency meeting called by the board of directors, the board of directors may act only on emergency matters. The minutes of the emergency meeting shall state the reason necessitating the emergency meeting.  The minutes of the emergency meeting shall be read and approved at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the board of directors.

3. A quorum of the board of directors may meet by means of a telephone conference if a speakerphone is available in the meeting room that allows board members and association members to hear all parties who are speaking during the meeting.

4. Any quorum of the board of directors that meets informally to discuss association business, including workshops, shall comply with the open meeting and notice provisions of this section without regard to whether the board votes or takes any action on any matter at that informal meeting.

F. It is the policy of this state as reflected in this section that all meetings of a planned community, whether meetings of the members' association or meetings of the board of directors of the association, be conducted openly and that notices and agendas be provided for those meetings that contain the information that is reasonably necessary to inform the members of the matters to be discussed or decided and to ensure that members have the ability to speak after discussion of agenda items, but before a vote of the board of directors or members is taken. Toward this end, any person or entity that is charged with the interpretation of these provisions, including members of the board of directors and any community manager, shall take into account this declaration of policy and shall construe any provision of this section in favor of open meetings.

 

#### Section 33-1805. Association financial and other records

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, all financial and other records of the association shall be made reasonably available for examination by any member or any person designated by the member in writing as the member's representative.  The association shall not charge a member or any person designated by the member in writing for making material available for review.  The association shall have ten business days to fulfill a request for examination.  On request for purchase of copies of records by any member or any person designated by the member in writing as the member's representative, the association shall have ten business days to provide copies of the requested records.  An association may charge a fee for making copies of not more than fifteen cents per page.

For planned communities with fewer than fifty units, a member shall mail or deliver to a purchaser or a purchaser's authorized agent within ten days after receipt of a written notice of a pending sale of the unit, and for planned communities with fifty or more units, the association shall mail or deliver to a purchaser or a purchaser's authorized agent within ten days after receipt of a written notice of a pending sale that contains the name and address of the purchaser all of the following in either paper or electronic format:

The association is not obligated to provide information regarding alterations or improvements that occurred more than six years before the proposed sale. Nothing in this subdivision relieves the seller of a unit from the obligation to disclose alterations or improvements to the unit that violate the declaration, nor precludes the association from taking action against the purchaser of a unit for violations that are apparent at the time of purchase and that are not reflected in the association's records.

(f) If the statement is being furnished by the member, a statement as to whether the member has any knowledge of any alterations or improvements to the unit that violate the declaration.

By signing this statement, I acknowledge that I have read and understand the association's contract with me (the purchaser).  I also understand that as a matter of Arizona law, if I fail to pay my association assessments, the association may foreclose on my property." The statement shall also include a signature line for the purchaser and shall be returned to the association within fourteen calendar days.

7. A statement summarizing any pending lawsuits, except those relating to the collection of assessments owed by members other than the selling member, in which the association is a named party, including the amount of any money claimed.

B. A purchaser or seller who is damaged by the failure of the member or the association to disclose the information required by subsection A of this section may pursue all remedies at law or in equity against the member or the association, whichever failed to comply with subsection A of this section, including the recovery of reasonable attorney fees.

C. The association may charge the member a fee of not more than an aggregate of four hundred dollars to compensate the association for the costs incurred in the preparation and delivery of a statement or other documents furnished by the association pursuant to this section for purposes of resale disclosure, lien estoppel and any other services related to the transfer or use of the property. In addition, the association may charge a rush fee of not more than one hundred dollars if the rush services are required to be performed within seventy-two hours after the request for rush services, and may charge a statement or other documents update fee of not more than fifty dollars if thirty days or more have passed since the date of the original disclosure statement or the date the documents were delivered. The association shall make available to any interested party the amount of any fee established from time to time by the association.  If the aggregate fee for purposes of resale disclosure, lien estoppel and any other services related to the transfer or use of a property is less than four hundred dollars on January 1, 2010, the fee may increase at a rate of not more than twenty percent per year based on the immediately preceding fiscal year's amount not to exceed the four hundred dollar aggregate fee. The association may charge the same fee without regard to whether the association is furnishing the statement or other documents in paper or electronic format.

D. The fees prescribed by this section shall be collected no earlier than at the close of escrow and may only be charged once to a member for that transaction between the parties specified in the notice required pursuant to subsection A of this section.  An association shall not charge or collect a fee relating to services for resale disclosure, lien estoppel and any other services related to the transfer or use of a property except as specifically authorized in this section. An association that charges or collects a fee in violation of this section is subject to a civil penalty of not more than one thousand two hundred dollars.

2. A sale pursuant to section 32-2181.02.

3. A conveyance by recorded deed that bears an exemption listed in section 11-1134, subsection B, paragraph 3 or 7.  On recordation of the deed and for no additional charge, the member shall provide the association with the changes in ownership including the member's name, billing address and phone number. Failure to provide the information shall not prevent the member from qualifying for the exemption pursuant to this section.

G. For the purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires, "member" means the seller of the unit title and excludes any real estate salesperson or real estate broker who is licensed under title 32, chapter 20 and who is acting as a salesperson or broker, any escrow agent who is licensed under title 6, chapter 7 and who is acting as an escrow agent and also excludes a trustee of a deed of trust who is selling the property in a trustee's sale pursuant to chapter 6.1 of this title.

 

#### Section 33-1806.01. Rental property; member and agent information; fee; disclosure

A. A member may use the member's property as a rental property unless prohibited in the declaration and shall use it in accordance with the declaration's rental time period restrictions.

B. A member may designate in writing a third party to act as the member's agent with respect to all association matters relating to the rental property, except for voting in association elections and serving on the board of directors. The member shall sign the written designation and shall provide a copy of the written designation to the association. On delivery of the written designation, the association is authorized to conduct all association business relating to the member's rental property through the designated agent. Any notice given by the association to a member's designated agent on any matter relating to the member's rental property constitutes notice to the member.

C. Notwithstanding any provision in the community documents, on rental of a member's property an association shall not require a member or a member's agent to disclose any information regarding a tenant other than the name and contact information for any adults occupying the property, the time period of the lease, including the beginning and ending dates of the tenancy, and a description and the license plate numbers of the tenants' vehicles. If the planned community is an age restricted community, the member, the member's agent or the tenant shall show a government issued identification that bears a photograph and that confirms that the tenant meets the community's age restrictions or requirements.

D. On request of an association or its managing agent for the disclosures prescribed in subsection C of this section, the managing agent or, if there is no managing agent, the association may charge a fee of not more than twenty-five dollars, which shall be paid within fifteen days after the postmarked request.  The fee may be charged for each new tenancy for that property but may not be charged for a renewal of a lease. Except for the fee permitted by this subsection and fees related to the use of recreational facilities, the association or its managing agent shall not assess, levy or charge a fee or fine or otherwise impose a requirement on a member's rental property any differently than on an owner-occupied property in the association.

E. Notwithstanding any provision in the community documents, the association is prohibited from doing any of the following:

1. Requiring a member to provide the association with a copy of the tenant's rental application, credit report, lease agreement or rental contract or other personal information except as prescribed by this section. This paragraph does not prohibit the association from acquiring a credit report on a person in an attempt to collect a debt.

2. Requiring the tenant to sign a waiver or other document limiting the tenant's due process rights as a condition of the tenant's occupancy of the rental property.

3. Prohibiting or otherwise restricting a member from serving on the board of directors based on the member's not being an occupant of the property.

4. Imposing on a member or managing agent any fee, assessment, penalty or other charge in an amount greater than fifteen dollars for incomplete or late information regarding the information requested pursuant to subsection C of this section.

F. Any attempt by an association to exceed the fee, assessment, penalty or other charge authorized by subsection D or E of this section voids the fee, assessment, penalty or other charge authorized by subsection D or E of this section.  This section does not prevent an association from complying with the housing for older persons act of 1995 (P.L. 104–76; 109 Stat. 787).

G. An owner may use a crime free addendum as part of a lease agreement.  This section does not prohibit the owner's use of a crime free addendum.

H. This section does not prohibit and an association may lawfully enforce a provision in the community documents that restricts the residency of persons who are required to be registered pursuant to section 13-3821 and who are classified as level two or level three offenders.

I. An owner of rental property shall abate criminal activity as authorized in section 12-991.

 

#### Section 33-1807. Lien for assessments; priority; mechanics' and materialmen's liens; notice

A. The association has a lien on a unit for any assessment levied against that unit from the time the assessment becomes due. The association's lien for assessments, for charges for late payment of those assessments, for reasonable collection fees and for reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments may be foreclosed in the same manner as a mortgage on real estate but may be foreclosed only if the owner has been delinquent in the payment of monies secured by the lien, excluding reasonable collection fees, reasonable attorney fees and charges for late payment of and costs incurred with respect to those assessments, for a period of one year or in the amount of $1,200 or more, whichever occurs first, as determined on the date the action is filed. Fees, charges, late charges, monetary penalties and interest charged pursuant to section 33-1803, other than charges for late payment of assessments are not enforceable as assessments under this section. If an assessment is payable in installments, the full amount of the assessment is a lien from the time the first installment of the assessment becomes due. The association has a lien for fees, charges, late charges, other than charges for late payment of assessments, monetary penalties or interest charged pursuant to section 33-1803 after the entry of a judgment in a civil suit for those fees, charges, late charges, monetary penalties or interest from a court of competent jurisdiction and the recording of that judgment in the office of the county recorder as otherwise provided by law. The association's lien for monies other than for assessments, for charges for late payment of those assessments, for reasonable collection fees and for reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments may not be foreclosed and is effective only on conveyance of any interest in the real property.

B. A lien for assessments, for charges for late payment of those assessments, for reasonable collection fees and for reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments under this section is prior to all other liens, interests and encumbrances on a unit except:

1. Liens and encumbrances recorded before the recordation of the declaration.

2. A recorded first mortgage on the unit, a seller's interest in a first contract for sale pursuant to chapter 6, article 3 of this title on the unit recorded prior to the lien arising pursuant to subsection A of this section or a recorded first deed of trust on the unit.

3. Liens for real estate taxes and other governmental assessments or charges against the unit.

C. Subsection B of this section does not affect the priority of mechanics' or materialmen's liens or the priority of liens for other assessments made by the association. The lien under this section is not subject to chapter 8 of this title.

D. Unless the declaration otherwise provides, if two or more associations have liens for assessments created at any time on the same real estate those liens have equal priority.

E. Recording of the declaration constitutes record notice and perfection of the lien for assessments, for charges for late payment of assessments, for reasonable collection fees and for reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments. Further recordation of any claim of lien for assessments under this section is not required.

F. A lien for an unpaid assessment is extinguished unless proceedings to enforce the lien are instituted within six years after the full amount of the assessment becomes due.

G. This section does not prohibit:

1. Actions to recover amounts for which subsection A of this section creates a lien.

2. An association from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure.

H. A judgment or decree in any action brought under this section shall include costs and reasonable attorney fees for the prevailing party.

I. On written request, the association shall furnish to a lienholder, escrow agent, unit owner or person designated by a unit owner a statement setting forth the amount of any unpaid assessment against the unit. The association shall furnish the statement within ten days after receipt of the request, and the statement is binding on the association, the board of directors and every unit owner if the statement is requested by an escrow agency that is licensed pursuant to title 6, chapter 7. Failure to provide the statement to the escrow agent within the time provided for in this subsection extinguishes any lien for any unpaid assessment then due.

J. Notwithstanding any provision in the community documents or in any contract between the association and a management company, unless the member directs otherwise, all payments received on a member's account shall be applied first to any unpaid assessments, unpaid charges for late payment of those assessments, unpaid reasonable collection fees and unpaid attorney fees and costs incurred with respect to those assessments, in that order, with any remaining amounts applied next to other unpaid fees, charges and monetary penalties or interest and late charges on any of those amounts.

K. For a delinquent account for unpaid assessments or for charges related to unpaid assessments, the association shall provide the following written notice to the member at the member's address as provided to the association at least thirty days before authorizing an attorney, or a collection agency that is not acting as the association's managing agent, to begin collection activity on behalf of the association:

Your account is delinquent.  If you do not bring your account current or make arrangements that are approved by the association to bring your account current within thirty days after the date of this notice, your account will be turned over for further collection proceedings. Such collection proceedings could include bringing a foreclosure action against your property.

The notice shall be in boldfaced type or all capital letters and shall include the contact information for the person that the member may contact to discuss payment. The notice shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, and may be included within other correspondence sent to the member regarding the member's delinquent account.

L. Beginning January 1, 2020, except for planned communities that have fewer than fifty lots and that do not contract with a third party to perform management services on behalf of the association, the association shall provide a statement of account in lieu of a periodic payment book to the member with the same frequency that assessments are provided for in the declaration. The statement of account shall include the current account balance due and the immediately preceding ledger history.  If the association offers the statement of account by electronic means, a member may opt to receive the statement electronically.  The association may stop providing any further statements of account to a member if collection activity begins by an attorney, or a collection agency that is not acting as the association's managing agent, regarding that member's unpaid account. After collection activity begins, a member may request statements of account by written request to the attorney or collection agency. Any request by a member for a statement of account after collection activity begins by an attorney or a collection agency that is not acting as the association's managing agent must be fulfilled by the attorney or the collection agency responsible for the collection.  The statement of account provided by the attorney or collection agency responsible for the collection shall include all amounts claimed to be owing to resolve the delinquency through the date set forth in the statement, including attorney fees and costs, regardless of whether such amounts have been reduced to judgment.

M. An agent for the association may collect on behalf of the association directly from a member the assessments and other amounts owed by cash or check, by mailed or hand-delivered bank drafts, checks, cashier's checks or money orders, by credit, charge or debit card or by other electronic means.  For any form of payment other than for cash or for mailed or hand-delivered bank drafts, checks, cashier's checks or money orders, the agent may charge a convenience fee to the member that is approximately the amount charged to the agent by a third-party service provider.

A. Notwithstanding any provision in the community documents, an association shall not prohibit the outdoor front yard or backyard display of any of the following:

D. An association may regulate the size and number of political signs that may be placed on a member's property if the association's regulation is not more restrictive than any applicable city, town or county ordinance that regulates the size and number of political signs on residential property. If the city, town or county in which the property is located does not regulate the size and number of political signs on residential property, the association shall not limit the number of political signs, except that the maximum aggregate total dimensions of all political signs on a member's property shall not exceed nine square feet.

E. Notwithstanding any provision in the community documents, an association shall not prohibit using cautionary signs regarding children if the signs are used and displayed as follows:

1. The signs are displayed in residential areas only.

The size of a sign offering a property for sale, for rent or for lease shall be in conformance with the industry standard size sign, which shall not exceed eighteen by twenty-four inches, and the industry standard size sign rider, which shall not exceed six by twenty-four inches. This subsection applies only to a commercially produced sign, and an association may prohibit using signs that are not commercially produced.  With respect to real estate for sale, for rent or for lease in the planned community, an association shall not prohibit in any way other than as is specifically authorized by this section or otherwise regulate any of the following:

1. Temporary open house signs or a member's for sale sign. The association shall not require the use of particular signs indicating an open house or real property for sale and may not further regulate the use of temporary open house or for sale signs that are industry standard size and that are owned or used by the seller or the seller's agent.

2. Open house hours.  The association may not limit the hours for an open house for real estate that is for sale in the planned community, except that the association may prohibit an open house being held before 8:00 a.m. or after 6:00 p.m. and may prohibit open house signs on the common areas of the planned community.

3. An owner's or an owner's agent's for rent or for lease sign unless an association's documents prohibit or restrict leasing of a member's property.  An association shall not further regulate a for rent or for lease sign or require the use of a particular for rent or for lease sign other than the for rent or for lease sign shall not be any larger than the industry standard size sign of eighteen by twenty-four inches on or in the member's property.  If rental or leasing of a member's property is not prohibited or restricted, the association may prohibit an open house for rental or leasing being held before 8:00 a.m. or after 6:00 p.m.

H. Notwithstanding any provision in the community documents, an association shall not prohibit door-to-door political activity, including solicitations of support or opposition regarding candidates or ballot issues, and shall not prohibit circulating political petitions, including candidate nomination petitions or petitions in support of or opposition to an initiative, referendum or recall or other political issue on property normally open to visitors within the association, except that an association may do the following:

1. Restrict or prohibit the door-to-door political activity from sunset to sunrise.

2. Require the prominent display of an identification tag for each person engaged in the activity, along with the prominent identification of the candidate or ballot issue that is the subject of the support or opposition.

5. Make any other regulations regarding the content of an association-specific political sign except that the association may prohibit using profanity and discriminatory text, images or content based on race, color, religion, sex, familial status or national origin as prescribed by federal or state fair housing laws.

L. A planned community is not required to comply with subsection H of this section if the planned community restricts vehicular or pedestrian access to the planned community.  This section does not require a planned community to make its common elements other than roadways and sidewalks that are normally open to visitors available for the circulation of political petitions to anyone who is not an owner or resident of the community.

M. Notwithstanding any provision in the community documents, an association may not prohibit or unreasonably restrict a member's ability to peacefully assemble and use common areas of the planned community if done in compliance with reasonable restrictions for the use of that property adopted by the board of directors.  An individual member or group of members may assemble to discuss matters related to the planned community, including board elections or recalls, potential or actual ballot issues or revisions to the community documents, property maintenance or safety issues or any other planned community matters. A member may invite one political candidate or one non-member guest to speak to an assembly of members about matters related to the community.  The association shall not prohibit a member from posting notices regarding those assemblies of members on bulletin boards located on the common areas or within common area facilities.  An assembly of members prescribed by this subsection does not constitute an official members' meeting unless the meeting is noticed and convened as prescribed in the community documents and this chapter.

B. Except as provided in subsection F of this section, the landlord shall not terminate or refuse to renew a rental agreement without good cause.

C. The landlord's right to terminate or to refuse to renew a rental agreement pursuant to subsection B of this section does not arise until the landlord has complied with subsection D, E or F of this section.

D. Except as otherwise prohibited by law:

1. If there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement, the landlord shall deliver a written notice to the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and that the rental agreement will terminate on a date not less than thirty days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied in fourteen days.

If a tenant has been involved in three or more documented incidents of conduct of any type described in this section within a twelve month period, the landlord may deliver a written notice to the tenant specifying the conduct and the documentation and advising the tenant that on documentation of the next incident final notice will be given and the rental agreement or tenancy will be terminated thirty days after the date of the notice.

E. If rent is unpaid when due and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice by the landlord of nonpayment and the landlord's intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within that period of time, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement.  Before judgment in an action brought by the landlord under this subsection, the tenant may have the rental agreement reinstated by tendering the past due but unpaid periodic rent, reasonable attorney fees incurred by the landlord and court costs, if any.

A recreational vehicle that is subject to a judgment for forcible detainer may not be removed from its space until the tenant has received from the landlord a clearance for removal that shows that all monies due the landlord as of the date of removal have been paid or that the landlord and tenant have otherwise agreed to the removal. The landlord may agree in writing to accept other terms in satisfaction of the judgment. This subsection does not apply to any lienholder of record on the date of judgment or its successors or assigns.

8. Performing any other functions and duties that are necessary and proper to maintain the timeshare plan or timeshare property, as provided in the timeshare instrument.  The timeshare instrument may impose requirements on the managing entity beyond those set forth in this chapter.

B. Monies in any deferred maintenance or capital expenditure reserve account may not be transferred to an operating account for any purpose other than to pay for deferred maintenance or capital expenditures without the consent of owners of a majority of the timeshare interests in the timeshare property.  Except as provided in the timeshare instrument, the managing entity may transfer monies in any operating account to any deferred maintenance or capital expenditure reserve account without the vote or approval of owners of the timeshare interests.  The managing entity or board may transfer monies from one reserve account to another reserve account without the vote or approval of the owners of the timeshare interests.

C. The managing entity may invest the operating and reserve monies of the timeshare plan or timeshare property but the managing entity shall give safety of capital greater weight than production of income. The managing entity shall not invest timeshare plan or timeshare property monies with a developer or with any entity that is not independent of any developer or any managing entity, and the managing entity shall not invest timeshare plan or timeshare property monies in notes and mortgages related in any way to the timeshare plan or timeshare property.

D. The managing entity of a timeshare plan or timeshare property shall not commingle operating monies with reserve monies but the managing entity may maintain operating and reserve monies within a single account for a period not to exceed ninety days after the date on which the managing entity received payment of those monies.

E. A managing entity that serves as managing entity of more than one timeshare plan shall not commingle the common expense monies of any one timeshare plan with the common expense monies of any other timeshare plan.

F. The managing entity may levy and enforce assessments on any timeshare interests in accordance with the timeshare instrument, and the assessment constitutes a debt of the owner of the interest at the time the assessment is made.  Assessments and other monetary obligations are governed as follows:

1. The timeshare instrument shall provide for the allocation of common expenses among timeshare interests, as assessments, on a reasonable basis.  The timeshare instrument may allocate expenses differently between accommodations that are part of the timeshare plan and facilities that are not part of the timeshare plan if the different allocations are based on reasonable differences in the benefit provided to each type of property.  The timeshare instrument shall allocate common expenses to timeshare interests owned or not yet sold by a developer on the same basis that common expenses are allocated to similar or equivalent timeshare interests sold to purchasers, as assessments, except if a subsidy agreement or similar document is in place that provides for the developer to pay no, or a lesser share of, common expenses in return for subsidizing any deficits or shortfalls in the operating monies of the timeshare plan, and if that exclusion from or reduced assessments and subsidy agreement or other document are referred to in the public reports issued under section 32-2197.08.

2. The managing entity may impose reasonable monetary penalties for violation of the timeshare instrument, as an assessment, as authorized by the timeshare instrument.

3. Assessments may include personal charges and other amounts as authorized by the timeshare instrument.

4. The managing entity may assign to the delinquent owners the costs of collection, including attorney fees, administrative fees, late fees, interest and penalties as authorized by the timeshare instrument.

5. The amount of any assessment plus any other charges such as interest, collection costs, attorney fees, administrative fees, late fees, interest and penalties, as may be provided for in the timeshare instrument, are a lien on the timeshare interest assessed from the time the assessment became due.  The lien has priority over other liens as provided in the timeshare instrument.  The lien may be enforced, foreclosed or realized on as provided in the timeshare instrument.

6. On the receipt of a written request, the managing entity shall furnish to an owner or any lender who has a security interest in a timeshare interest or the timeshare property a statement setting forth the amount of unpaid assessments made against the owner’s timeshare interest.  The statement must be furnished within ten business days after receipt of the request and is binding on the managing entity, the association, the board and every owner.

 

 

#### Section 33-2207. Foreclosure of assessment liens

A. If an association, developer or other managing entity files an action to foreclose the assessment lien on timeshare interests, the association, developer or other managing entity may join in the same action multiple defendant obligors and junior interest holders of separate timeshare interests, on compliance with all of the following:

1. The foreclosure proceeding involves a single timeshare plan.

2. The foreclosure proceeding is filed by a single plaintiff.

Unless otherwise provided in the timeshare instrument, not fewer than thirty nor more than ninety days in advance of any regular meeting of the owners, and not fewer than ten nor more than sixty days in advance of any special meeting of the owners, the association or managing entity shall cause notice of the meeting to be sent or provided to the mailing address of each owner on record with the association.  The notice of any meeting of the owners shall state the time and place of the meeting.  The notice of any special meeting of the owners shall also state the purpose for which the meeting is called.  Notices of meetings may be in the form of an annual or other list of upcoming meetings and need not be specific to one meeting.  The failure of any owner to receive actual notice of a meeting of the owners does not affect the validity of any action taken at that meeting.

C. Unless otherwise provided in the timeshare instrument, for meetings of the board of directors that are held after the termination of developer control of the association, at least ten days in advance of any meeting of the board, the association or managing entity shall cause notice of the meeting to be sent to the mailing address of each owner on record with the association.  Notice to owners of meetings of the board is not required if emergency circumstances require action by the board before notice can be given.  Any notice of a board meeting shall state the time and place of the meeting.  Notices of meetings may be in the form of an annual or other list of upcoming meetings and need not be specific to one meeting.  The failure of any owner to receive actual notice of a meeting of the board does not affect the validity of any action taken at that meeting.

D. Notices may be in newsletters or similar mailings.  Mailing shall occur by prepaid United States mail or electronic mail for those owners who have provided electronic mail addresses or any other reasonable method selected by the board.  An affidavit of notice by an officer of the association or by the managing entity is prima facie evidence that notice was given as prescribed by this section.

D. This section does not affect either:

1. Inspection of records under section 10-3720, if applicable, or, if the owner is in litigation with the association or other managing entity, inspection of records to the same extent as any other litigant.

2. The power of a court, independently of this chapter, to compel the production of records for examination on proof by an owner of proper purpose.

E. A request to copy records under this section includes, if reasonable, receiving copies made by photographic, xerographic or other means.  The association or other managing entity may impose a reasonable charge covering the cost of labor and materials for copies of any documents provided to the owner or the owner’s representative.  The charge shall not exceed the estimated cost of production or reproduction of the records.

Neither the association nor other managing entity may publish this owners’ list or provide a copy of it to any owner or to any third party.

B. The association or other managing entity shall mail to those persons listed on the owners’ list prescribed by subsection A any materials provided by any owner, on the written request of that owner, if the purpose of the mailing is to advance legitimate association business, such as a proxy solicitation for any purpose, including the recall of one or more board members elected by the owners or the discharge of the manager or management firm.  The use of any proxies solicited in this manner must comply with the timeshare instrument and this chapter.  A mailing requested for the purpose of advancing legitimate association business shall occur within thirty days after receipt of a request from an owner.  The board of the association or the managing entity is responsible for determining the appropriateness of any mailing requested pursuant to this subsection and for establishing reasonable procedures for the exercise of the rights provided in this section.  The association or other managing entity does not have an obligation to mail items that the association or other managing entity reasonably believes may be libelous or otherwise actionable or on advice of legal counsel.  The owner who requests the mailing shall reimburse the association or other managing entity in advance for the actual costs in performing the mailing or a proportionate share of actual costs if the mailing is included in a mailing that includes other items.

C. If the requesting owner has complied with the reasonable procedures established by the board or managing entity for mailing requests, it is a violation of this chapter for the association or other managing entity to refuse to mail any material requested by the owner to be mailed, if the sole purpose of the materials is to advance legitimate association business and the requesting owner has either tendered to the association or managing entity payment of the cost pursuant to subsection B or has requested an invoice for that cost and has not received an invoice within ten days after delivering that request to the association or managing entity. If the purpose of the mailing is a proxy solicitation to recall one or more board members elected by the owners or to discharge the manager or management firm and the association or other managing entity does not mail the materials within thirty days after receipt of a request from an owner, the superior court in the county in which the timeshare plan or property is located, on application from the requesting owner, may summarily order the mailing of the materials solely related to the recall of one or more board members elected by the owners or the discharge of the manager or managing firm.  The court shall dispose of an application on an expedited basis.  In the event of such an order, the court may order the association or other managing entity to pay the owner’s costs, including attorney fees reasonably incurred to enforce the owner’s rights, unless the managing entity can demonstrate it refused the mailing in good faith because of a reasonable basis for doubt about the legitimacy of the mailing.

D. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the association or other managing entity may not furnish the name, address, telephone number or electronic mail address of any owner to any other owner or authorized agent of an owner unless the owner whose name, address, phone number or electronic mail address is requested first approves the disclosure in writing.

A. The association or other managing entity may cause a trustee's sale of the timeshare estate, of an owner who is delinquent in the payment of assessments for that timeshare estate to that association or managing entity, under a timeshare instrument pursuant to this section, but only if that owner has been delinquent in the payment of assessments for that timeshare estate for a period of one year.

B. An association or other managing entity that desires to use a trustee's sale shall prepare, execute and acknowledge a notice of delinquency identifying the owner of the timeshare estate, the nature and amount of the owner's current delinquency in payment of assessments, the legal description of the owner's timeshare estate, the name and address of the association or other managing entity and the name and address of the trustee designated by the association or managing entity to conduct the trustee's sale.

C. A notice of delinquency may apply to multiple timeshare estates owned by an owner if the owner is delinquent in payment of assessments for all of the timeshare estates included in the notice of delinquency and the notice of delinquency states separately the delinquent assessments for each timeshare estate.  A notice of delinquency may apply to multiple delinquent owners if each owner's delinquency or delinquencies are listed separately and the notice includes the information required by subsection B of this section for each owner.

D. The association or managing entity shall record the notice of delinquency with the county recorder of the county in which the timeshare property relating to the timeshare estate or estates is located and shall mail by certified mail, return receipt requested, a copy of the notice of delinquency to the owner or owners listed in the notice at the last address for each delinquent owner according to the records of the association or managing entity.  The association or other managing entity shall post a summary of the notice of delinquency on an owners' bulletin board or other owner notice board provided by the association or other managing entity at the timeshare property, subject to other applicable law.

E. A trustee appointed in a notice of delinquency and any properly appointed substitute trustee may conduct a trustee's sale of a timeshare estate under this section.  The recording of a notice of delinquency shall satisfy all requirements for the trustee, or any properly appointed substitute trustee, to appear in the chain of title for the timeshare estate in order for the trustee to be entitled to issue a trustee's deed on completion of a trustee's sale for the timeshare estate.

F. If the delinquencies identified in a notice of delinquency are not cured within thirty days after the association or managing entity mails the notice of delinquency to the delinquent owner under subsection D of this section, the association or managing entity may cause the trustee to conduct a trustee's sale of the delinquent owner's timeshare estate pursuant to sections 33-803.01, 33-804, 33-807, 33-808, 33-809, 33-810, 33-811, 33-812, 33-813 and 33-820, except as otherwise provided in this section.  For the purposes of a trustee's sale of a delinquent owner's timeshare estate pursuant to chapter 6.1 of this title:

H. The trustee's sale may include multiple timeshare estates owned by an owner if the owner is delinquent in payment of assessments for all of the timeshare estates included in the trustee's sale proceeding.  The trustee's sale may include timeshare estates owned by multiple owners if the notice of trustee's sale provides all information required by section 33-808, subsection D for each owner and timeshare estate and each timeshare estate is sold separately.

I. If fee title to a timeshare estate was acquired by an owner before January 1, 2009, the trustee shall proceed as follows and the owner may prevent a trustee's sale as to that timeshare estate as follows:

1. The notice of delinquency for any timeshare estate acquired by the owner before January 1, 2009 shall include a statement informing the owner of the owner's right to prevent a trustee's sale as to that timeshare estate by returning the form that is described in paragraph 2 of this subsection and that is signed by the owner, by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the trustee and to the association or other managing entity at the addresses stated in the notice of delinquency within thirty days after the association or other managing entity sends the notice of delinquency to the owner.

J. The remedy provided by this section does not exclude the use of any other available remedy of the association or managing entity for delinquency by a timeshare estate owner, unless an owner's timeshare estate is sold pursuant to a trustee's power of sale, in which case an action may not be maintained to recover any difference between the amount obtained by sale and the amount of the indebtedness and any interest, costs and expenses in connection with that timeshare estate.  This section does not prohibit an association or other managing entity from taking a deed in lieu of foreclosure executed by an owner of a timeshare estate.

K. This section shall not apply to any timeshare property for which the timeshare instrument expressly mandates that judicial foreclosure is the sole method for the association or other managing entity to foreclose or realize upon a lien securing payment of assessments due to that association or other managing entity.

L. For the purposes of this section:

1. Treat the rejection as a termination of the contract, and in that case the purchaser has a lien on the property for the recovery of any part of the purchase price the purchaser paid.

2. Retain the purchaser's right to possession under the contract, and in that case the purchaser shall continue to perform all obligations arising under the contract and may offset any damages caused by nonperformance of an obligation of the owner after the date of the rejection, but the purchaser has no right or claim against other receivership property or the receiver on account of the damages.

D. The court may discharge a receiver and terminate the court's administration of the receivership property if the court finds that appointment of the receiver was improvident or that the circumstances no longer warrant continuation of the receivership.  If the court finds that the appointment was sought wrongfully or in bad faith, the court may assess against the person that sought the appointment:
