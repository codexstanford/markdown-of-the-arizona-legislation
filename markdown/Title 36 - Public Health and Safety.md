A health care institution may require clergy to comply with reasonable health and safety precautions, including undergoing health screenings and wearing personal protective equipment, that are imposed by the health care institution in connection with in-person visitation for preventing the spread of communicable diseases. If such a requirement would substantially burden the clergy member's free exercise of religion while carrying out the religious purpose for which the clergy member is visiting while with the resident in the resident's room or visiting area designated by the health care institution, the health care institution may require compliance with such precautions only if compliance in that instance furthers a compelling interest and the health care institution imposes the least restrictive burden on the clergy member's exercise of religion.

D. A health care institution and its employees and contractors are not liable to a person visiting a resident or to a resident of the health care institution for civil damages for injury or death due to actual or alleged exposure to a communicable disease resulting from or related to a visitation in compliance with this section unless it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the health care institution failed to substantially comply with the health care institution's applicable health and safety precautions.  The immunity prescribed in this subsection does not apply to any act or omission unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the act or omission constitutes gross negligence or wilful or wanton misconduct.

A hospital's policies regarding visitation shall ensure that the patient and the patient's visitors may have physical contact, especially during end-of-life visitation, unless a physician determines based on the patient's condition that the visitation does not meet health and safety standards or is reasonably likely to harm the patient.  If a physician denies visitation with a patient pursuant to this section, the patient or the patient's representative, which may include the patient's spouse, parent or child, may request a meeting, as provided by the visitation policy, with the physician and the hospital's chief medical officer, chief of staff or chief executive officer to receive a review and explanation within twenty-four hours of the physician's decision to deny visitation.  If the designated visitor's request to visit is denied or not resolved at the meeting, the visitor may file a complaint with the department. All visitors must comply with reasonable health and safety precautions imposed by the hospital in connection with the visit.

#### Section 36-419. Do-not-resuscitate orders; minors; parental communication; definitions

A. For an unemancipated minor who is not under juvenile court jurisdiction pursuant to section 8-202, a provider may not implement a do-not-resuscitate order without communicating with at least one of the minor's parents or the minor's legal guardian.  The communication must include a discussion of both of the following:

1. The minor's care plan, including implementing a do-not-resuscitate order and what the do-not-resuscitate order means for the minor.

2. The rights provided under subsections E and G of this section.

B. The communication with the minor's parents or legal guardian pursuant to subsection A of this section shall be made with a witness present, other than the parents or legal guardian, who is willing to confirm that this communication took place. The provider shall immediately document and record the communication in the minor's medical record indicating whom the communication was with, who witnessed the communication and the date and time of the communication.  The provider shall ask the minor's parents or legal guardian to sign a written acknowledgement of this communication.

C. The requirements of subsections A and B of this section do not apply if the provider makes a reasonably diligent and documented effort to contact the minor's parents or legal guardian without success for at least forty-eight hours.  If a do-not-resuscitate order is entered for the minor, the reason for that order shall be documented in the minor's medical record.

D. This section does not require a provider to initially provide or continue resuscitative measures on a minor if the resuscitative measures would be medically inappropriate because providing the treatment would, in the provider's reasonable medical judgment, either:

1. Create a greater risk of causing or hastening the minor's death.

2. Be potentially harmful or cause unnecessary pain, suffering or injury to the minor because there is no further benefit to the minor in performing resuscitative measures.

E. At any point during the process described in subsections A and B of this section, a parent or legal guardian has the right to request that the minor be transferred to another facility.  If the parent or legal guardian requests a transfer, the provider shall provide reasonable time for the parent or legal guardian to find another provider that will accept the minor before implementing a do-not-resuscitate order.  The provider shall provide the minor's medical records to any accredited facility that requires the medical records to determine whether the facility is willing to care for the minor.  If an accredited facility is willing to accept the minor, the provider shall make reasonable efforts to facilitate the transfer.

F. A parent or guardian may petition a superior court in the county in which the minor resides or in which the minor is receiving treatment for an order enjoining a violation or threatened violation of this section or to resolve a conflict between the parents.  On receiving a petition, the superior court shall issue an order fixing the date, time and place of a hearing on the petition and order that notice of the hearing be given to the interested parties.  A preliminary hearing may be held without notice if the court determines that holding that hearing without notice is necessary to prevent imminent danger to the minor's life.  In the court's discretion, a hearing may be conducted in a courtroom, in a health care facility or at some other suitable place.  A do-not-resuscitate order may not be implemented pending the final determination of the proceedings, including any appeals.

G. On request of a patient or resident or a prospective patient or resident, a provider shall disclose in writing any policies relating to a patient or resident or the services a patient or resident may receive involving resuscitation or life-sustaining measures, including any policies related to treatments deemed nonbeneficial, ineffective, futile or inappropriate. This subsection does not require a provider to have a written policy relating to or involving resuscitation, life-sustaining measures or nonbeneficial treatment for unemancipated minor patients or adult patients or residents.

Important Notice About Direct Payment

For Your Health Care Services

The Arizona Constitution allows you to pay a health care facility directly for health care services.  Before you make any agreement to do so, please read the following important information:

If you are an enrollee of a health care system (more commonly referred to as a health insurance plan) and your health care facility is contracted with the health insurance plan, the following apply:

1. You may not be required to pay the health care facility directly for the services covered by your plan, except for cost share amounts that you are obligated to pay under your plan, such as copayments, coinsurance and deductible amounts.

2. Your provider's agreement with the health insurance plan may prevent the health care facility from billing you for the difference between the facility's billed charges and the amount allowed by your health insurance plan for covered services.

3. If you pay directly for a health care service, your health care facility will not be responsible for submitting claim documentation to your health insurance plan for that claim. Before paying your claim, your health insurance plan may require you to provide information and submit documentation necessary to determine whether the services are covered under your plan.

4. If you do not pay directly for a health care service, your health care facility may be responsible for submitting claim documentation to your health insurance plan for the health care service.

Your signature below acknowledges that you received this notice before paying directly for a health care service.

J. A health care facility that receives direct payment for a lawful health care service and that complies with subsection I of this section is not responsible for submitting documentation of any kind for purposes of reimbursement to any health care system for that claim if the failure to submit such documentation does not conflict with the terms of any federal or state contracts to which the health care system is a party and the health care facility has agreed to serve patients under or with applicable state or federal programs in which a health care facility and health care system participate.

K. A health care facility that receives direct payment pursuant to this section shall provide the person making the direct payment with a receipt that includes the following information:

1. The amount of the direct payment.

2. The applicable procedure and diagnosis codes for the services rendered.

L. If an enrollee pays to a health care facility that is an out-of-network provider the direct pay price for a lawful health care service that is covered under the enrollee's health care plan, pursuant to the requirements of this section, the amount paid by the enrollee shall be applied first to the enrollee's in-network deductible with any remaining monies being applied to the enrollee's out-of-network deductible, if applicable. The amount applied to the in-network deductible shall be the amount paid directly or the insurer's prevailing contracted commercial rate for the enrollee's health care plan in this state for the service or services. If the service or services do not match standard codes or bundled payment programs in use in this state by the insurer, the amount applied to the in-network deductible shall be the amount paid directly. For the purposes of this subsection, "prevailing contracted commercial rate" means the most usual and customary rate that an insurer offers as payment for a specific service under a specific health care plan, not including a plan offered under medicare or medicaid or on a health insurance exchange.

M. If an enrollee is enrolled in a high deductible plan that qualifies the enrollee for a health savings account as defined in 26 United States Code section 223, the health care system is not liable if the enrollee submits a claim for deductible application of a direct pay amount pursuant to subsection L of this section that jeopardizes the enrollee's status as an individual eligible for favorable tax treatment of the health savings account.

N. This section does not create any private right or cause of action for or on behalf of any person against the health insurer. This section provides solely an administrative remedy for any violation of this section or any related rule.

O. This section does not impair the provisions of a health care system's private health care network provider contract, except that a health care facility may accept direct payment from a person or employer or may decline to bill the health care system directly for services paid directly by a person or employer if the health care facility has complied with subsection I of this section and the health care facility's receipt of direct payment and the declination to bill the health care system do not conflict with the terms of any federal or state contract to which the health care system is a party and the health care facility has agreed to serve patients under or with applicable state or federal programs in which a health care facility and health care system participate.

P. This section may not prevent the department of health services from performing an investigation of a health care facility under the department's powers and duties as prescribed in this title. If a health care facility fails to comply with this section, the penalty shall not include the revocation of the license to deliver health care services.

Q. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Direct pay price" means the entire price that will be charged by a health care facility for a lawful health care service, regardless of the health insurance status of the person, if the entire fee for the service is paid in full directly to a health care facility by the person, including the person's health savings account, or by the person's employer and that does not prohibit a facility from establishing a payment plan with the person paying directly for services.

2. "Enrollee" means a person who is enrolled in a health care plan provided by a health insurer.

3. "Health care facility" means a hospital, outpatient surgical center, health care laboratory, diagnostic imaging center or urgent care center.

The only legal action which may be maintained by a licensed health care provider based on the performance or nonperformance of such duties and functions is an action for injunctive relief seeking to correct an erroneous decision or procedure. The review shall be limited to a review of the record. If the record shows that the denial, revocation, limitation or suspension of membership or privileges is supported by substantial evidence, no injunction shall issue. In such actions, the prevailing party shall be awarded taxable costs, but no other monetary relief shall be awarded.

C. Nothing in this section relieves any individual, hospital or outpatient surgical center from liability arising from treatment of a patient.

#### Section 36-445.03. Limitation of publication; identity of patient confidential

A. On receiving the application for evaluation, the screening agency, before filing a petition for court-ordered evaluation, shall provide prepetition screening within forty-eight hours excluding weekends and holidays when possible to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe the allegations of the applicant for the court-ordered evaluation, whether the person will voluntarily receive evaluation at a scheduled time and place and whether the person has a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability or is likely to present a danger to self or others until the voluntary evaluation.

B. After prepetition screening has been completed, the screening agency shall prepare a report of opinions and conclusions. If prepetition screening is not possible, the screening agency shall prepare a report giving reasons why the screening was not possible and including opinions and conclusions of staff members who attempted to conduct prepetition screening or otherwise investigated the matter.

If the agency determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the person is in such a condition that without immediate hospitalization he is likely to harm himself or others, the agency shall take all reasonable steps to procure such hospitalization on an emergency basis.

E. The agency may contact the county attorney in order to obtain assistance in preparing the petition for court-ordered evaluation, and the agency may request the advice and judgment of the county attorney in reaching a decision as to whether the court-ordered evaluation is justified.

F. The county attorney may prepare or sign or file the petition if a court has ordered the county attorney to prepare the petition.

G. If a petition for court-ordered evaluation alleges danger to others as described in section 36-501, the screening agency, before filing such a petition, shall contact the county attorney for a review of the petition.  The county attorney shall examine the petition and make one of the following written recommendations:

1. That a criminal investigation is warranted.

2. That the screening agency shall file the petition.

A. A person who has a substance use disorder without any co-occurring mental disorder may not be considered for involuntary treatment pursuant to article 5 of this chapter.  A person who initially presents with impairments consistent with both a mental disorder and a substance use disorder is eligible for screening and evaluation pursuant to this article, and that person may be eligible for involuntary treatment pursuant to article 5 of this chapter if, after considering the person's history, an appropriate assessment of the person's current presentation, and a reasonable period of time to rule out substance abuse as the primary cause of the alleged behavior, the person's presentation is consistent with a mental disorder that would benefit from treatment.

B. A person who has an intellectual disability may not be considered for involuntary treatment pursuant to article 5 of this chapter unless, in addition to the intellectual disability, the person has a mental disorder that would benefit from treatment.

C. A person who presents with declining mental abilities that directly accompany impending death may not be considered for involuntary treatment pursuant to article 5 of this chapter.

D. A person with a character or personality disorder characterized by lifelong and deeply ingrained antisocial behavior patterns, including sexual behaviors that are abnormal and prohibited by statute, may not be considered for involuntary treatment pursuant to article 5 of this chapter unless the person also has a mental disorder that would benefit from treatment.

E. This section does not affect any time frames otherwise prescribed in this chapter.

#### Section 36-522. Voluntary evaluation

A. If the petition for court-ordered evaluation is not filed because it has been determined that the proposed patient will voluntarily receive an evaluation and is unlikely to present a danger to self or others until the voluntary evaluation, the evaluation agency provided for by the county, or selected by the proposed patient, shall be immediately notified and shall provide evaluation of the proposed patient at a scheduled time and place within five days of the notice. The voluntary evaluation may be on an inpatient or outpatient basis.

B. Voluntary inpatient evaluation is subject to article 3 of this chapter.

C. Voluntary outpatient evaluation shall conform to the requirements of section 36-530, subsection D and section 36-531, subsections B, C and D and shall proceed only after the person to be evaluated has given consent to be evaluated by signing a form prescribed by the director that includes information to the proposed patient that the patient-physician privilege does not apply and that the evaluation may result in a petition for the person to undergo court-ordered treatment or for guardianship. Voluntary evaluation may be carried out only if chosen by the patient during the course of a prepetition screening after an application for evaluation has been made.

8. Other information that the director by rule or the court by rule or order may require.

B. The petition shall request that the court issue an order requiring that the proposed patient be given an evaluation and shall advise the court of both of the following:

1. That the opinion of the petitioner is either that the proposed patient is or is not in such a condition that without immediate or continuing hospitalization the patient is likely to suffer serious physical harm or further deterioration or inflict serious physical harm on another person.

2. If the opinion of the petitioner is that the proposed patient is not in the condition described in paragraph 1 of this subsection, that the opinion of the petitioner is either that the evaluation should or should not take place on an outpatient basis.

The peace officer, on the request of the admitting officer of the evaluation agency pursuant to this subsection, shall apprehend and transport the person to the evaluation agency. The admitting officer shall not be held civilly liable for any acts committed by a person whom the admitting officer did not advise to be taken into custody if the admitting officer has in good faith followed the requirements of this section.

A. If the procedures set forth in section 36-524 are not available, a peace officer may take into custody any individual the peace officer has probable cause to believe is, as a result of mental disorder, a danger to self or others, and if during the time necessary to complete the prepetition screening procedures set forth in sections 36-520 and 36-521 the person is likely without immediate hospitalization to suffer serious physical harm or serious illness or to inflict serious physical harm on another person. The peace officer shall transport the person to a screening agency unless the person's condition or the agency's location or hours makes such transportation impractical, in which event the person shall be transported to an evaluation agency.

If a person is hospitalized pursuant to this section, the admitting officer may notify a screening agency and seek its assistance or guidance in developing alternatives to involuntary confinement and in counseling the person and the person's family.

B. On the same or a succeeding court day, the medical director in charge of the agency shall file a petition for a court-ordered evaluation, unless the person has been discharged or has become a voluntary patient.  The petition need not comply with the provisions of this chapter requiring preparation and filing of a prepetition screening report but shall meet all other requirements and shall seek an appropriate order pursuant to section 36-529.

#### Section 36-527. Discharge and release; relief from civil liability

A. A person taken into custody for emergency admission may not be detained longer than twenty-four hours excluding weekends and holidays following such detention unless a petition for court-ordered evaluation is filed.

B. A person admitted for emergency evaluation may be released at any time if, in the opinion of the medical director in charge of the evaluation agency, release is appropriate.

D. The person detained shall be informed of his rights as stated in this section and in article 2 of this chapter, including the right to consult an attorney. He shall be advised that if he cannot employ an attorney, the court will appoint one for him. The person shall be advised that if a petition for evaluation is filed, the court will appoint the person an attorney to consult with and, if he cannot employ his own counsel, to represent him.

#### Section 36-529. Order for evaluation; order for detention; hearing; personal service of court orders

A. If, from the review of the petition for evaluation, the court does not determine that the proposed patient is likely to present a danger to self or others or further deteriorate before the proposed patient's hearing on court-ordered treatment, but determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the proposed patient is, as a result of a mental disorder, a danger to self or others or has a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability, the court shall issue an order directing the proposed patient to submit to an evaluation at a designated time and place, specifying that the evaluation will take place on an inpatient or an outpatient basis. The court may also order that, if the person does not or cannot so submit, the person be taken into custody by a peace officer and delivered to an evaluation agency. If the court makes such a conditional order, it shall also make a conditional appointment of counsel for the person to become effective when and if the person is taken into custody pursuant to this section.

B. If, from review of the petition for evaluation, there is reasonable cause to believe that the proposed patient is, as a result of a mental disorder, a danger to self or others or has a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability and that the person requires immediate or continued hospitalization before the proposed patient's hearing on court-ordered treatment, the court shall order the proposed patient taken into custody and evaluated at an evaluation agency. The court shall promptly appoint counsel for the proposed patient. If an intercounty agreement authorizes the same, the court may order that the evaluation be conducted in another county, and the superior court in the county where the evaluation is conducted has concurrent jurisdiction to make appropriate orders concerning the proposed patient.

C. If the person is not taken into custody or if the evaluation pursuant to the order of the court under subsection A or B of this section is not initiated within fourteen days after the date of the order, the order and petition for evaluation expire.  If a prosecutor filed a petition pursuant to section 13-4517, the court and the prosecuting agency shall receive notice of the expiration of the order for evaluation. The court may enter any orders necessary for further disposition pursuant to section 13-4517, including a pickup order directing that the person be taken into custody.

#### Section 36-534. Change to voluntary status; discharge; notice; hearing

A. If, after a petition for court-ordered treatment has been filed and prior to the hearing, the medical director of the evaluation agency finds that it is more appropriate to discharge the patient or to admit the proposed patient on a voluntary basis, the medical director, after receiving approval from the court, shall either discharge the patient or admit the patient for further treatment on a voluntary basis.

B. If the court approves admitting a patient for whom a petition has been filed by a prosecutor pursuant to section 13-4517 to voluntary treatment or before a patient is discharged pursuant to this section, the medical director shall provide notice to the prosecuting agency at least twenty-four hours before releasing or discharging the patient. The evaluation agency shall detain the person for an additional twenty-four hours to allow for notification to the prosecuting agency.

A. If, on the filing of a petition for court-ordered treatment, the patient is not then detained in an agency, the court shall order the detention of the patient in the agency that conducted the evaluation if the court determines that the patient is likely to present a danger to self or others before the conclusion of the hearing or is not likely to appear at the hearing on the petition if not detained.

D. The department, acting on behalf of the state hospital, the administration or a regional behavioral health authority, may intervene as a party to the proceedings on any petition for court-ordered treatment and may appear as a party at the hearing on the petition by filing a written notice of intervention with the clerk of the superior court in the county in which the petition was filed, at any time before either the original time set for the hearing or the time to which the hearing is continued.

1. Within twenty-four hours of appointment, conduct an interview of the patient. The attorney shall explain to the patient the patient's rights pending court-ordered treatment, the procedures leading to court-ordered treatment, the standards for court-ordered treatment, the alternative of becoming a voluntary patient and whether stipulations at the hearing are appropriate. If the attorney is appointed, the attorney also shall explain that the patient can obtain the patient's own counsel at the patient's own expense and that, if it is later determined that the person is not indigent, the person will be responsible for the fees of the appointed attorney for services rendered after the initial attorney-client conference.

At all hearings conducted pursuant to sections 36-539, 36-543 and 36-546, a person has the right to have an analysis of the person's mental condition by an independent evaluator.  If the person is unable to afford an evaluation, the court shall appoint an independent evaluator acceptable to the patient from a list of physicians, psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioners with sufficient relevant experience as determined by the medical director and psychologists who are willing to accept court-appointed evaluations.

 

#### Section 36-539. Conduct of hearing; record; transcript

A. The medical director of the evaluation agency shall issue instructions to the physicians or the psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner of the evaluation agency who is treating the proposed patient to take all reasonable precautions to ensure that at the time of the hearing the proposed patient shall not be so under the influence of or so suffer the effects of drugs, medication or other treatment as to be hampered in preparing for or participating in the hearing. If the proposed patient is being treated as an inpatient by the evaluation agency, the court at the time of the hearing shall be presented a record of all drugs, medication or other treatment that the person has received during the seventy-two hours immediately before the hearing.

B. The patient and the patient's attorney shall be present at all hearings, and the patient's attorney may subpoena and cross-examine witnesses and present evidence. The patient may choose to not attend the hearing or the patient's attorney may waive the patient's presence. The evidence presented by the petitioner or the patient shall include the testimony of two or more witnesses acquainted with the patient at the time of the alleged mental disorder, which may be satisfied by a statement agreed on by the parties, and testimony of the two physicians who participated in the evaluation of the patient, which may be satisfied by stipulating to the admission of the evaluating physicians' affidavits as required pursuant to section 36-533, subsection B. The physicians shall testify as to their personal observations of the patient. They shall also testify as to their opinions concerning whether the patient is, as a result of mental disorder, a danger to self or to others or has a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability and as to whether the patient requires treatment. Such testimony shall state specifically the nature and extent of the danger to self or to others, the persistent or acute disability or the grave disability. If the patient has a grave disability, the physicians shall testify concerning the need for guardianship or conservatorship, or both, and whether or not the need is for immediate appointment. Other persons who have participated in the evaluation of the patient or, if further treatment was requested by a mental health treatment agency, persons of that agency who are directly involved in the care of the patient shall testify at the request of the court or of the patient's attorney. Witnesses shall testify as to placement alternatives appropriate and available for the care and treatment of the patient. The clinical record of the patient for the current admission shall be available and may be presented in full or in part as evidence at the request of the court, the county attorney or the patient's attorney.

C. If the patient, for medical or psychiatric reasons, is unable to be present at the hearing and cannot appear by other reasonably feasible means, the court shall require clear and convincing evidence that the patient is unable to be present at the hearing and on such a finding may proceed with the hearing in the patient's absence.

D. The requirements of subsection B of this section are in addition to all rules of evidence and the Arizona rules of civil procedure, not inconsistent with subsection B of this section.

E. A verbatim record of all proceedings under this section shall be made by stenographic means by a court reporter if a written request for a court reporter is made by any party to the proceedings at least twenty-four hours in advance of such proceedings. If stenographic means are not requested in the manner provided by this subsection, electronic means shall be directed by the presiding judge. The stenographic notes or electronic tape shall be retained as provided by statute.

F. A patient who has been ordered to undergo treatment may request a certified transcript of the hearing. To obtain a copy, the patient shall pay for a transcript or shall file an affidavit that the patient is without means to pay for a transcript. If the affidavit is found true by the court, the expense of the transcript is a charge on the county in which the proceedings were held, or, if an intergovernmental agreement by the counties has required evaluation in a county other than that of the patient's residence, such expense may be charged to the county of the patient's residence or in which the patient was found before evaluation.

 

#### Section 36-540. Court options; immunity; rules

A. If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the proposed patient, as a result of mental disorder, is a danger to self, is a danger to others or has a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability and is in need of treatment, and is either unwilling or unable to accept voluntary treatment, the court shall order the patient to undergo one of the following:

1. Treatment in a program of outpatient treatment.

2. Treatment in a program consisting of combined inpatient and outpatient treatment.

3. Inpatient treatment in a mental health treatment agency, in a hospital operated by or under contract with the United States department of veterans affairs to provide treatment to eligible veterans pursuant to article 9 of this chapter, in the state hospital or in a private hospital, if the private hospital agrees, subject to the limitations of section 36-541.

B. The court shall consider all available and appropriate alternatives for the treatment and care of the patient.  The court shall order the least restrictive treatment alternative available.

C. The court may order the proposed patient to undergo outpatient or combined inpatient and outpatient treatment pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section if the court:

1. Determines that all of the following apply:

(a) The patient does not require continuous inpatient hospitalization.

(b) The patient will be more appropriately treated in an outpatient treatment program or in a combined inpatient and outpatient treatment program.

(c) The patient will follow a prescribed outpatient treatment plan.

(d) The patient will not likely become dangerous or suffer more serious physical harm or serious illness or further deterioration if the patient follows a prescribed outpatient treatment plan.

2. Is presented with and approves a written treatment plan that conforms with the requirements of section 36-540.01, subsection B. If the court determines that the patient meets the requirements of section 36-550.09, the court may order the patient to be placed in a secure behavioral health residential facility that is licensed by the department pursuant to section 36-425.06. If the treatment plan presented to the court pursuant to this subsection provides for supervision of the patient under court order by a mental health agency that is other than the mental health agency that petitioned or requested the county attorney to petition the court for treatment pursuant to section 36-531, the treatment plan must be approved by the medical director of the mental health agency that will supervise the treatment pursuant to subsection E of this section.

D. An order to receive treatment pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section shall not exceed three hundred sixty-five days. The period of inpatient treatment under a combined treatment order pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section shall not exceed the maximum period allowed for an order for inpatient treatment pursuant to subsection F of this section.

E. If the court enters an order for treatment pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section, all of the following apply:

1. The court shall designate the medical director of the mental health treatment agency that will supervise and administer the patient's treatment program.

2. The medical director shall not use the services of any person, agency or organization to supervise a patient's outpatient treatment program unless the person, agency or organization has agreed to provide these services in the individual patient's case and unless the department has determined that the person, agency or organization is capable and competent to do so.

3. The person, agency or organization assigned to supervise an outpatient treatment program or the outpatient portion of a combined treatment program shall be notified at least three days before a referral.  The medical director making the referral and the person, agency or organization assigned to supervise the treatment program shall share relevant information about the patient to provide continuity of treatment.

4. The court may order the medical director to provide notice to the court of any noncompliance with the terms of a treatment order.

5. During any period of outpatient treatment under subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section, if the court, on its own motion or on motion by the medical director of the patient's outpatient mental health treatment facility, determines that the patient is not complying with the terms of the order or that the outpatient treatment plan is no longer appropriate and the patient needs inpatient treatment, the court, without a hearing and based on the court record, the patient's medical record, the affidavits and recommendations of the medical director, and the advice of staff and physicians or the psychiatric and mental health nurse practitioner familiar with the treatment of the patient, may enter an order amending its original order. The amended order may alter the outpatient treatment plan or order the patient to inpatient treatment pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section.  The amended order shall not increase the total period of commitment originally ordered by the court or, when added to the period of inpatient treatment provided by the original order and any other amended orders, exceed the maximum period allowed for an order for inpatient treatment pursuant to subsection F of this section. If the patient refuses to comply with an amended order for inpatient treatment, the court, on its own motion or on the request of the medical director, may authorize and direct a peace officer to take the patient into protective custody and transport the patient to the agency for inpatient treatment. Any authorization, directive or order issued to a peace officer to take the patient into protective custody shall include the patient's criminal history and the name and telephone numbers of the patient's case manager, guardian, spouse, next of kin or significant other, as applicable.  When reporting to or being returned to a treatment agency for inpatient treatment pursuant to an amended order, the patient shall be informed of the patient's right to judicial review and the patient's right to consult with counsel pursuant to section 36-546.

6. During any period of outpatient treatment under subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section, if the medical director of the outpatient treatment facility in charge of the patient's care determines, in concert with the medical director of an inpatient mental health treatment facility who has agreed to accept the patient, that the patient is in need of immediate acute inpatient psychiatric care because of behavior that is dangerous to self or to others, the medical director of the outpatient treatment facility may order a peace officer to apprehend and transport the patient to the inpatient treatment facility pending a court determination on an amended order under paragraph 5 of this subsection.  The patient may be detained and treated at the inpatient treatment facility for a period of not more than forty-eight hours, exclusive of weekends and holidays, from the time that the patient is taken to the inpatient treatment facility. The medical director of the outpatient treatment facility shall file the motion for an amended court order requesting inpatient treatment not later than the next working day following the patient being taken to the inpatient treatment facility.  Any period of detention within the inpatient treatment facility pending issuance of an amended order shall not increase the total period of commitment originally ordered by the court or, when added to the period of inpatient treatment provided by the original order and any other amended orders, exceed the maximum period allowed for an order for inpatient treatment pursuant to subsection F of this section. If a patient is ordered to undergo inpatient treatment pursuant to an amended order, the medical director of the outpatient treatment facility shall inform the patient of the patient's right to judicial review and to consult with an attorney pursuant to section 36-546.

F. The maximum periods of inpatient treatment that the court may order, subject to the limitations of section 36-541, are as follows:

1. Ninety days for a person found to be a danger to self.

2. One hundred eighty days for a person found to be a danger to others.

3. One hundred eighty days for a person found to have a persistent or acute disability.

4. Three hundred sixty-five days for a person found to have a grave disability.

G. If, on finding that the patient meets the criteria for court-ordered treatment pursuant to subsection A of this section, the court also finds that there is reasonable cause to believe that the patient is an incapacitated person as defined in section 14-5101 or is a person in need of protection pursuant to section 14-5401 and that the patient is or may be in need of guardianship or conservatorship, or both, the court may order an investigation concerning the need for a guardian or conservator, or both, and may appoint a suitable person or agency to conduct the investigation. The appointee may include a court-appointed guardian ad litem, an investigator appointed pursuant to section 14-5308 or the public fiduciary if there is no person willing and qualified to act in that capacity.  The court shall give notice of the appointment to the appointee within three days after the appointment. The appointee shall submit the report of the investigation to the court within twenty-one days. The report shall include recommendations as to who should be guardian or who should be conservator, or both, and a report of the findings and reasons for the recommendation. If the investigation and report so indicate, the court shall order the appropriate person to submit a petition to become the guardian or conservator, or both, of the patient.

H. In any proceeding for court-ordered treatment in which the petition alleges that the patient is in need of a guardian or conservator and states the grounds for that allegation, the court may appoint an emergency temporary guardian or conservator, or both, for a specific purpose or purposes identified in its order and for a specific period of time not to exceed thirty days if the court finds that all of the following are true:

1. The patient meets the criteria for court-ordered treatment pursuant to subsection A of this section.

2. There is reasonable cause to believe that the patient is an incapacitated person as defined in section 14-5101 or is in need of protection pursuant to section 14-5401, paragraph 2.

3. The patient does not have a guardian or conservator and the welfare of the patient requires immediate action to protect the patient or the ward's property.

4. The conditions prescribed pursuant to section 14-5310, subsection B or section 14-5401.01, subsection B have been met.

I. The court may appoint as a temporary guardian or conservator pursuant to subsection H of this section a suitable person or the public fiduciary if there is no person qualified and willing to act in that capacity. The court shall issue an order for an investigation as prescribed pursuant to subsection G of this section and, unless the patient is represented by independent counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the patient in further proceedings regarding the appointment of a guardian or conservator. The court shall schedule a further hearing within fourteen days on the appropriate court calendar of a court that has authority over guardianship or conservatorship matters pursuant to this title to consider the continued need for an emergency temporary guardian or conservator and the appropriateness of the temporary guardian or conservator appointed, and shall order the appointed guardian or conservator to give notice to persons entitled to notice pursuant to section 14-5309, subsection A or section 14-5405, subsection A. The court shall authorize certified letters of temporary emergency guardianship or conservatorship to be issued on presentation of a copy of the court's order. If a temporary emergency conservator other than the public fiduciary is appointed pursuant to this subsection, the court shall order that the use of the monies and property of the patient by the conservator be restricted and not be sold, used, transferred or encumbered, except that the court may authorize the conservator to use monies or property of the patient specifically identified as needed to pay an expense to provide for the care, treatment or welfare of the patient pending further hearing.  This subsection and subsection H of this section do not:

1. Prevent the evaluation or treatment agency from seeking guardianship and conservatorship in any other manner allowed by law at any time during the period of court-ordered evaluation and treatment.

2. Relieve the evaluation or treatment agency from its obligations concerning the suspected abuse of a vulnerable adult pursuant to title 46, chapter 4.

J. If, on finding that a patient meets the criteria for court-ordered treatment pursuant to subsection A of this section, the court also learns that the patient has a guardian appointed under title 14, the court with notice may impose on the existing guardian additional duties pursuant to section 14-5312.01. If the court imposes additional duties on an existing guardian as prescribed in this subsection, the court may determine that the patient needs to continue treatment under a court order for treatment and may issue the order or determine that the patient's needs can be adequately met by the guardian with the additional duties pursuant to section 14-5312.01 and decline to issue the court order for treatment. If at any time after the issuance of a court order for treatment the court finds that the patient's needs can be adequately met by the guardian with the additional duties pursuant to section 14-5312.01 and that a court order for treatment is no longer necessary to ensure compliance with necessary treatment, the court may terminate the court order for treatment. If there is a court order for treatment and a guardianship with additional mental health authority pursuant to section 14-5312.01 existing at the same time, the treatment and placement decisions made by the treatment agency assigned by the court to supervise and administer the patient's treatment program pursuant to the court order for treatment are controlling unless the court orders otherwise.

K. The court shall file a report as part of the court record on its findings of alternatives for treatment.

L. Treatment shall not include psychosurgery, lobotomy or any other brain surgery without specific informed consent of the patient or the patient's legal guardian and an order of the superior court in the county in which the treatment is proposed, approving with specificity the use of the treatment.

M. The medical director or any person, agency or organization used by the medical director to supervise the terms of an outpatient treatment plan is not civilly liable for any acts committed by a patient while on outpatient treatment if the medical director, person, agency or organization has in good faith followed the requirements of this section.

N. A peace officer who in good faith apprehends and transports a patient to an inpatient treatment facility on the order of the medical director of the outpatient treatment facility pursuant to subsection E, paragraph 6 of this section is not subject to civil liability.

O. If a person has been found, as a result of a mental disorder, to constitute a danger to self or others or to have a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability and the court enters an order for treatment pursuant to subsection A of this section, the court shall transmit the person's name, sex, date of birth, social security number, if available, and date of the order for treatment to the supreme court.  The supreme court shall transmit the information to the department of public safety to comply with the requirements of title 13, chapter 31 and title 32, chapter 26. The department of public safety shall transmit the information to the national instant criminal background check system.  The superior court may access the information of a person who is ordered into treatment to enforce or facilitate a treatment order.

P. On request, the clerk of the court shall provide certified copies of the commitment order to a law enforcement or prosecuting agency that is investigating or prosecuting a prohibited possessor as defined in section 13-3101.

Q. If the court does not find a person to be in need of treatment and a prosecutor filed a petition pursuant to section 13-4517, the evaluation agency, within twenty-four hours, shall notify the prosecuting agency of its finding. The court shall order the medical director to detain the person for an additional twenty-four hours to allow the prosecuting agency to be notified. If the court has retained jurisdiction pursuant to section 13-4517, subsection C, the court may remand the person to the custody of the sheriff for further disposition pursuant to section 13-4517, subsection A, paragraph 2 or 3.

R. After an order for treatment has been issued pursuant to this section, the superior court in a county where a patient under a court order for treatment is found or resides has concurrent jurisdiction with the court in the county that issued the court order for treatment for the purposes of enforcing the court order for treatment, ordering changes to the treatment plan or amending the order to require the patient to undergo further inpatient treatment. If the court in which proceedings are commenced to enforce or administer the order for treatment is not the court that originally entered the order for treatment, unless prevented by an emergency, the court in which the proceedings are pending shall consult with the court of original entry and determine whether to hold hearings and enter orders to facilitate enforcement or administration of the court order, whether to refer the case back to the court of original entry for further proceedings or whether to transfer the entire case to the court of original entry in that county for all further proceedings.  The supreme court may adopt rules to govern the procedures to be used in enforcing and administering court orders for treatment in the various counties of this state and the transfer of cases between counties involving court orders for treatment.

S. Pursuant to the authority granted in subsection R of this section, for the purpose of enforcing or facilitating treatment of a patient under an active order for treatment, the supreme court shall adopt a rule to establish a program to enable the judges of the superior court, county attorneys, patients' attorneys, the regional behavioral health authority and behavioral health service providers in any county to determine the existence of an active court order for treatment and the history of court orders for treatment entered for a patient by a superior court in any county in this state. The program shall ensure that the information shared with other persons or entities is necessary only for the purposes stated in this subsection and shall require that the information shared be maintained as confidential by the receiving person or entity.

#### Section 36-540.01. Conditional outpatient treatment

A. The medical director may issue an order for conditional outpatient treatment for a patient ordered to undergo treatment pursuant to section 36-540 if, after consultation with staff familiar with the patient's case history, the medical director determines with a reasonable degree of medical probability that all of the following apply:

1. The patient no longer requires continuous inpatient hospitalization.

2. The patient will be more appropriately treated in an outpatient treatment program.

3. The patient will follow a prescribed outpatient treatment plan.

4. The patient will not likely become dangerous, suffer more serious physical harm or serious illness or further deteriorate if the patient follows a prescribed outpatient treatment plan.

B. The order for conditional outpatient treatment issued by the medical director shall include a written outpatient treatment plan prepared by staff familiar with the patient's case history and approved by the medical director. If a petition has been filed pursuant to section 13-4517 the prosecuting agency may provide the court with information that is contained in the patient's criminal history and that may be relevant to protecting the well-being of the patient and the public.  The plan shall include all of the following:

1. A statement of the patient's requirements, if any, for supervision, medication and assistance in obtaining basic needs such as employment, food, clothing or shelter.

2. The address of the residence where the patient is to live and the name of the person in charge of the residence, if any.

3. The name and address of any person, agency or organization assigned to supervise an outpatient treatment plan or care for the patient, and the extent of authority of the person, agency or organization in carrying out the terms of the plan.

4. The conditions for continued outpatient treatment, which may require periodic reporting, continuation of medication and submission to testing, and may restrict travel, consumption of spirituous liquor and drugs, associations with others and incurrence of debts and obligations or such other reasonable conditions as the medical director may specify.

5. Any other provisions that the medical director or the court believes are necessary to protect the well-being of the patient and the public.

C. The court may order that the medical director provide notice to the court of specific instances of noncompliance as specified by the court.

D. Before release for conditional outpatient treatment, the patient shall be provided with copies and full explanations of the medical director's order and the treatment plan. If, after full explanation, the patient objects to the plan or any part of it, the objection and reasons for the objection shall be noted in the patient's record. The medical director's order and treatment plan shall be filed in the patient's medical file and shall also be filed with the court.

E. The period for which conditional outpatient treatment may be ordered may not exceed the remainder of the period of court-ordered treatment.

F. Before the release of a patient for outpatient treatment, the medical director shall give notice pursuant to section 36-541.01, subsection C and a motion for a determination by the court as to whether the standard for conditional release of the patient has been met may be made by the persons and in the manner provided for in section 36-541.01, subsection I. Before the release of a person found to be a danger to self or others or found to have a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability for outpatient treatment, the medical director shall give notice to the court that ordered the patient to undergo treatment.  If criminal charges against a patient involving death or serious physical injury or a violation of title 13, chapter 14 are dismissed pursuant to section 13-4517, the medical director shall notify the prosecuting agency if a civil commitment order issued pursuant to this chapter expires or is terminated, or if the patient is discharged to outpatient treatment.  The medical director shall provide this notice by mail at least five days before the anticipated date of the expiration, termination or discharge.

G. The medical director shall require periodic reports concerning the condition of patients on conditional outpatient treatment from any person, agency or organization assigned to supervise an outpatient treatment plan. The medical director shall require these reports at intervals not to exceed thirty days.

H. The medical director shall review the condition of a patient on conditional outpatient treatment at least once every thirty days and enter the findings in writing in the patient's file. In conducting the review, the medical director shall consider all reports and information received and may require the patient to report for further evaluation.

I. The medical director may amend any part of the outpatient treatment plan during the course of conditional outpatient treatment. If the plan is amended, the medical director shall issue a new order including the amended outpatient treatment plan. The new order and amended outpatient treatment plan shall be filed in the patient's medical file.  Copies of the new order and outpatient treatment plan shall be immediately provided to the patient and to any person, agency or organization assigned to supervise an outpatient treatment plan. Copies of the new order and outpatient treatment plan shall be immediately filed with the court and, if a prosecutor filed a petition pursuant to section 13-4517, with the prosecuting agency.

J. The medical director may rescind an order for conditional outpatient treatment and order the patient to return to a mental health treatment agency at any time during the period of court ordered treatment if, in the medical director's judgment, the patient has failed to comply with a term of the outpatient treatment plan or if, for any reason, the medical director determines that the patient needs inpatient treatment or that conditional outpatient treatment is no longer appropriate. The medical director shall give notice to the court that issued the treatment order and the prosecuting agency if a prosecutor filed a petition pursuant to section 13-4517.

K. If the medical director rescinds an order for conditional outpatient treatment and the patient is returned to a mental health treatment agency for inpatient treatment, the patient shall be informed of the patient's right to judicial review and right to consult with counsel pursuant to section 36-546.

L. If the medical director rescinds an order for conditional outpatient treatment and orders the patient to return to a mental health treatment agency, the medical director may request, or a court may order, a peace officer or a designated officer or employee of the treatment agency to take the patient into custody for immediate delivery to the agency pursuant to section 36-544.

M. The medical director is not civilly liable for any act committed by a patient while on conditional outpatient treatment if the medical director has in good faith followed the requirements of this section.

N. This section does not prevent the medical director from authorizing a patient ordered to undergo treatment pursuant to section 36-540 as a danger to self or a danger to others or a patient with a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability to leave the treatment agency for periods of no more than five days under the care, custody and control of a spouse, relative or other responsible person if the medical director determines that the patient will not become dangerous or suffer serious physical harm or illness during that time.

O. The medical director may authorize a patient who is civilly committed pursuant to section 36-540 to leave the state hospital grounds unaccompanied if the leave is part of an inpatient individualized treatment and discharge plan and the medical director determines that the patient will not become dangerous or suffer serious physical harm or illness during that time.

#### Section 36-540.02. Transfer of a person with a grave disability without a guardian from a mental health treatment agency to another health care facility

A. A person who does not have a guardian under section 14-5312.01 and who has been found by the court to have a grave disability and ordered to undergo treatment pursuant to this article may receive care in another health care institution licensed by the department during the course of the person's court-ordered treatment in accordance with administration rules.

B. The director shall adopt rules pertaining to persons described in subsection A of this section to provide for their alternative care in another health care institution licensed by the department during the course of court-ordered treatment. The rules shall allow transfer of patients from a mental health treatment agency to another health care institution, transfer from one such institution to another and return to a mental health treatment agency.

 

#### Section 36-541. Mandatory local treatment; placement at state hospital

A. A patient who is ordered by a court to undergo treatment and who is not hospitalized in the state hospital at the time of the order shall undergo treatment for at least twenty-five days in a local mental health treatment agency that is geographically convenient for the patient before being hospitalized in the state hospital. This section does not apply if the court finds, at a hearing on court-ordered treatment, that the patient's present condition and history demonstrate that the patient will not benefit from the required period of treatment in a local mental health treatment agency or that the state hospital provides a program that is specific to the needs of the patient and is unavailable in the local mental health treatment agency, or when there is no local mental health treatment agency readily available to the patient. Such a finding shall be based at least on the annual written description by the state hospital of programs and services available and appropriate written reports from the medical director of the local mental health treatment agency. The patient may be immediately hospitalized at the state hospital whenever the court determines that this section does not apply.

B. A patient who is ordered by a court to undergo treatment may be admitted for treatment if the patient is accepted by the superintendent of the state hospital for treatment at the state hospital or if the court orders placement at the state hospital pursuant to subsection A or C of this section.

C. During any period of court-ordered treatment, the medical director of the local mental health treatment agency assigned to supervise and administer the patient's treatment program may file a motion requesting the court to amend the treatment order to place the patient for treatment at the state hospital. After a hearing, if the court finds that the patient's present condition and history demonstrate that the patient will not benefit from a continued period of treatment in or by a local mental health treatment agency, either as an inpatient or an outpatient, or that the state hospital provides a program that is specific to the needs of the patient and is unavailable in a local mental health treatment agency, and that the least restrictive placement to meet the needs of the patient for the foreseeable future is placement in the state hospital and there is a legally available funded bed in the state hospital, the court may amend the original treatment order authorizing the placement of the patient at the state hospital pursuant to section 36-540, subsection A, paragraph 2 or 3.  Within five days after receiving notice from the court, the superintendent shall notify the court whether a bed is available in the state hospital.

#### Section 36-541.01. Release or discharge from treatment before expiration of period ordered by court; notification of intent to release or discharge; hearing; immunity

A. A patient who is found to have a grave disability or a persistent or acute disability and who is ordered to undergo treatment pursuant to this article may be released from inpatient treatment when, in the opinion of the medical director of the mental health treatment agency, the level of care offered by the agency is no longer required. The patient may agree to continue treatment voluntarily. If the patient is to be released, the medical director shall arrange for an appropriate alternative placement. If the patient who is to be released from inpatient treatment is under a guardianship, the medical director of the mental health treatment agency shall notify the guardian and any relevant regional behavioral health authority ten days before the intended release date that the patient no longer requires the level of care that is offered by the agency. The guardian and, if relevant, the regional behavioral health authority shall arrange alternative placement with the advice and recommendations of the medical director of the mental health treatment agency.

B. A patient who is ordered to undergo treatment pursuant to this article may be released from treatment before the expiration of the period ordered by the court if, in the opinion of the medical director of the mental health treatment agency, the patient no longer is, as a result of a mental disorder, a danger to others or a danger to self or no longer has a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability.  A person who is ordered to undergo treatment as a danger to others or who has had a petition filed by a prosecutor pursuant to section 13-4517 may not be released or discharged from treatment before the expiration of the period for treatment ordered by the court unless the medical director first gives notice of intention to do so as provided by this section.

C. Before the release or discharge of a patient who is ordered to undergo treatment, the medical director of the mental health treatment agency shall notify the following of the medical director's intention to release or discharge the patient:

1. The presiding judge of the court that entered the order for treatment.

2. Any relative or victim of the patient who has filed a demand for notice with the treatment agency.

3. Any person found by the court to have a legitimate reason for receiving notice.

D. If the patient is undergoing court-ordered treatment as the result of a petition filed by a prosecuting agency pursuant to section 13-4517, the medical director of the mental health treatment agency shall notify the court and the prosecuting agency if a civil commitment order issued pursuant to this chapter expires or is terminated, or if the patient is discharged to outpatient treatment.  The medical director shall provide this notice by mail at least five days before the anticipated date of the expiration, termination or discharge.  This subsection does not apply to amended orders that are a result of the patient's need for acute or emergency care during the period of court-ordered treatment.

E. If the medical director of the mental health treatment agency is unable to determine, based on the information submitted pursuant to subsection F of this section, that a person who has filed a demand for notice is a victim, the medical director shall inform that person that that person's demand for notice is denied and that notice will not be given unless ordered by the court pursuant to subsection G of this section.

F. A demand for notice by a relative or victim, and a petition for notice by other persons, shall be on a form prescribed by the administration and shall include the following information:

1. The full name of the person to receive notice.

4. The relationship to the patient, if any, or the reasons why the person believes the person has a legitimate reason to receive notice.

5. A statement that the person will advise the treatment agency in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested, of any change in the address to which notice is to be mailed.

6. The full name of the patient who is ordered to undergo treatment as a danger to others or who has had a petition filed by a prosecutor pursuant to section 13-4517.

7. The mental health number assigned to the case by the superior court.

G. If the court receives a demand for notice by a relative or victim, the court shall order the medical director of the mental health treatment agency not to release or discharge the patient before the expiration of the period of court-ordered treatment without first giving notice to the relative or victim as provided in subsection H of this section. After considering a petition for notice, if the court finds that the petitioner has a legitimate reason for receiving prior notice, the court may order the medical director of the mental health treatment agency not to release or discharge the patient from inpatient treatment before the expiration of the period of court-ordered treatment without first giving notice to the petitioner as provided in subsection H of this section. Any order for notice shall be delivered to the mental health treatment agency and shall be filed with the patient's clinical record.  If the patient is transferred to another agency or institution, any orders for notice shall be transferred with the patient.

H. A notice of intention to release or discharge shall include the following information:

1. The name of the patient to be released or discharged.

2. The type of release or discharge.

3. The date of anticipated release or discharge.  Notices shall be placed in the mail, postage prepaid and addressed to the court and to each person for whom notice has been ordered, at least ten days before the date of intended release or discharge, except that notice shall be sent to the prosecuting agency at least five days before the date of intended release or discharge. For purposes of computing the notice requirement, the day of mailing shall not be counted.

I. Any person for whom prior notice is required pursuant to this section, or the court, may make a motion within the notification period that requires the court to determine whether the standard for release of the patient before the expiration of the period for court-ordered treatment has been met. A determination that the standard for release has been met may be made by the court based on a review of the record and any affidavits submitted without further hearing. For good cause, the court may order an evidentiary hearing. Whether or not a hearing is held, the court shall make a determination at the earliest possible time but no longer than three weeks after the anticipated date of release pursuant to subsection H of this section, and the patient shall be retained for the additional time required for the court's determination. In making its determination the court may order an independent examination of the patient. If a motion is not made, the patient may be released in accordance with the terms set forth in the notice without further court order. If a hearing is held pursuant to this subsection, the court shall order the medical director of the mental health treatment agency to provide the patient's records, including medical and treatment records, to the court and the prosecuting agency.

J. If a motion has not been made pursuant to subsection I of this section, the patient may be released or discharged and the medical director of the mental health treatment agency shall send to the court a certificate that the patient is no longer a danger to others or a danger to self or no longer has a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability as the result of a mental disorder and therefore is released before the expiration of the period ordered for treatment. The court shall enter an order terminating the patient's court-ordered treatment.

K. The medical director of the mental health treatment agency shall not be held civilly liable for any acts committed by a patient who is released before the expiration of the period of court-ordered treatment if the medical director has in good faith followed the requirements of this section.

 

#### Section 36-542. Discharge of patient at expiration of period ordered by court; change to voluntary status; immunity

A. A patient ordered by a court to undergo treatment pursuant to this article shall be discharged from treatment at the expiration of the period of treatment ordered unless one of the following occurs:

1. The person accepts voluntary treatment at the mental health treatment agency.

2. Before the discharge date, a new petition is filed in the county in which the patient is being treated. The proceedings shall then be governed by this article. The costs of the proceedings shall be a charge against the county in which the patient resided or was found prior to hospitalization.

3. An application for continued court-ordered treatment is granted pursuant to section 36-543.

B. If a patient to be discharged is under guardianship, the medical director of the mental health treatment agency shall notify the guardian ten days before discharge.

C. If a patient to be discharged is undergoing court-ordered treatment as a result of a petition filed by a prosecutor pursuant to section 13-4517 and the patient is being discharged because the medical director has decided not to file a new petition for court-ordered evaluation or treatment or has decided not to request the court to order that the previous order for treatment be continued, the patient may not be discharged or released from treatment before compliance with section 36-541.01.

D. The medical director is not civilly liable for any acts committed by a released or discharged patient if the medical director has in good faith followed the requirements of this article.

 

#### Section 36-543. Annual review of a patient with a grave disability or a persistent or acute disability; notice; court order for continued treatment; rules; immunity

A. Within ninety days before the expiration of a court order for treatment, the medical director of the mental health treatment agency shall conduct an annual review of a patient who has been found to have a grave disability or a persistent or acute disability and who is undergoing court-ordered treatment to determine whether the continuation of court-ordered treatment is appropriate and to assess the needs of the patient for guardianship or conservatorship, or both. The annual review shall consist of the mental health treatment and clinical records contained in the patient's treatment file.  The mental health treatment agency shall keep a record of the annual review. If the medical director believes that a continuation of court-ordered treatment is appropriate, the medical director of the mental health treatment agency shall appoint one or more psychiatrists to carry out a psychiatric examination of the patient. In any proceeding conducted pursuant to this section, a patient has the right to have an analysis of the patient's mental condition by an independent evaluation pursuant to section 36-538.

B. Each examiner participating in the psychiatric examination of the patient shall submit a report to the medical director of the mental health treatment agency that includes the following:

1. The examiner's opinions as to whether the patient continues to have a grave disability or a persistent or acute disability as the result of a mental disorder and be in need of continued court-ordered treatment. In evaluating the patient's need for continued court-ordered treatment, the examiner must consider, along with all other evidence, the patient's history before and during the current period of court-ordered treatment, the patient's compliance with recommended treatment and any other evidence relevant to the patient's ability and willingness to follow recommended treatment with or without a court order.

2. A statement as to whether suitable alternatives to court-ordered treatment are available.

3. A statement as to whether voluntary treatment would be appropriate.

4. A review of the patient's status as to guardianship or conservatorship, or both, the adequacy of existing protections of the patient and the continued need for guardianship or conservatorship, or both. If the examiner concludes that the patient's needs in these areas are not being adequately met, the examiner's report shall recommend that the court order an investigation into the patient's needs.

5. If the patient has an existing guardian who does not have the mental health powers authorized pursuant to section 14-5312.01, a recommendation as to whether the additional mental health powers authorized by section 14-5312.01 should be imposed on the existing guardian and whether the patient's needs can be adequately addressed by a guardian with mental health powers without the need for a court order for treatment or whether the court order for treatment should continue regardless of the additional mental health powers imposed on the guardian.

6. The results of any physical examination conducted during the period of court-ordered treatment if relevant to the psychiatric condition of the patient.

C. After conducting the annual review as prescribed in this section, if the medical director believes that continued court-ordered treatment is necessary or appropriate, not later than thirty days before the expiration of the court order for treatment, the medical director shall file with the court an application for continued court-ordered treatment alleging the basis for the application and shall file simultaneously with the application any psychiatric examination conducted as part of the annual review. If the patient is under guardianship, the medical director shall mail a copy of the application to the patient's guardian.

D. If an application for continued court-ordered treatment is filed, all of the following apply:

1. If the patient does not have an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the patient.

2. Within ten days after appointment, an attorney appointed pursuant to this subsection, to the extent possible, shall fulfill the duties imposed pursuant to section 36-537, review the medical director's report and the patient's medical records, interview any physician who prepared a report on the annual review and file a response requesting a hearing or submitting the matter to the court for a ruling based on the record without a hearing.

3. If a hearing is not requested, the court shall rule on the application or set the matter for hearing.  If a hearing is requested, the hearing shall be held within three weeks after the request for hearing is filed.  The hearing may be continued for good cause on motion of a party or on the court's own motion, and the expiration of the current court order for treatment may be extended until a ruling by the court on an application filed pursuant to this subsection.

4. The patient's attorney must be present at all hearings and may subpoena and cross-examine witnesses and present evidence.  The patient has the right to attend all hearings, but may choose not to attend a hearing.  The patient's attorney may waive the patient's presence after speaking with the patient and confirming that the patient understands the right to be present and does not desire to attend. If the patient is unable to be present at the hearing for medical or psychiatric reasons and the hearing cannot be conducted where the patient is being treated or confined, or the patient cannot appear by another reasonably feasible means, the court shall require clear and convincing evidence that the patient is unable to be present at the hearing and on such a finding may proceed with the hearing in the patient's absence.

5. The evidence presented by the applicant includes the testimony of one or more witnesses acquainted with the patient during the period of court-ordered treatment, which may be satisfied by a statement agreed on by the parties, and the testimony of any physician who performed an annual review of the patient, which may be satisfied by stipulating to the admission of the examining physicians' written report prepared pursuant to subsection B of this section.  The court may waive the need for the applicant to present the testimony of witnesses acquainted with the patient as required by this subsection, if it finds that the need for a continued court order for treatment has been established by clear and convincing evidence from the other testimony and evidence presented at the hearing.

6. At a hearing held pursuant to this subsection, the court, with notice, may impose on an existing guardian additional powers pursuant to section 14-5312.01. If the court finds that the patient's needs can be adequately met by an existing guardian with the additional powers pursuant to section 14-5312.01 and that a court order for treatment is not necessary to ensure compliance with necessary treatment, the court may terminate the court order for treatment or decline to issue an order continuing court-ordered treatment. The court may also order an investigation into the need for guardianship or conservatorship, or both, and may appoint a suitable person or agency to conduct the investigation. The appointee may include a court-appointed guardian ad litem, a court-appointed investigator pursuant to section 14-5308 or the public fiduciary if there is no person willing and qualified to act in that capacity. The court shall give notice of the appointment to the appointee within three days after the appointment. The appointee shall submit the report of the investigation to the court within twenty-one days. The report shall include recommendations as to who should be guardian or conservator, or both, and the findings and reasons for the recommendation.  If the investigation and report so indicate, the court may authorize an appropriate person to file a petition for appointment of a guardian or conservator for the patient.

E. If a hearing is held pursuant to subsection D of this section, the party seeking the renewal of the court order must prove all of the following by clear and convincing evidence:

1. The patient continues to have a mental disorder and, as a result of that disorder, has either a persistent or acute disability or a grave disability.

2. The patient is in need of continued court-ordered treatment.

3. The patient is either unwilling or unable to accept treatment voluntarily.

F. After a hearing held pursuant to subsection D of this section, the court may order the patient to be released from court-ordered treatment or to undergo continued court-ordered treatment for a period not to exceed the time periods prescribed in section 36-540, subsection D.

G. The director shall create and operate a program to ensure that the examination and review of persons with grave disabilities or persistent or acute disabilities under court order are carried out in an effective and timely manner. The director shall adopt rules needed to operate this program.

H. The medical director of the mental health treatment agency is not civilly liable for any acts committed by the released patient if the medical director has in good faith complied with the requirements of this article.

 

#### Section 36-544. Unauthorized absences; violation; classification; tolling period; hearing; civil liability; definition

A. When any patient who is being evaluated or treated is absent without proper authorization from an evaluation agency or a mental health treatment agency, or when an order for outpatient treatment is rescinded, any peace officer shall, upon oral or written request of the medical director of the agency and without the necessity of a warrant or court order, or any officer or employee of the agency who has been previously designated in writing by the medical director of the agency to perform such duties may, take into custody and deliver such patient to the agency. Such officers and employees of the agency have the powers and duties of peace officers so far as is necessary to carry out the provisions of this section. If necessary, the evaluation or treatment agency may apply to the court for a warrant or court order directing any peace officer to take a patient who is absent without proper authorization into custody and deliver the patient to the agency.

B. Any person who intentionally assists any patient being evaluated or treated in an agency to be absent from the agency without proper authorization, or who intentionally assists a patient whom he knows to be absent without proper authorization or whom he knows to be a patient whose order for outpatient treatment has been rescinded and who has been ordered to return to the agency, or to resist being returned to the agency after such absence is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor.

C. The period of court-ordered treatment is tolled during the unauthorized absence of the patient.  Within five days after a patient's unauthorized absence, the treatment agency shall file a notice with the court and provide the date that absence began and request that the treatment order be tolled. If the court tolls the period of court-ordered treatment, notice of the order must be provided to the patient by regular mail at the patient's last known address. If the patient is undergoing treatment as a result of a remand pursuant to section 13-4517, notice must also be provided to the prosecuting attorney.  The treatment agency shall notify the court of the date of the patient's return.  On notice of the patient's return, the court shall issue an order that provides the time period that was tolled.

D. A patient whose period of court-ordered treatment is tolled for a period of at least sixty continuous days may request a judicial review pursuant to section 36-546 on the patient's voluntary or involuntary return to treatment.  During the period tolled by a court order issued pursuant to this section, the treatment agency shall use information and other resources that are available to the agency to facilitate efforts to locate and return the patient to appropriate treatment. At least once every sixty days, or as often as otherwise ordered by the court, the treatment agency shall file with the court a report that specifies the information and resources that were used by the agency to facilitate the agency's efforts. After the period of treatment is tolled for a period of one hundred eighty days, if the court is satisfied that the agency has made the efforts that are required by this subsection, on petition of the treatment agency, the court may terminate the order for treatment or may order the treatment agency to make further specific efforts to locate and return the patient to appropriate treatment. For a patient who has had a petition filed by a prosecutor pursuant to section 13-4517, the treatment agency shall provide notice to the prosecuting agency of the petition to terminate treatment.

E. The period of treatment under a court order may not be tolled for more than three hundred sixty-five days.

F. If the treatment agency has in good faith followed the requirements of this section, the treatment agency is not liable in a civil action for damages that result from the actions of a patient during any period of treatment tolled by an order issued pursuant to this section.

G. For the purposes of this section, "absent without proper authorization" or "unauthorized absence" includes being absent from an inpatient treatment facility without authorization, no longer living in a placement or residence specified by the treatment plan without authorization and leaving or failing to return to the county or state without authorization.

 

### Article 6 - Costs and Services

#### Section 36-545. Voluntary admissions to the state hospital; reimbursements; indigents

The director shall establish the amount which will fully reimburse the state for the expense of examining, evaluating, treating and maintaining the patient. The state hospital shall charge the patient all or such portion of the established amount as the patient can afford. If the patient is indigent, no charge shall be made. The state hospital shall require prompt payment of the charge.

#### Section 36-545.01. Payment of costs and expenses; ability to pay; power and duty of court; acceptance of other benefits; per capita cost limitation; guardians; parental liability; lien; duty of county attorney

A. When a patient is admitted to the state hospital for court-ordered treatment pursuant to article 5 of this chapter or pursuant to section 13-3992, the business manager of the state hospital shall inquire into the ability of the patient to pay the costs of examination, maintenance and treatment. The business manager shall file with the clerk of the court a written report of the manager's findings and the basis of those findings.

B. If the patient is able to pay all or any portion of the charges, the court shall order the payment of the amount the patient can afford of the per capita cost for examination, treatment and maintenance as estimated by the superintendent. The court, on petition of an interested person and at a hearing of which all concerned parties have received notice, may increase or decrease the maintenance charge payable by the patient or the patient's estate.

C. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, any federal, state, public or private medical benefits that are payable to the state hospital where the patient is receiving care and treatment or that are payable to the patient may be accepted by the state hospital without a court order, except that the state hospital shall not accept any benefits that alone or in addition to any amounts payable pursuant to subsection B of this section exceed the per capita cost for the patient.

D. The court, if necessary, may appoint a conservator of the patient to carry out this section. If a conservator is appointed, the clerk of the court shall file a certificate so stating.

H. The standards for determining the assignment for the applicant to a particular service shall be in the best interest of the client, taking into consideration the age, the degree or type of developmental disability, the presence of other disabling conditions of the applicant, the ability to provide the applicant with the maximum opportunity to develop the person's maximum potential, to provide a minimally structured residential program and environment for the applicant and to provide a safe, secure and dependable residential and program environment for the applicant and the particular desires of the applicant.  In making this determination, the placement evaluation team shall consider the reports of all previous placement-type evaluations performed for such applicant, the medical and program history of the applicant and the services and programs available from this state, contractors of this state and other providers.

I. After the placement evaluation report has been issued and the responsible person accepts the assignment of all programs or services, the department shall enroll the applicant in the programs or services within thirty days, subject to the provisions of subsection B of this section.

L. Application for admission shall be one of the following types:

1. "Regular admission" for placement of a person with a developmental disability for developmental disabilities programs and services after a placement evaluation has been conducted for such person.

2. "Emergency admission" for placement of a person with a developmental disability when there is an immediate and compelling need for short-term developmental disabilities programs and services.

M. Regular admission shall be permitted only after a placement evaluation has been conducted and only if space is available at the facility or in the program or service in which placement is requested.

The order shall be served on the afflicted person or, if a minor or incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian by a person who is employed by or under contract to the department, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer or by any sheriff, peace officer or person authorized to serve process. If personal service cannot be performed despite the exercise of due diligence, the order may be served by certified mail, return receipt requested. An affidavit of service that details the procedures followed in serving the order shall be prepared and maintained in the case file of the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer.

D. An order to cooperate issued pursuant to this section shall include a statement that, unless the afflicted person complies with the actions required in the order, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer may order the afflicted person to be taken into emergency custody and shall seek a court order for compulsory examination, monitoring, treatment, isolation or quarantine. The order to cooperate shall also state that if a court order is sought, the afflicted person to whom the order is issued has the right to notice and a hearing and other rights as provided by law.

E. If the afflicted person refuses to comply with an order issued pursuant to this section or if the tuberculosis control officer or local health officer knows that an afflicted person has previously failed or refused to comply with an appropriate prescribed course of medication, treatment or monitoring, and if the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the afflicted person poses a substantial danger to another person or the community and that emergency custody is necessary to prevent a substantial danger to another person or the community, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer may issue an emergency custody order directing a sheriff or law enforcement officer to take the afflicted person into custody, to take precautions reasonable and necessary under the circumstances to protect the health of law enforcement officers and to oversee and ensure the transport of the afflicted person to an institution or facility specified in the order. If the afflicted person's condition or the institution's or facility's location or hours make transportation impracticable, the afflicted person shall be transported to an institution or facility designated by the department, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer.  The order may be an oral order followed by the issuance of a written order by the end of the next business day.  The receiving institution or facility shall provide suitable housing and care of the afflicted person.  At the option of the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer, an afflicted person may be transported by a health care provider, emergency medical services personnel, a physician, ambulance personnel, an ambulance service, guardian, conservator, parent, custodian, relative or friend to a designated institution or facility.  A sheriff or law enforcement agency shall maintain custody of the afflicted person until the afflicted person is delivered to the institution or facility specified in the order or to an alternate institution or facility approved by the department, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer.

F. The admitting officer of an institution or facility that receives an afflicted person pursuant to subsection E of this section shall admit the afflicted person as an emergency patient and shall perform an examination to determine if the afflicted person must be isolated.

G. An afflicted person admitted pursuant to an emergency custody order shall be released from custody if the medical director of the receiving institution or facility, with the advice and consent of the tuberculosis control officer or a local health officer, determines that the afflicted person is any of the following:

1. Not afflicted with active tuberculosis.

2. Not a danger to another person or to the community and release is appropriate.

3. Qualified for release as a voluntary patient.

H. If an afflicted person is admitted pursuant to an emergency custody order, the tuberculosis control officer, the local health officer or a designated legal representative shall file a petition for public health protection within three business days after the detention unless the afflicted person has been accepted as a voluntary patient. The petition shall conform to the requirements of section 36-726.

I. At the time an afflicted person is taken into emergency custody pursuant to this section, the tuberculosis control officer or local health officer, within the limits of due diligence, shall promptly notify the afflicted person's physician, parent or guardian or an adult member of the afflicted person's family of the detention. The notification shall include the location of the detention, the terms and conditions of custody and the authority that ordered the afflicted person's detention. An afflicted person detained under this section or, if a minor or incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian shall be informed by the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer of the afflicted person's rights under this article, including the right to consult with an attorney and the right to have an attorney appointed by the court if the afflicted person cannot afford to employ an attorney. The afflicted person or, if a minor or incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian shall also be advised that if a petition for public health protection is filed the court shall appoint an attorney to consult with and to represent the afflicted person if the afflicted person cannot afford to employ an attorney.

J. If the afflicted person is a minor or incapacitated person, the tuberculosis control officer or local health officer shall use reasonable efforts to locate, contact and confer with a parent or guardian prior to initiating an intervention pursuant to this article.

K. In the event a parent or guardian of an afflicted person who is a minor or an incapacitated person cannot be located or the parent or guardian is unwilling to consent to a recommended intervention pursuant to this article, the tuberculosis control officer or local health officer, for the purpose of protecting the public health, may initiate any intervention that does not prescribe medical treatment for the minor or the incapacitated person unless medical treatment is otherwise authorized by section  14-5209, 14-5312, 44-132 or 44-133.

L. A petition for public health protection shall be filed with the clerk of the superior court within three business days after the afflicted person's emergency detention authorized pursuant to an order of the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer. A petition filed pursuant to this subsection shall conform to the requirements of section 36-726. If a petition for public health protection is not filed within three business days after the detention, the afflicted person shall be immediately released from custody. An afflicted person who is released for this reason shall not be returned to emergency custody by a subsequent order unless the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer first obtains an order from the superior court that permits detention pursuant to this article.

M. This section does not allow a private or public facility or agency to forcibly or involuntarily administer medications to an afflicted person unless authorized by the written order of the superior court pursuant to this article or as otherwise permitted by law.

 

#### Section 36-726. Petition for court ordered examination, monitoring, treatment, isolation or quarantine

A. The tuberculosis control officer, the local health officer or a designated legal representative may petition the superior court for court ordered examination, monitoring, treatment, isolation or quarantine of an afflicted person who presents a substantial danger to another person or to the community and who has failed to comply with a voluntary treatment plan or a written order to cooperate. The petition may be brought in the county where the afflicted person resides or is physically located. The petition shall be in the form and manner approved by the director.

B. The petition shall include:

1. The afflicted person's name, address, date of birth and physical location or last known address. The petitioner may refer to the afflicted person by a pseudonym if specifically requested by the afflicted person.

2. A statement containing the grounds and underlying facts demonstrating that the person is an afflicted person.

3. A statement that the afflicted person has failed to comply with a voluntary treatment plan or an order to cooperate or has a history of noncompliance with an appropriate prescribed course of medication or other interventions.

4. A statement containing the grounds and underlying facts demonstrating that the afflicted person presents a substantial danger to another person or to the community.

5. The least restrictive alternatives to court ordered examination, monitoring, treatment, isolation or quarantine that are appropriate or available.

6. A statement identifying the afflicted person as a minor or an incapacitated person, if applicable, and any facts that could assist the court to determine if the provisions of section 36-730 apply.

C. If the petitioner determines that the afflicted person's health is likely to deteriorate before a court hearing can begin, the petition shall include a statement containing the afflicted person's current clinical condition and a request for an immediate order from the court authorizing the administration of medically necessary treatment to preserve the afflicted person's medical condition before a hearing on the petition.

D. The petitioner shall inform the court when the afflicted person's medical condition may require the court to adjust the conditions and circumstances to accommodate the afflicted person's condition pursuant to section 36-725.

E. The petition shall be accompanied by the affidavit or affidavits of the person who conducted the investigation and by the affidavit or affidavits of the petitioner or intervenors. The affidavits shall detail the evidence that indicates that the person is an afflicted person and evidence that indicates that the afflicted person is a substantial danger to another person or to the community. The petition shall include a summary of the facts that support the allegations of the petition.

F. The petition shall request the court to issue an immediate order authorizing the compulsory detention and continued detention of the afflicted person in a designated facility for supervised monitoring, treatment, isolation or quarantine pending a detention hearing on the petition for public health protection. This detention hearing shall be conducted within fifteen days after a petition for public health protection is filed in the superior court.

G. Before the superior court has an opportunity to rule on the petition's merits, the court may order the immediate or continued detention of the afflicted person in an institution approved by the department, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer if the court determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the afflicted person is likely to be a substantial danger to another person or to the community.

H. If the court orders that the afflicted person be immediately detained, the court shall issue orders necessary to provide for the apprehension, transportation and detention of the afflicted person pending the outcome of the detention hearing and shall provide notice of detention to the afflicted person's physician, or, if the afflicted person is a minor or an incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian, or if none, the next of kin. The court shall appoint an attorney for the afflicted person if one has not been appointed.

I. If after reviewing the petition and supporting documents and other evidence the court determines that the petition and supporting documentation and evidence submitted to the court do not support a finding that the person is an afflicted person or is a substantial danger to another person or the community, the court shall issue a written order to release the person as soon as reasonably possible.

J. If after a petition has been filed and before the hearing the petitioner or the medical director of the receiving institution, with the advice and consent of the tuberculosis control officer or local health officer, determines that the person is not an afflicted person, the petitioner shall withdraw the petition and the petitioner or the medical director of the receiving institution shall discharge the person as soon as reasonably possible.

K. If after a petition has been filed and before the hearing the petitioner or the medical director of the receiving facility, with the advice and consent of the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer, determines that the afflicted person will voluntarily comply with the orders of the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer, the petitioner may request the court to hold the petition in abeyance pending satisfactory compliance by the afflicted person with the terms of the voluntary treatment plan. The court shall not hold the petition in abeyance for longer than six months. Prior to the end of six months, the petitioner may request the court to continue holding the petition in abeyance for a period of time specified by the court.

L. A detention hearing shall be held within fifteen days after the petition is filed with the clerk of the superior court unless:

1. The court determines for good cause shown that a continuance of the detention hearing is necessary in the interests of public health. For the purposes of this paragraph, "good cause" includes the unavailability of necessary witnesses or that additional time is necessary to receive and interpret laboratory test results.

2. The afflicted person or, if a minor or incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian, on consultation with an attorney, determines that it would be in the afflicted person's best interest to request a continuance.

M. A continuance granted to any party by the court pursuant to subsection L of this section shall not exceed thirty days unless the parties agree to an additional continuance.

N. The purpose of a detention hearing is to determine if the afflicted person has tuberculosis. The burden of proof is on the petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence that detention is necessary because the person is an afflicted person and is a substantial danger to another person or to the community.

O. At any time before the hearing the department may intervene as a party to any proceedings pursuant to this section by filing a written notice of intervention with the clerk of the superior court in the county in which the petition is filed. The intervenor may cross-examine any witnesses presented by the other parties, subpoena and present witnesses of its own, including physicians and infectious disease experts, and present evidence. On stipulation with all parties or on order of the court, the intervenor may have physicians conduct physical examinations of the afflicted person and offer testimony as to whether the person has active tuberculosis or is a substantial danger to another person or to the community and offer testimony as to the least restrictive examination, treatment, monitoring, isolation or quarantine alternatives available to the court.

P. Within five days after the filing of a petition for public health protection, the petitioner shall serve on the afflicted person or, if a minor or incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian a copy of the petition and affidavits in support of it and the notice of the hearing. The notice shall inform the afflicted person of the purpose of the hearing and the right to an attorney. If the afflicted person has not employed an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney at least seven days before the hearing. The notice shall fix the date, time and place for the hearing. The notice requirements of this section cannot be waived.

Q. At least five days before the court conducts the hearing on the petition or within a reasonable time after the appointment of a court appointed attorney, copies of the petition, affidavits in support of it, the notice of the hearing, the investigation reports, the afflicted person's medical records and copies of other exhibits shall be made available by the petitioner to the afflicted person or, if a minor or incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian or that person's attorney for examination and reproduction.

R. A person has the right to have an evaluation performed by an independent physician. This evaluation shall include a physical examination and laboratory analysis. If the afflicted person is unable to afford an examination the court shall appoint an independent evaluator acceptable to the afflicted person from a list of licensed physicians who are willing to accept court appointed evaluations. The afflicted person may require the independent physician who performed the evaluation to appear as a witness at a hearing conducted pursuant to this section.

#### Section 36-727. Hearings; procedure; confidentiality

A. The afflicted person or, if a minor or incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian and that person's attorney have the right to be present at all hearings, subject to any conditions or procedures that are deemed appropriate or necessary by order of the court to protect the health and safety of all participants. The afflicted person may waive any appearance before the court.

B. If the afflicted person is unable or unwilling to be present at the hearing or the hearing cannot be reasonably conducted where the afflicted person is being treated or confined or cannot be reasonably conducted in the afflicted person's presence, the court shall enter a finding and may proceed with the hearing on the merits of the petition.

C. The court may impose conditions or procedures that it deems necessary to protect the health and safety of all participants in the hearing and to ensure humane treatment with due regard to the comfort and safety of the afflicted person and others. These measures may include video or telephonic conference appearances. If necessary the court shall provide language interpreters and persons skilled in communicating with vision impaired and hearing impaired persons pursuant to applicable law.

D. Parties to the proceedings may present evidence and subpoena and cross-examine witnesses. The evidence presented may include the testimony of experts on infectious diseases or public health matters or a physician who performed an examination or evaluation of the afflicted person. The petitioner may prove its case on the affidavit or affidavits filed in support of the initial petition. The clinical record of the afflicted person for the current admission shall be available and may be presented in full or in part as evidence at the request of the court, the afflicted person or the afflicted person's attorney or any party in interest.

E. At the hearing the court shall be advised of any drugs known to have been administered to the afflicted person before the hearing that would affect the afflicted person's judgment or behavior.

F. Persons appointed to conduct an examination and evaluation of the afflicted person shall make their reports in writing to the court. The reports shall include a recommendation as to the least restrictive alternative measures available to the court.

G. A verbatim record of all proceedings under this section shall be made by stenographic or electronic means. The stenographic notes or electronic tape shall be retained as provided by statute.

H. The court hearing shall not be open to the public and all records, notices, exhibits and other evidence are confidential and shall not be released to the public. The court may order any portion released or a public hearing to be held on a request from the afflicted person or, if a minor or incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian or the afflicted person's attorney. The court's records and exhibits are available to the petitioner, the afflicted person, the department, the tuberculosis control officer, the local health officer or a legal representative of any of these persons or agencies.

I. An afflicted person who is ordered by the court to undergo examination, monitoring, treatment, isolation or quarantine or, if a minor or incapacitated person, the afflicted person's parent or guardian may request a certified transcript of the hearing. To obtain a copy the person shall pay for the transcript or shall file an affidavit that the afflicted person cannot afford to pay for a transcript. If the affidavit is found true by the court, the court shall charge the expense of the transcript to the county in which the proceedings were held. If an intergovernmental agreement by the counties has required an evaluation in a county other than that of the afflicted person's residence, this expense may be charged to the county of the afflicted person's residence or in which the afflicted person was found before the evaluation.

#### Section 36-728. Judicial action

A. If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that a person is an afflicted person and presents a substantial danger to another person or to the community, the court shall order the afflicted person to do any one or more of the following pursuant to a written treatment plan developed or submitted by the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer and approved by the court:

1. Participate in a designated education program.

The terms prescribed by the court may incorporate the terms of a voluntary treatment plan that shall include provisions for the medically successful complete course of antituberculosis treatment.

C. The court shall order the least restrictive measures that are necessary for the examination, treatment, monitoring, isolation or quarantine of the afflicted person and that will effectively protect the public health and provide appropriate care for the afflicted person. In ordering the least restrictive measures necessary, the court shall also consider input from an afflicted person's parent or guardian, if the afflicted person is a minor or incapacitated person.

D. If the court enters an order pursuant to this section it shall designate a facility or program to supervise the afflicted person and administer the court's order.

F. The person, facility or program assigned to supervise the afflicted person pursuant to the court's order issued pursuant to this section shall be notified at least three days before a referral. The petitioner, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer recommending the referral and the person, institution or program shall share relevant information about the afflicted person to promote the health and safety of the public and to provide effective intervention and continuity of treatment.

G. On a motion by the director of the afflicted person's assigned institution or program or on a motion by the petitioner, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer, the court after a hearing may amend or alter its original order if it determines that any of the following is true:

1. The afflicted person is not complying with the terms of its original order.

2. The designated treatment plan is no longer appropriate.

3. Further observation, examination, treatment, isolation or quarantine is required.

H. If an afflicted person refuses to comply with any order or amended order issued pursuant to this section, the court may issue additional orders necessary to address and correct the afflicted person's noncompliance and may direct a sheriff or law enforcement officer, on the request of the tuberculosis control officer or local health officer, to take the afflicted person into custody and to oversee and ensure the transport of the person to a designated institution or program.  At the option of the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer, an afflicted person may be transported by a health care provider, emergency medical services personnel, a physician, ambulance personnel, an ambulance service, guardian, conservator, parent, custodian, relative or friend to a designated institution or facility.  A sheriff or law enforcement agency shall maintain custody of the afflicted person until the afflicted person is delivered to the institution or facility specified in the order or to an alternate institution or facility approved by the department, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer.

I. On issuance of an order or an amended order issued pursuant to this section, the afflicted person shall be informed of the right to appeal and the right to consult with an attorney.

K. The period of court ordered examination, monitoring, treatment, isolation or quarantine does not run during any unauthorized absence from the jurisdiction or from any required monitoring or supervision. The period resumes only on the afflicted person's voluntary or involuntary return to the designated facility or program.

L. Except as provided in this section, court ordered examination, treatment, monitoring, isolation or quarantine shall not exceed three hundred sixty-five days.

 

#### Section 36-729. Amended orders for intervention and transport of afflicted persons

A. If the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer determines that an afflicted person who is not currently detained is in need of immediate and acute intervention or care because the afflicted person's behavior is dangerous to another person or to the community, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer may issue a written or oral order to a sheriff or law enforcement officer that requires a health care provider, emergency medical services personnel, a physician, ambulance personnel, an ambulance service, guardian, conservator, parent, custodian, relative or friend to take the afflicted person to a location designated by the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer.  A sheriff or law enforcement agency shall maintain custody of the afflicted person until the afflicted person is delivered to the institution or facility specified in the order or to an alternate institution or facility approved by the department, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer.

B. If the court finds that the afflicted person needs an immediate guardian or conservator to protect the afflicted person or to carry out alternatives to court ordered examination, treatment, monitoring, isolation or quarantine and there is no person qualified and willing to act in that capacity, the court may appoint a person or the public fiduciary to serve as a temporary guardian or conservator.

#### Section 36-731. Confinement; selection; jails; prohibition

A. After an afflicted person has been taken into custody pursuant to this article, the tuberculosis control officer or local health officer is responsible for selecting a facility or quarters suitable for the comfortable, safe and humane confinement of the afflicted person, if the person is not otherwise admitted or confined in a health care institution. The tuberculosis control officer or local health officer may authorize a physician, health care provider, emergency medical services personnel, ambulance or ambulance service, guardian, conservator, parent, custodian, relative or friend to transport an afflicted person to a designated institution or facility if the tuberculosis control officer or local health officer determines that the means of transportation are reliable and would not be detrimental to any person's health, safety or welfare.  A sheriff or law enforcement agency shall maintain custody of the afflicted person until the afflicted person is delivered to the institution or facility specified in the order or to an alternate institution or facility approved by the department, the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer.

B. An afflicted person who is not incarcerated on a criminal charge and who is the subject of an order or petition under this article shall not be confined in any prison or jail where those charged with crimes are incarcerated unless the afflicted person represents an immediate and serious danger to the staff or physical facilities of a hospital or any institution to which committed, or unless the afflicted person has failed to obey a court order or has failed to obey a lawful order of the tuberculosis control officer or local health officer issued pursuant to this article and the medical director of the receiving facility or designee has determined that no less restrictive confinement measures are appropriate. The court shall subsequently determine the appropriate level of confinement necessary during this initial consideration of the petition and the request for compulsory detention pursuant to section 36-726, subsection F.

 

#### Section 36-732. Early release from court ordered treatment

A.

B. Notice of the discharge from the institution, facility or program shall be promptly given to the judge of the court that entered the court order. Without further court order the afflicted person may be released or discharged in accordance with the terms set forth in the treatment plan or court order.

On a finding of good cause the court may order a further hearing on a motion for early discharge or to amend or modify an existing court order pursuant to an affidavit of the petitioner or intervenor or the afflicted person or the afflicted person's attorney that states the need for further evidentiary hearing and the reasons the hearing is necessary before the time set for the release of the afflicted person.

#### Section 36-733. Choice of physician and mode of treatment

This article does not allow a private or public facility or agency to restrict an afflicted person's right to choose a physician or to select the mode of treatment within the terms determined by the tuberculosis control officer or the local health officer as available and necessary to protect the health and safety of another person or the community.

B. The department or local health authority may, during the state of emergency or state of war emergency declared by the governor, do the following:

1. Establish and maintain places of isolation and quarantine, which may include the residence of the person quarantined.

2. Require isolation or quarantine of any person by the least restrictive means necessary to protect the public health.  The department or local health authority shall use all reasonable means to prevent the transmission of disease among the isolated or quarantined persons.

D. A person subject to isolation or quarantine shall comply with the department's or local health authority's rules and orders, shall not go beyond the isolation or quarantine premises and shall not come in contact with any person not subject to isolation or quarantine other than a physician or other health care provider, department or local health authority or person authorized to enter an isolation or quarantine premises by the department or local health authority.

E. Other than a person authorized by the department or local health authority, a person shall not enter an isolation or quarantine premises.  If, by reason of an unauthorized entry into an isolation or quarantine premises, the person poses a danger to public health, the department, or local health authority may place the person in isolation or quarantine pursuant to this section or section 36-789.

#### Section 36-789. Due process for isolation and quarantine during a state of emergency or state of war emergency

A. The department, or local health authority may isolate or quarantine a person or group of persons through a written directive without first obtaining a written order from the court if any delay in the isolation or quarantine of the person would pose an immediate and serious threat to the public health.  The directive shall:

1. Specify the identity of the person or persons subject to isolation or quarantine, the premises subject to isolation or quarantine, the date and time at which isolation or quarantine commences, the suspected highly contagious and fatal disease, if known, and that a state of emergency has been declared by the governor.

2. Be given to the person or persons to be isolated or quarantined.  If the directive applies to groups of persons and it is impractical to provide individual copies, it may be posted in a conspicuous place in the isolation or quarantine premises.

B. Within ten days after issuing the written directive, or when any delay in the isolation or quarantine of a person or group of persons will not pose an immediate and serious threat to the public health, the department or local health authority shall file a petition for a court order authorizing the initial or continued isolation or quarantine of a person or group of persons.  The petition shall specify the following:

1. The identity of the person or group of persons subject to isolation or quarantine.

I. A person or group of persons isolated or quarantined pursuant to this section may apply to the court for an order to show cause why the person or group of persons should not be released.  The court must rule on the application to show cause within forty-eight hours after it is filed.  If the court grants the application, the court must schedule a hearing on the order to show cause within twenty-four hours after it issues the order to show cause.  The issuance of an order to show cause does not stay or enjoin an isolation or quarantine order.

J. A person isolated or quarantined pursuant to this section may request a court hearing regarding the person's treatment and the conditions of the quarantine or isolation.

K. On receiving a request for a hearing pursuant to subsection J of this section, the court must set a date for a hearing.  The hearing must take place within ten days after the court receives the request. The request for a hearing does not alter the order of isolation or quarantine. If the court finds that the isolation or quarantine of the person or group of persons does not comply with the requirements of this section or section 36-788, the court may provide remedies appropriate to the circumstances of the state of emergency, the rights of the individual and in keeping with the provisions of this article.

L. A record of the proceedings pursuant to this section shall be made and retained.  If, because of a state of emergency or state of war emergency declared pursuant to section 36-787, parties cannot personally appear before the court, the proceedings may be conducted by the authorized representatives of the parties and held by any means that allows all parties to fully participate.

M. The court shall appoint counsel at state expense to represent a person or group of persons who is subject to isolation or quarantine pursuant to this article and who is not otherwise represented by counsel. Representation by appointed counsel continues throughout the duration of the isolation or quarantine of the person or group of persons.  The department or local health authority must provide adequate means of communication between the isolated or quarantined persons and their counsel.

N. In any proceedings brought pursuant to this section, to promote the fair and efficient operation of justice and having given due regard to the rights of the affected persons, the protection of the public's health, the severity of the emergency and the availability of necessary witnesses and evidence, the court may order the consolidation of individual claims into groups of claims if:

1. The number of persons involved or to be affected is so large as to render individual participation impractical.

2. There are questions of law or fact common to the individual claims or rights to be determined.

3. The group claims or rights to be determined are typical of the affected person's claims or rights.

4. The entire group will be adequately represented in the consolidation.

#### Section 36-790. Privileges and immunities

E. A public agency which owns, operates, manages or contracts for rental housing accommodations may adopt reasonable regulations relating to pets including number of pets and neutering when appropriate and may impose conditions for the tenancy of elderly tenants or tenants with disabilities with pets different from those applicable to such tenants without pets, if these conditions are reasonably related to the presence of the pets.

Notwithstanding section 41-319, the notarized statement of parental consent and the description of the document or notarial act recorded in the notary journal are confidential and are not public records.

B. A judge of the superior court, on petition or motion, and after an appropriate hearing, shall authorize a physician to perform the abortion if the judge determines that the pregnant minor is mature and capable of giving informed consent to the proposed abortion.  If the judge determines that the pregnant minor is not mature or if the pregnant minor does not claim to be mature, the judge shall determine whether the performance of an abortion on her without the consent from one of her parents or her guardian or conservator would be in her best interests and shall authorize a physician to perform the abortion without consent if the judge concludes that the pregnant minor's best interests would be served.

C. If the pregnant minor claims to be mature at a proceeding held pursuant to subsection B of this section, the minor must prove by clear and convincing evidence that she is sufficiently mature and capable of giving informed consent without consulting her parent or legal guardian based on her experience level, perspective and judgment. In assessing the pregnant minor's experience level, the court may consider, among other relevant factors, the minor's age and experiences working outside the home, living away from home, traveling on her own, handling personal finances and making other significant decisions. In assessing the pregnant minor's perspective, the court may consider, among other relevant factors, what steps the minor took to explore her options and the extent to which she considered and weighed the potential consequences of each option. In assessing the pregnant minor's judgment, the court may consider, among other relevant factors, the minor's conduct since learning of her pregnancy and her intellectual ability to understand her options and to make an informed decision.

D. The pregnant minor may participate in the court proceedings on her own behalf.  The court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for her.  The court shall advise her that she has the right to court-appointed counsel and, on her request, shall provide her with counsel unless she appears through private counsel or she knowingly and intelligently waives her right to counsel.

E. Proceedings in the court under this section are confidential and have precedence over other pending matters.  Members of the public shall not inspect, obtain copies of or otherwise have access to records of court proceedings under this section unless authorized by law. A judge who conducts proceedings under this section shall make in writing specific factual findings and legal conclusions supporting the decision and shall order a confidential record of the evidence to be maintained, including the judge's own findings and conclusions.  The minor may file the petition using a fictitious name.  For the purposes of this subsection, public does not include judges, clerks, administrators, professionals or other persons employed by or working under the supervision of the court or employees of other public agencies who are authorized by state or federal rule or law to inspect and copy closed court records.

F. The court shall hold the hearing and shall issue a ruling within forty-eight hours, excluding weekends and holidays, after the petition is filed. If the court fails to issue a ruling within this time period, the petition is deemed to have been granted and the consent requirement is waived.

G. An expedited confidential appeal is available to a pregnant minor for whom the court denies an order authorizing an abortion without parental consent. The appellate court shall hold the hearing and issue a ruling within forty-eight hours, excluding weekends and holidays, after the petition for appellate review is filed.  Filing fees are not required of the pregnant minor at either the trial or the appellate level.

H. Parental consent or judicial authorization is not required under this section if either:

1. The pregnant minor certifies to the attending physician that the pregnancy resulted from sexual conduct with a minor by the minor's parent, stepparent, uncle, grandparent, sibling, adoptive parent, legal guardian or foster parent or by a person who lives in the same household with the minor and the minor's mother.  The physician performing the abortion shall report the sexual conduct with a minor to the proper law enforcement officials pursuant to section 13-3620 and shall preserve and forward a sample of the fetal tissue to these officials for use in a criminal investigation.

2. The attending physician certifies in the pregnant minor's medical record that, on the basis of the physician's good faith clinical judgment, the pregnant minor has a condition that so complicates her medical condition as to necessitate the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of major bodily function.

I. A person who performs an abortion in violation of this section is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.  A person who intentionally causes, aids or assists a minor in obtaining an abortion in violation of this section is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.  A person is not subject to any liability under this section if the person establishes by written evidence that the person relied on evidence sufficient to convince a careful and prudent person that the representations of the pregnant minor regarding information necessary to comply with this section are true.

J. In addition to other remedies available under the common or statutory law of this state, one or both of the minor's parents or the minor's guardian may bring a civil action in the superior court in the county in which the parents or the guardian resides to obtain appropriate relief for a violation of this section, unless the pregnancy resulted from the criminal conduct of the parent or guardian.  The civil action may be based on a claim that failure to obtain consent was a result of simple negligence, gross negligence, wantonness, wilfulness, intention or any other legal standard of care.  The civil action may be brought against the person who performs the abortion in violation of this section and any person who causes, aids or assists a minor to obtain an abortion without meeting the requirements of this section. Relief pursuant to this subsection includes the following:

1. Money damages for all psychological, emotional and physical injuries that result from the violation of this section.

2. Statutory damages in an amount equal to $5,000 or three times the cost of the abortion, whichever is greater.

3. Reasonable attorney fees and costs.

K. A civil action brought pursuant to this section must be initiated within six years after the violation occurred.

L. The consent required by this section must be obtained on a form prescribed by the department of health services.  At a minimum, the form must:

3. List the possible medical risks that may occur with a medication abortion, including hemorrhage, infection, failure to remove the unborn child that may result in an additional procedure, sterility and the possible continuation of the pregnancy.

4. Require the pregnant minor's and the pregnant minor's parent's initials on each page of the form and a full signature on the final page of the form.

5. Include a space for the notary's signature and seal on the final page of the form.

M. The physician must maintain the form in the pregnant minor's records for seven years after the date of the procedure or five years after the date of the minor's maturity, whichever is longer.

#### Section 36-2523. Records of registrants; inspection; confidentiality

A. Persons registered to manufacture, distribute or dispense controlled substances under this chapter shall keep records and maintain inventories in conformance with the record keeping and inventory requirements of federal law and title 32, chapter 18, and with any additional rules the board issues.  Prescription orders must be filed as required by section 36-2525.

B. A person who holds a permit to operate a pharmacy issued under title 32, chapter 18 shall inventory schedule II, III, IV and V controlled substances as prescribed by federal law. The permit holder shall conduct this inventory on May 1 of each year or as directed by the Arizona state board of pharmacy.  The permit holder shall also conduct this inventory if there is a change of ownership or discontinuance of business or within ten days of a change of a pharmacist in charge.

C. These records and inventories shall be open for inspection by peace officers in the performance of their duties.  An officer shall not divulge information obtained pursuant to this subsection except in connection with a prosecution, investigation, judicial proceeding or administrative proceeding in which the person to whom the information relates is a party.

 

#### Section 36-2524. Order forms

Controlled substances in schedules I and II shall be distributed by a registrant to another registrant only pursuant to an order form.  Compliance with the provisions of federal law respecting order forms shall be deemed compliance with this section.

#### Section 36-2525. Prescription orders; labels; packaging; definition

A. In addition to the requirements of section 32-1968 pertaining to prescription orders for prescription-only drugs, the prescription order for a controlled substance shall bear the name, address and federal registration number of the prescriber. A prescription order for a schedule II controlled substance drug other than a hospital drug order for a hospital inpatient shall contain only one drug order per prescription blank. If authorized verbally by the prescriber, the pharmacist may make changes to a written or electronic schedule II controlled substance prescription order, except for any of the following:

1. The patient's name.

2. The prescriber's name.

3. The drug name.

B. The pharmacist must document on the original prescription order the changes that were made pursuant to the verbal authorization and record the time and date the authorization was granted.

C. A person who is registered to dispense controlled substances under this chapter must keep and maintain prescription orders for controlled substances as follows:

1. Prescription orders for controlled substances listed in schedules I and II must be maintained in a separate prescription file for controlled substances listed in schedules I and II only.

2. Prescription orders for controlled substances listed in schedules III, IV and V must be maintained either in a separate prescription file for controlled substances listed in schedules III, IV and V only or in a form that allows them to be readily retrievable from the other prescription records of the registrant. For the purposes of this paragraph, "readily retrievable" means that, when the prescription is initially filed, the face of the prescription is stamped in red ink in the lower right corner with the letter "C" in a font that is not less than one inch high and that the prescription is filed in the usual consecutively numbered prescription file for noncontrolled substance prescriptions.  The requirement to stamp the hard copy prescription with a red "C" is waived if a registrant employs an electronic data processing system or other electronic recordkeeping system for prescriptions that permits identification by prescription number and retrieval of original documents by the prescriber's name, patient's name, drug dispensed and date filled.

D. Except in emergency situations in conformity with subsection E of this section, under the conditions specified in subsections F and G of this section or when dispensed directly by a medical practitioner to an ultimate user, a controlled substance in schedule II shall not be dispensed without either the written prescription order in ink or indelible pencil or typewritten and manually signed by the medical practitioner or an electronic prescription order as prescribed by federal law or regulation.  Beginning January 1, 2020, a schedule II controlled substance that is an opioid may be dispensed only with an electronic prescription order as prescribed by federal law or regulation. A prescription order for a schedule II controlled substance shall not be dispensed more than ninety days after the date on which the prescription order was issued.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a pharmacy may sell and dispense a schedule II controlled substance prescribed by a medical practitioner who is located in another state if the prescription was issued to the patient according to and in compliance with the applicable laws of the state of the prescribing medical practitioner and federal law. A prescription order for a schedule II controlled substance shall not be refilled.  A pharmacist is not in violation of this subsection and may dispense a prescription order in the following circumstances:

1. During any time period in which an established electronic prescribing system or a pharmacy management system is not operational or available in a timely manner.  If the electronic prescribing system or a pharmacy management system is not operational or available, the pharmacist may dispense a prescription order that is written for a schedule II controlled substance that is an opioid.  The pharmacist must maintain a record, for a period of time prescribed by the board, of when the electronic prescribing system or pharmacy management system is not operational or available in a timely manner.

2. The prescription order for a schedule II controlled substance that is an opioid is in writing and indicates that the medical practitioner who issued the prescription order provided care for the patient in a veterans administration facility, a health facility on a military base, an Indian health services hospital or other Indian health service facility, or a tribal-owned clinic.

E. In emergency situations, emergency quantities of schedule II controlled substances may be dispensed on an oral prescription order of a medical practitioner. Such an emergency prescription order shall be immediately reduced to writing by the pharmacist and shall contain all the information required for schedule II controlled substances except for the manual signing of the order by the medical practitioner.  Within seven days after authorizing an emergency oral prescription order, the prescribing medical practitioner shall cause a written prescription order manually signed for the emergency quantity prescribed to be delivered to the dispensing pharmacist or an electronic prescription order to be transmitted to the dispensing pharmacist. In addition to conforming to other requirements for prescription orders for schedule II controlled substances, the prescription order shall indicate electronically or have written on its face "authorization for emergency dispensing" and the date of the oral order. If the prescribing medical practitioner fails to deliver such an emergency prescription order within seven days in conformance with board rules, the pharmacist shall notify the board.  Failure of the pharmacist to notify the board voids the authority conferred by this subsection to dispense without a prescription order of a medical practitioner that is electronic or that is written and manually signed.

F. Notwithstanding subsections D and N of this section, a patient's medical practitioner or the medical practitioner's agent may transmit to a pharmacy by fax a prescription order written for a schedule II controlled substance, including opioids, if the prescription order is any of the following:

1. To be compounded for the direct administration to a patient by parenteral, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous or intraspinal infusion.

2. For a resident of a long-term care facility.

3. For a patient who is enrolled in a hospice care program that is certified or paid for by medicare under title XVIII or a hospice program that is licensed by this state. The medical practitioner or the medical practitioner's agent must note on the prescription that the patient is a hospice patient.

G. A fax transmitted pursuant to subsection F of this section is the original written prescription order for purposes of this section and must be maintained as required by subsection C of this section.

H. Except when dispensed directly by a medical practitioner to an ultimate user, a controlled substance included in schedule III or IV that requires a prescription order as determined under state or federal laws shall not be dispensed without a written or oral prescription order of a medical practitioner or an electronic prescription order as prescribed by federal law or regulation. The prescription order shall not be filled or refilled more than six months after the date on which the prescription order was issued.  A prescription order authorized to be refilled shall not be refilled more than five times.  Additional quantities may only be authorized by the prescribing medical practitioner through issuance of a new prescription order that shall be treated by the pharmacist as a new and separate prescription order.

I. Except when dispensed directly by a medical practitioner to an ultimate user, a controlled substance that is included in schedule V and that requires a prescription order as determined under state or federal laws shall not be dispensed without a written or oral prescription order of a medical practitioner. The prescription order may be refilled as authorized by the prescribing medical practitioner but shall not be filled or refilled more than one year after the date of issuance.

J. A controlled substance that is listed in schedule III, IV or V and that does not require a prescription order as determined under state or federal laws may be dispensed at retail by a pharmacist or a pharmacy intern under the pharmacist's supervision without a prescription order to a purchaser who is at least eighteen years of age if all of the following are true:

1. It is for a legitimate medical purpose.

2. Not more than two hundred forty cubic centimeters (eight ounces) of any such controlled substance containing opium, nor more than one hundred twenty cubic centimeters (four ounces) of any other such controlled substance, nor more than forty-eight dosage units of any such controlled substance containing opium, nor more than twenty-four dosage units of any other controlled substance may be dispensed at retail to the same purchaser in any given forty-eight-hour period.

3. No more than one hundred dosage units of any single active ingredient ephedrine preparation may be sold, offered for sale, bartered or given away to any one person in any one thirty-day period.

4. The pharmacist or pharmacy intern requires every purchaser of a controlled substance under this subsection who is not known to that person to furnish suitable identification, including proof of age if appropriate.

5. A bound record book for dispensing controlled substances under this subsection is maintained by the pharmacist and contains the name and address of the purchaser, the name and quantity of the controlled substance purchased, the date of each purchase and the name or initials of the pharmacist or pharmacy intern who dispensed the substance to the purchaser. The book shall be maintained in conformity with the recordkeeping requirements of section 36-2523.

K. In the absence of a law requiring a prescription for a schedule V controlled substance, the board, by rules, may require, or remove the requirement of, a prescription order for a schedule V controlled substance.

L. The label on a container of a controlled substance that is directly dispensed by a medical practitioner or pharmacist and that is not for the immediate administration to the ultimate user, such as a bed patient in a hospital, shall bear the name and address of the dispensing medical practitioner or pharmacist, the serial number, the date of dispensing, the name of the prescriber, the name of the patient or, if an animal, the name of the owner of the animal and the species of the animal, the directions for use and cautionary statements, if any, contained in the prescription order or required by law.  If the controlled substance is included in schedule II, III or IV, the label shall bear a transfer warning to the effect: "Caution: federal law prohibits the transfer of this drug to any person other than the patient for whom it was prescribed".  The container of a schedule II controlled substance that is an opioid that is directly dispensed by a pharmacist and that is not for the immediate administration to the ultimate user shall have a red cap and a warning label prescribed by the board about potential addiction.  The board or the executive director, if delegated by the board, may waive the red cap requirement if implementing the requirement is not feasible because of the specific dosage form or packaging type.

M. Controlled substances in schedules II, III, IV and V may be dispensed as electronically transmitted prescriptions if the prescribing medical practitioner is all of the following:

1. Properly registered by the United States drug enforcement administration.

2. Licensed in good standing in the United States jurisdiction in which the medical practitioner practices.

3. Authorized to issue such prescriptions in the jurisdiction in which the medical practitioner is licensed.

N. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, beginning January 1, 2020, each prescription order, except a prescription order under subsection F of this section, that is issued by a medical practitioner for a schedule II controlled substance that is an opioid shall be transmitted electronically to the dispensing pharmacy.  A medical practitioner is not in violation of this subsection:

1. During any time in which an established electronic prescribing system or a pharmacy management system is not operational or available in a timely manner. If the electronic prescribing system or a pharmacy management system is not operational or available, the medical practitioner may write a prescription order for a schedule II controlled substance that is an opioid. The medical practitioner shall indicate on the written prescription order that the electronic prescribing system or pharmacy management system is not operational or available. The medical practitioner must maintain a record, for a period of time prescribed by the board, of when the electronic prescribing system or pharmacy management system is not operational or available in a timely manner.

2. If the medical practitioner writes a prescription order for a schedule II controlled substance that is an opioid that will be dispensed for the patient from a veterans administration facility, a health facility on a military base, an Indian health services hospital or other Indian health service facility, or a tribal-owned clinic.

O. The requirement in subsections D and N of this section for an electronic prescription order does not apply to a prescription order for a schedule II controlled substance that is an opioid that is issued for medication-assisted treatment for a substance use disorder.

P. The board, by rule, may provide additional requirements for prescribing and dispensing controlled substances.

Q. In consultation with the task force established pursuant to section 36-2603, the board may prescribe by rule additional exceptions to the electronic prescribing requirements specified in this section for both pharmacists and medical practitioners.

R. Notwithstanding subsections D and N of this section, a medical practitioner who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 21 is not required to comply with the electronic prescribing requirements of subsections D and N of this section until the Arizona state veterinary medical examining board determines that electronic prescribing software is widely available for veterinarians and notifies the Arizona state board of pharmacy of that determination.

S. For the purposes of this section, "medication-assisted treatment" has the same meaning prescribed in section 32-3201.01.

(a) Is in possession of a registry identification card.

(b) Is in possession of an amount of marijuana that does not exceed the allowable amount of marijuana.

2. The presumption may be rebutted by evidence that conduct related to marijuana was not for the purpose of treating or alleviating the qualifying patient's debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the qualifying patient's debilitating medical condition pursuant to this chapter.

B. A registered qualifying patient or registered designated caregiver is not subject to arrest, prosecution or penalty in any manner, or denial of any right or privilege, including any civil penalty or disciplinary action by a court or occupational or professional licensing board or bureau:

1. For the registered qualifying patient's medical use of marijuana pursuant to this chapter, if the registered qualifying patient does not possess more than the allowable amount of marijuana.

2. For the registered designated caregiver assisting a registered qualifying patient to whom he is connected through the department's registration process with the registered qualifying patient's medical use of marijuana pursuant to this chapter if the registered designated caregiver does not possess more than the allowable amount of marijuana.

3. For offering or providing marijuana to a registered qualifying patient or a registered designated caregiver for the registered qualifying patient's medical use or to a registered nonprofit medical marijuana dispensary if nothing of value is transferred in return and the person giving the marijuana does not knowingly cause the recipient to possess more than the allowable amount of marijuana.

C. A physician shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution or penalty in any manner or denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to civil penalty or disciplinary action by the Arizona board of medical examiners or by any other business, occupational or professional licensing board or bureau, based solely on providing written certifications or for otherwise stating that, in the physician's professional opinion, a patient is likely to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marijuana to treat or alleviate the patient's debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition, but nothing in this chapter prevents a professional licensing board from sanctioning a physician for failing to properly evaluate a patient's medical condition or otherwise violating the standard of care for evaluating medical conditions.

D. No person may be subject to arrest, prosecution or penalty in any manner, or denied any right or privilege, including any civil penalty or disciplinary action by a court or occupational or professional licensing board or bureau, for:

G. Property, including all interests in the property, otherwise subject to forfeiture under title 13, chapter 39, that is possessed, owned or used in connection with the medical use of marijuana authorized under this chapter or acts incidental to the medical use of marijuana authorized under this chapter, is not subject to seizure or forfeiture.  This subsection does not prevent civil forfeiture if the basis for the forfeiture is unrelated to the medical use of marijuana.

H. Mere possession of, or application for, a registry identification card may not constitute probable cause or reasonable suspicion, nor may it be used to support the search of the person or property of the person possessing or applying for the registry identification card.  The possession of, or application for, a registry identification card does not preclude the existence of probable cause if probable cause exists on other grounds.

I. No school, landlord or employer may be penalized or denied any benefit under state law for enrolling, leasing to or employing a registered qualifying patient or a registered designated caregiver.

1. The person's status as a cardholder.

2. A registered qualifying patient's positive drug test for marijuana components or metabolites, unless the patient used, possessed or was impaired by marijuana on the premises of the place of employment or during the hours of employment.

C.

#### Section 36-2903. Arizona health care cost containment system; administrator; powers and duties of director and administrator; exemption from attorney general representation; definition

A. The Arizona health care cost containment system is established consisting of contracts with contractors for the provision of hospitalization and medical care coverage to members. Except as specifically required by federal law and by section 36-2909, the system is only responsible for providing care on or after the date that the person has been determined eligible for the system, and is only responsible for reimbursing the cost of care rendered on or after the date that the person was determined eligible for the system.

B. An agreement may be entered into with an independent contractor, subject to title 41, chapter 23, to serve as the statewide administrator of the system. The administrator has full operational responsibility, subject to supervision by the director, for the system, which may include any or all of the following:

4. Development of a complete system of accounts and controls for the system including provisions designed to ensure that covered health and medical services provided through the system are not used unnecessarily or unreasonably including but not limited to inpatient behavioral health services provided in a hospital. Periodically the administrator shall compare the scope, utilization rates, utilization control methods and unit prices of major health and medical services provided in this state in comparison with other states' health care services to identify any unnecessary or unreasonable utilization within the system.  The administrator shall periodically assess the cost effectiveness and health implications of alternate approaches to the provision of covered health and medical services through the system in order to reduce unnecessary or unreasonable utilization.

11. Development of a health education and information program.

12. Development and management of an enrollment system.

13. Establishment and maintenance of a claims resolution procedure to ensure that ninety per cent of the clean claims shall be paid within thirty days of receipt and ninety-nine per cent of the remaining clean claims shall be paid within ninety days of receipt. For the purposes of this paragraph, "clean claims" has the same meaning prescribed in section 36-2904, subsection G.

14. Establishment of standards for the coordination of medical care and patient transfers pursuant to section 36-2909, subsection B.

15. Establishment of a system to implement medical child support requirements, as required by federal law.  The administration may enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the department of economic security to implement this paragraph.

16. Establishment of an employee recognition fund.

17. Establishment of an eligibility process to determine whether a medicare low income subsidy is available to persons who want to apply for a subsidy as authorized by title XVIII.

C. If an agreement is not entered into with an independent contractor to serve as statewide administrator of the system pursuant to subsection B of this section, the director shall ensure that the operational responsibilities set forth in subsection B of this section are fulfilled by the administration and other contractors as necessary.

D. If the director determines that the administrator will fulfill some but not all of the responsibilities set forth in subsection B of this section, the director shall ensure that the remaining responsibilities are fulfilled by the administration and other contractors as necessary.

E. The administrator or any direct or indirect subsidiary of the administrator is not eligible to serve as a contractor.

F. Except for reinsurance obtained by contractors, the administrator shall coordinate benefits provided under this article to any eligible person who is covered by workers' compensation, disability insurance, a hospital and medical service corporation, a health care services organization, an accountable health plan or any other health or medical or disability insurance plan including coverage made available to persons defined as eligible by section 36-2901, paragraph 6, subdivisions (b), (c), (d) and (e), or who receives payments for accident-related injuries, so that any costs for hospitalization and medical care paid by the system are recovered from any other available third party payors. The administrator may require that contractors and noncontracting providers are responsible for the coordination of benefits for services provided under this article.  Requirements for coordination of benefits by noncontracting providers under this section are limited to coordination with standard health insurance and disability insurance policies and similar programs for health coverage. The system shall act as payor of last resort for persons eligible pursuant to section 36-2901, paragraph 6, subdivision (a), section 36-2974 or section 36-2981, paragraph 6 unless specifically prohibited by federal law.  By operation of law, eligible persons assign to the system and a county rights to all types of medical benefits to which the person is entitled, including first party medical benefits under automobile insurance policies based on the order of priorities established pursuant to section 36-2915. The state has a right to subrogation against any other person or firm to enforce the assignment of medical benefits. The provisions of this subsection are controlling over the provisions of any insurance policy that provides benefits to an eligible person if the policy is inconsistent with the provisions of this subsection.

G. Notwithstanding subsection E of this section, the administrator may subcontract distinct administrative functions to one or more persons who may be contractors within the system.

H. The director shall require as a condition of a contract with any contractor that all records relating to contract compliance are available for inspection by the administrator and the director subject to subsection I of this section and that such records be maintained by the contractor for five years.  The director shall also require that these records be made available by a contractor on request of the secretary of the United States department of health and human services, or its successor agency.

I. Subject to existing law relating to privilege and protection, the director shall prescribe by rule the types of information that are confidential and circumstances under which such information may be used or released, including requirements for physician-patient confidentiality.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, such rules shall be designed to provide for the exchange of necessary information among the counties, the administration and the department of economic security for the purposes of eligibility determination under this article.  Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a member's medical record shall be released without the member's consent in situations or suspected cases of fraud or abuse relating to the system to an officer of the state's certified Arizona health care cost containment system fraud control unit who has submitted a written request for the medical record.

J. The director shall prescribe rules that specify methods for:

1. The transition of members between system contractors and noncontracting providers.

2. The transfer of members and persons who have been determined eligible from hospitals that do not have contracts to care for such persons.

K. The director shall adopt rules that set forth procedures and standards for use by the system in requesting county long-term care for members or persons determined eligible.

L. To the extent that services are furnished pursuant to this article, and unless otherwise required pursuant to this chapter, a contractor is not subject to title 20.

M. As a condition of the contract with any contractor, the director shall require contract terms as necessary in the judgment of the director to ensure adequate performance and compliance with all applicable federal laws by the contractor of the provisions of each contract executed pursuant to this chapter.  Contract provisions required by the director shall include at a minimum the maintenance of deposits, performance bonds, financial reserves or other financial security.  The director may waive requirements for the posting of bonds or security for contractors that have posted other security, equal to or greater than that required by the system, with a state agency for the performance of health service contracts if funds would be available from such security for the system on default by the contractor.  The director may also adopt rules for the withholding or forfeiture of payments to be made to a contractor by the system for the failure of the contractor to comply with a provision of the contractor's contract with the system or with the adopted rules. The director may also require contract terms allowing the administration to operate a contractor directly under circumstances specified in the contract. The administration shall operate the contractor only as long as it is necessary to assure delivery of uninterrupted care to members enrolled with the contractor and accomplish the orderly transition of those members to other system contractors, or until the contractor reorganizes or otherwise corrects the contract performance failure. The administration shall not operate a contractor unless, before that action, the administration delivers notice to the contractor and provides an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with procedures established by the director.  Notwithstanding the provisions of a contract, if the administration finds that the public health, safety or welfare requires emergency action, it may operate as the contractor on notice to the contractor and pending an administrative hearing, which it shall promptly institute.

N. The administration for the sole purpose of matters concerning and directly related to the Arizona health care cost containment system and the Arizona long-term care system is exempt from section 41-192.

O. Notwithstanding subsection F of this section, if the administration determines that according to federal guidelines it is more cost-effective for a person defined as eligible under section 36-2901, paragraph 6, subdivision (a) to be enrolled in a group health insurance plan in which the person is entitled to be enrolled, the administration may pay all of that person's premiums, deductibles, coinsurance and other cost sharing obligations for services covered under section 36-2907. The person shall apply for enrollment in the group health insurance plan as a condition of eligibility under section 36-2901, paragraph 6, subdivision (a).

P. The total amount of state monies that may be spent in any fiscal year by the administration for health care shall not exceed the amount appropriated or authorized by section 35-173 for all health care purposes. This article does not impose a duty on an officer, agent or employee of this state to discharge a responsibility or to create any right in a person or group if the discharge or right would require an expenditure of state monies in excess of the expenditure authorized by legislative appropriation for that specific purpose.

Q. Notwithstanding section 36-470, a contractor or program contractor may receive laboratory tests from a laboratory or hospital-based laboratory for a system member enrolled with the contractor or program contractor subject to all of the following requirements:

1. The contractor or program contractor shall provide a written request to the laboratory in a format mutually agreed to by the laboratory and the requesting health plan or program contractor. The request shall include the member's name, the member's plan identification number, the specific test results that are being requested and the time periods and the quality improvement activity that prompted the request.

2. The laboratory data may be provided in written or electronic format based on the agreement between the laboratory and the contractor or program contractor. If there is no contract between the laboratory and the contractor or program contractor, the laboratory shall provide the requested data in a format agreed to by the noncontracted laboratory.

3. The laboratory test results provided to the member's contractor or program contractor shall only be used for quality improvement activities authorized by the administration and health care outcome studies required by the administration.  The contractors and program contractors shall maintain strict confidentiality about the test results and identity of the member as specified in contractual arrangements with the administration and pursuant to state and federal law.

4. The administration, after collaboration with the department of health services regarding quality improvement activities, may prohibit the contractors and program contractors from receiving certain test results if the administration determines that a serious potential exists that the results may be used for purposes other than those intended for the quality improvement activities.  The department of health services shall consult with the clinical laboratory licensure advisory committee established by section 36-465 before providing recommendations to the administration on certain test results and quality improvement activities.

5. The administration shall provide contracted laboratories and the department of health services with an annual report listing the quality improvement activities that will require laboratory data.  The report shall be updated and distributed to the contracting laboratories and the department of health services when laboratory data is needed for new quality improvement activities.

6. A laboratory that complies with a request from the contractor or program contractor for laboratory results pursuant to this section is not subject to civil liability for providing the data to the contractor or program contractor. The administration, the contractor or a program contractor that uses data for reasons other than quality improvement activities is subject to civil liability for this improper use.

R. For the purposes of this section, "quality improvement activities" means those requirements, including health care outcome studies specified in federal law or required by the centers for medicare and medicaid services or the administration, to improve health care outcomes.

 

#### Section 36-2903.01. Additional powers and duties; report; definition

A. The director of the Arizona health care cost containment system administration may adopt rules that provide that the system may withhold or forfeit payments to be made to a noncontracting provider by the system if the noncontracting provider fails to comply with this article, the provider agreement or rules that are adopted pursuant to this article and that relate to the specific services rendered for which a claim for payment is made.

B. The director shall:

1. Prescribe uniform forms to be used by all contractors.  The rules shall require a written and signed application by the applicant or an applicant's authorized representative, or, if the person is incompetent or incapacitated, a family member or a person acting responsibly for the applicant may obtain a signature or a reasonable facsimile and file the application as prescribed by the administration.

2. Enter into an interagency agreement with the department to establish a streamlined eligibility process to determine the eligibility of all persons defined pursuant to section 36-2901, paragraph 6, subdivision (a).  At the administration's option, the interagency agreement may allow the administration to determine the eligibility of certain persons, including those defined pursuant to section 36-2901, paragraph 6, subdivision (a).

3. Enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the department to:

(a) Establish an expedited eligibility and enrollment process for all persons who are hospitalized at the time of application.

(b) Establish performance measures and incentives for the department.

(c) Establish the process for management evaluation reviews that the administration shall perform to evaluate the eligibility determination functions performed by the department.

(d) Establish eligibility quality control reviews by the administration.

(g) Withhold payments based on the allowable sanctions for errors in eligibility determinations or redeterminations or failure to meet performance measures required by the intergovernmental agreement.

(h) Recoup from the department all federal fiscal sanctions that result from the department's inaccurate eligibility determinations.  The director may offset all or part of a sanction if the department submits a corrective action plan and a strategy to remedy the error.

4. By rule establish a procedure and time frames for the intake of grievances and requests for hearings, for the continuation of benefits and services during the appeal process and for a grievance process at the contractor level. Notwithstanding sections 41-1092.02, 41-1092.03 and 41-1092.05, the administration shall develop rules to establish the procedure and time frame for the informal resolution of grievances and appeals. A grievance that is not related to a claim for payment of system covered services shall be filed in writing with and received by the administration or the prepaid capitated provider or program contractor not later than sixty days after the date of the adverse action, decision or policy implementation being grieved.  A grievance that is related to a claim for payment of system covered services must be filed in writing and received by the administration or the prepaid capitated provider or program contractor within twelve months after the date of service, within twelve months after the date that eligibility is posted or within sixty days after the date of the denial of a timely claim submission, whichever is later.  A grievance for the denial of a claim for reimbursement of services may contest the validity of any adverse action, decision, policy implementation or rule that related to or resulted in the full or partial denial of the claim.  A policy implementation may be subject to a grievance procedure, but it may not be appealed for a hearing. The administration is not required to participate in a mandatory settlement conference if it is not a real party in interest. In any proceeding before the administration, including a grievance or hearing, persons may represent themselves or be represented by a duly authorized agent who is not charging a fee. A legal entity may be represented by an officer, partner or employee who is specifically authorized by the legal entity to represent it in the particular proceeding.

5. Apply for and accept federal funds available under title XIX of the social security act (P.L. 89-97; 79 Stat. 344; 42 United States Code section 1396 (1980)) in support of the system. The application made by the director pursuant to this paragraph shall be designed to qualify for federal funding primarily on a prepaid capitated basis.  Such funds may be used only for the support of persons defined as eligible pursuant to title XIX of the social security act or the approved section 1115 waiver.

6. At least thirty days before the implementation of a policy or a change to an existing policy relating to reimbursement, provide notice to interested parties.  Parties interested in receiving notification of policy changes shall submit a written request for notification to the administration.

7. In addition to the cost sharing requirements specified in subsection D, paragraph 4 of this section:

(a) Charge monthly premiums up to the maximum amount allowed by federal law to all populations of eligible persons who may be charged.

(b) Implement this paragraph to the extent permitted under the federal deficit reduction act of 2005 and other federal laws, subject to the approval of federal waiver authority and to the extent that any changes in the cost sharing requirements under this paragraph would permit this state to receive any enhanced federal matching rate.

C. The director is authorized to apply for any federal funds available for the support of programs to investigate and prosecute violations arising from the administration and operation of the system. Available state funds appropriated for the administration and operation of the system may be used as matching funds to secure federal funds pursuant to this subsection.

D. The director may adopt rules or procedures to do the following:

1. Authorize advance payments based on estimated liability to a contractor or a noncontracting provider after the contractor or noncontracting provider has submitted a claim for services and before the claim is ultimately resolved. The rules shall specify that any advance payment shall be conditioned on the execution before payment of a contract with the contractor or noncontracting provider that requires the administration to retain a specified percentage, which shall be at least twenty percent, of the claimed amount as security and that requires repayment to the administration if the administration makes any overpayment.

2. Defer liability, in whole or in part, of contractors for care provided to members who are hospitalized on the date of enrollment or under other circumstances. Payment shall be on a capped fee-for-service basis for services other than hospital services and at the rate established pursuant to subsection G of this section for hospital services or at the rate paid by the health plan, whichever is less.

3. Deputize, in writing, any qualified officer or employee in the administration to perform any act that the director by law is empowered to do or charged with the responsibility of doing, including the authority to issue final administrative decisions pursuant to section 41-1092.08.

4. Notwithstanding any other law, require persons eligible pursuant to section 36-2901, paragraph 6, subdivision (a), section 36-2931 and section 36-2981, paragraph 6 to be financially responsible for any cost sharing requirements established in a state plan or a section 1115 waiver and approved by the centers for medicare and medicaid services.  Cost sharing requirements may include copayments, coinsurance, deductibles, enrollment fees and monthly premiums for enrolled members, including households with children enrolled in the Arizona long-term care system.

E. The director shall adopt rules that further specify the medical care and hospital services that are covered by the system pursuant to section 36-2907.

F. In addition to the rules otherwise specified in this article, the director may adopt necessary rules pursuant to title 41, chapter 6 to carry out this article.  Rules adopted by the director pursuant to this subsection shall consider the differences between rural and urban conditions on the delivery of hospitalization and medical care.

G. For inpatient hospital admissions and outpatient hospital services on and after March 1, 1993, the administration shall adopt rules for the reimbursement of hospitals according to the following procedures:

1. For inpatient hospital stays from March 1, 1993 through September 30, 2014, the administration shall use a prospective tiered per diem methodology, using hospital peer groups if analysis shows that cost differences can be attributed to independently definable features that hospitals within a peer group share. In peer grouping the administration may consider such factors as length of stay differences and labor market variations. If there are no cost differences, the administration shall implement a stop loss-stop gain or similar mechanism.  Any stop loss-stop gain or similar mechanism shall ensure that the tiered per diem rates assigned to a hospital do not represent less than ninety percent of its 1990 base year costs or more than one hundred ten percent of its 1990 base year costs, adjusted by an audit factor, during the period of March 1, 1993 through September 30, 1994. The tiered per diem rates set for hospitals shall represent no less than eighty-seven and one-half percent or more than one hundred twelve and one-half percent of its 1990 base year costs, adjusted by an audit factor, from October 1, 1994 through September 30, 1995 and no less than eighty-five percent or more than one hundred fifteen percent of its 1990 base year costs, adjusted by an audit factor, from October 1, 1995 through September 30, 1996. For the periods after September 30, 1996 no stop loss-stop gain or similar mechanisms shall be in effect. An adjustment in the stop loss-stop gain percentage may be made to ensure that total payments do not increase as a result of this provision. If peer groups are used, the administration shall establish initial peer group designations for each hospital before implementation of the per diem system. The administration may also use a negotiated rate methodology. The tiered per diem methodology may include separate consideration for specialty hospitals that limit their provision of services to specific patient populations, such as rehabilitative patients or children. The initial per diem rates shall be based on hospital claims and encounter data for dates of service November 1, 1990 through October 31, 1991 and processed through May of 1992. The administration may also establish a separate reimbursement methodology for claims with extraordinarily high costs per day that exceed thresholds established by the administration.

2. For rates effective on October 1, 1994, and annually through September 30, 2011, the administration shall adjust tiered per diem payments for inpatient hospital care by the data resources incorporated market basket index for prospective payment system hospitals. For rates effective beginning on October 1, 1999, the administration shall adjust payments to reflect changes in length of stay for the maternity and nursery tiers.

3. Through June 30, 2004, for outpatient hospital services, the administration shall reimburse a hospital by applying a hospital specific outpatient cost-to-charge ratio to the covered charges. Beginning on July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005, the administration shall reimburse a hospital by applying a hospital specific outpatient cost-to-charge ratio to covered charges.  If the hospital increases its charges for outpatient services filed with the Arizona department of health services pursuant to chapter 4, article 3 of this title, by more than 4.7 percent for dates of service effective on or after July 1, 2004, the hospital specific cost-to-charge ratio will be reduced by the amount that it exceeds 4.7 percent.  If charges exceed 4.7 percent, the effective date of the increased charges will be the effective date of the adjusted Arizona health care cost containment system cost-to-charge ratio.  The administration shall develop the methodology for a capped fee-for-service schedule and a statewide cost-to-charge ratio. Any covered outpatient service not included in the capped fee-for-service schedule shall be reimbursed by applying the statewide cost-to-charge ratio that is based on the services not included in the capped fee-for-service schedule. Beginning on July 1, 2005, the administration shall reimburse clean claims with dates of service on or after July 1, 2005, based on the capped fee-for-service schedule or the statewide cost-to-charge ratio established pursuant to this paragraph. The administration may make additional adjustments to the outpatient hospital rates established pursuant to this section based on other factors, including the number of beds in the hospital, specialty services available to patients and the geographic location of the hospital.

4. Except if submitted under an electronic claims submission system, a hospital bill is considered received for purposes of this paragraph on initial receipt of the legible, error-free claim form by the administration if the claim includes the following error-free documentation in legible form:

(a) An admission face sheet.

(b) An itemized statement.

(c) An admission history and physical.

(d) A discharge summary or an interim summary if the claim is split.

(e) An emergency record, if admission was through the emergency room.

(f) Operative reports, if applicable.

(g) A labor and delivery room report, if applicable.

Payment received by a hospital from the administration pursuant to this subsection or from a contractor either by contract or pursuant to section 36-2904, subsection I is considered payment by the administration or the contractor of the administration's or contractor's liability for the hospital bill. A hospital may collect any unpaid portion of its bill from other third-party payors or in situations covered by title 33, chapter 7, article 3.

5. For services rendered on and after October 1, 1997, the administration shall pay a hospital's rate established according to this section subject to the following:

(a) If the hospital's bill is paid within thirty days of the date the bill was received, the administration shall pay ninety-nine percent of the rate.

(b) If the hospital's bill is paid after thirty days but within sixty days of the date the bill was received, the administration shall pay one hundred percent of the rate.

(c) If the hospital's bill is paid any time after sixty days of the date the bill was received, the administration shall pay one hundred percent of the rate plus a fee of one percent per month for each month or portion of a month following the sixtieth day of receipt of the bill until the date of payment.

6. In developing the reimbursement methodology, if a review of the reports filed by a hospital pursuant to section 36-125.04 indicates that further investigation is considered necessary to verify the accuracy of the information in the reports, the administration may examine the hospital's records and accounts related to the reporting requirements of section 36-125.04. The administration shall bear the cost incurred in connection with this examination unless the administration finds that the records examined are significantly deficient or incorrect, in which case the administration may charge the cost of the investigation to the hospital examined.

7. Except for privileged medical information, the administration shall make available for public inspection the cost and charge data and the calculations used by the administration to determine payments under the tiered per diem system, provided that individual hospitals are not identified by name. The administration shall make the data and calculations available for public inspection during regular business hours and shall provide copies of the data and calculations to individuals requesting such copies within thirty days of receipt of a written request. The administration may charge a reasonable fee for the provision of the data or information.

8. The prospective tiered per diem payment methodology for inpatient hospital services shall include a mechanism for the prospective payment of inpatient hospital capital related costs. The capital payment shall include hospital specific and statewide average amounts. For tiered per diem rates beginning on October 1, 1999, the capital related cost component is frozen at the blended rate of forty percent of the hospital specific capital cost and sixty percent of the statewide average capital cost in effect as of January 1, 1999 and as further adjusted by the calculation of tier rates for maternity and nursery as prescribed by law.  Through September 30, 2011, the administration shall adjust the capital related cost component by the data resources incorporated market basket index for prospective payment system hospitals.

9. For graduate medical education programs:

(a) Beginning September 30, 1997, the administration shall establish a separate graduate medical education program to reimburse hospitals that had graduate medical education programs that were approved by the administration as of October 1, 1999. The administration shall separately account for monies for the graduate medical education program based on the total reimbursement for graduate medical education reimbursed to hospitals by the system in federal fiscal year 1995-1996 pursuant to the tiered per diem methodology specified in this section. The graduate medical education program reimbursement shall be adjusted annually by the increase or decrease in the index published by the global insight hospital market basket index for prospective hospital reimbursement.  Subject to legislative appropriation, on an annual basis, each qualified hospital shall receive a single payment from the graduate medical education program that is equal to the same percentage of graduate medical education reimbursement that was paid by the system in federal fiscal year 1995-1996. Any reimbursement for graduate medical education made by the administration shall not be subject to future settlements or appeals by the hospitals to the administration. The monies available under this subdivision shall not exceed the fiscal year 2005-2006 appropriation adjusted annually by the increase or decrease in the index published by the global insight hospital market basket index for prospective hospital reimbursement, except for monies distributed for expansions pursuant to subdivision (b) of this paragraph.

(b) The monies available for graduate medical education programs pursuant to this subdivision shall not exceed the fiscal year 2006-2007 appropriation adjusted annually by the increase or decrease in the index published by the global insight hospital market basket index for prospective hospital reimbursement. Graduate medical education programs eligible for such reimbursement are not precluded from receiving reimbursement for funding under subdivision (c) of this paragraph. Beginning July 1, 2006, the administration shall distribute any monies appropriated for graduate medical education above the amount prescribed in subdivision (a) of this paragraph in the following order or priority:

(i) For the direct costs to support the expansion of graduate medical education programs established before July 1, 2006 at hospitals that do not receive payments pursuant to subdivision (a) of this paragraph. These programs must be approved by the administration.

(ii) For the direct costs to support the expansion of graduate medical education programs established on or before October 1, 1999.  These programs must be approved by the administration.

(c) The administration shall distribute to hospitals any monies appropriated for graduate medical education above the amount prescribed in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this paragraph for the following purposes:

(i) For the direct costs of graduate medical education programs established or expanded on or after July 1, 2006.  These programs must be approved by the administration.

(ii) For a portion of additional indirect graduate medical education costs for programs that are located in a county with a population of less than five hundred thousand persons at the time the residency position was created or for a residency position that includes a rotation in a county with a population of less than five hundred thousand persons at the time the residency position was established. These programs must be approved by the administration.

(d) The administration shall develop, by rule, the formula by which the monies are distributed.

(e) Each graduate medical education program that receives funding pursuant to subdivision (b) or (c) of this paragraph shall identify and report to the administration the number of new residency positions created by the funding provided in this paragraph, including positions in rural areas.  The program shall also report information related to the number of funded residency positions that resulted in physicians locating their practices in this state.  The administration shall report to the joint legislative budget committee by February 1 of each year on the number of new residency positions as reported by the graduate medical education programs.

(f) Local, county and tribal governments and any university under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents may provide monies in addition to any state general fund monies appropriated for graduate medical education in order to qualify for additional matching federal monies for providers, programs or positions in a specific locality and costs incurred pursuant to a specific contract between the administration and providers or other entities to provide graduate medical education services as an administrative activity. Payments by the administration pursuant to this subdivision may be limited to those providers designated by the funding entity and may be based on any methodology deemed appropriate by the administration, including replacing any payments that might otherwise have been paid pursuant to subdivision (a), (b) or (c) of this paragraph had sufficient state general fund monies or other monies been appropriated to fully fund those payments. These programs, positions, payment methodologies and administrative graduate medical education services must be approved by the administration and the centers for medicare and medicaid services. The administration shall report to the president of the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives and the director of the joint legislative budget committee on or before July 1 of each year on the amount of money contributed and number of residency positions funded by local, county and tribal governments, including the amount of federal matching monies used.

(g) Any funds appropriated but not allocated by the administration for subdivision (b) or (c) of this paragraph may be reallocated if funding for either subdivision is insufficient to cover appropriate graduate medical education costs.

10. Notwithstanding section 41-1005, subsection A, paragraph 9, the administration shall adopt rules pursuant to title 41, chapter 6 establishing the methodology for determining the prospective tiered per diem payments that are in effect through September 30, 2014.

11. For inpatient hospital services rendered on or after October 1, 2011, the prospective tiered per diem payment rates are permanently reset to the amounts payable for those services as of October 1, 2011 pursuant to this subsection.

12. The administration shall adopt a diagnosis-related group based hospital reimbursement methodology consistent with title XIX of the social security act for inpatient dates of service on and after October 1, 2014.  The administration may make additional adjustments to the inpatient hospital rates established pursuant to this section for hospitals that are publicly operated or based on other factors, including the number of beds in the hospital, the specialty services available to patients, the geographic location and diagnosis-related group codes that are made publicly available by the hospital pursuant to section 36-437. The administration may also provide additional reimbursement for extraordinarily high cost cases that exceed a threshold above the standard payment. The administration may also establish a separate payment methodology for specific services or hospitals serving unique populations.

H. The director may adopt rules that specify enrollment procedures, including notice to contractors of enrollment. The rules may provide for varying time limits for enrollment in different situations. The administration shall specify in contract when a person who has been determined eligible will be enrolled with that contractor and the date on which the contractor will be financially responsible for health and medical services to the person.

I. The administration may make direct payments to hospitals for hospitalization and medical care provided to a member in accordance with this article and rules.  The director may adopt rules to establish the procedures by which the administration shall pay hospitals pursuant to this subsection if a contractor fails to make timely payment to a hospital. Such payment shall be at a level determined pursuant to section 36-2904, subsection H or I.  The director may withhold payment due to a contractor in the amount of any payment made directly to a hospital by the administration on behalf of a contractor pursuant to this subsection.

J. The director shall establish a special unit within the administration for the purpose of monitoring the third-party payment collections required by contractors and noncontracting providers pursuant to section 36-2903, subsection B, paragraph 10 and subsection F and section 36-2915, subsection E.  The director shall determine by rule:

1. The type of third-party payments to be monitored pursuant to this subsection.

2. The percentage of third-party payments that is collected by a contractor or noncontracting provider and that the contractor or noncontracting provider may keep and the percentage of such payments that the contractor or noncontracting provider may be required to pay to the administration. Contractors and noncontracting providers must pay to the administration one hundred percent of all third-party payments that are collected and that duplicate administration fee-for-service payments. A contractor that contracts with the administration pursuant to section 36-2904, subsection A may be entitled to retain a percentage of third-party payments if the payments collected and retained by a contractor are reflected in reduced capitation rates. A contractor may be required to pay the administration a percentage of third-party payments that are collected by a contractor and that are not reflected in reduced capitation rates.

K. The administration shall establish procedures to apply to the following if a provider that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider seeks to collect from an individual or financially responsible relative or representative a claim that exceeds the amount that is reimbursed or should be reimbursed by the system:

1. On written notice from the administration or oral or written notice from a member that a claim for covered services may be in violation of this section, the provider that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider shall investigate the inquiry and verify whether the person was eligible for services at the time that covered services were provided. If the claim was paid or should have been paid by the system, the provider that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider shall not continue billing the member.

2. If the claim was paid or should have been paid by the system and the disputed claim has been referred for collection to a collection agency or referred to a credit reporting bureau, the provider that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider shall:

(a) Notify the collection agency and request that all attempts to collect this specific charge be terminated immediately.

(b) Advise all credit reporting bureaus that the reported delinquency was in error and request that the affected credit report be corrected to remove any notation about this specific delinquency.

(c) Notify the administration and the member that the request for payment was in error and that the collection agency and credit reporting bureaus have been notified.

3. If the administration determines that a provider that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider has billed a member for charges that were paid or should have been paid by the administration, the administration shall send written notification by certified mail or other service with proof of delivery to the provider that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider stating that this billing is in violation of federal and state law. If, twenty-one days or more after receiving the notification, a provider that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider knowingly continues billing a member for charges that were paid or should have been paid by the system, the administration may assess a civil penalty in an amount equal to three times the amount of the billing and reduce payment to the provider that has a contract with a contractor or noncontracting provider accordingly. Receipt of delivery signed by the addressee or the addressee's employee is prima facie evidence of knowledge.  Civil penalties collected pursuant to this subsection shall be deposited in the state general fund. Section 36-2918, subsections C, D and F, relating to the imposition, collection and enforcement of civil penalties, apply to civil penalties imposed pursuant to this paragraph.

L. The administration may conduct postpayment review of all claims paid by the administration and may recoup any monies erroneously paid. The director may adopt rules that specify procedures for conducting postpayment review.  A contractor may conduct a postpayment review of all claims paid by the contractor and may recoup monies that are erroneously paid.

M. Subject to title 41, chapter 4, article 4, the director or the director's designee may employ and supervise personnel necessary to assist the director in performing the functions of the administration.

O. Notwithstanding any other law, on federal approval the administration may make disproportionate share payments to private hospitals, county operated hospitals, including hospitals owned or leased by a special health care district, and state operated institutions for mental disease beginning October 1, 1991 in accordance with federal law and subject to legislative appropriation. If at any time the administration receives written notification from federal authorities of any change or difference in the actual or estimated amount of federal funds available for disproportionate share payments from the amount reflected in the legislative appropriation for such purposes, the administration shall provide written notification of such change or difference to the president and the minority leader of the senate, the speaker and the minority leader of the house of representatives, the director of the joint legislative budget committee, the legislative committee of reference and any hospital trade association within this state, within three working days not including weekends after receipt of the notice of the change or difference. In calculating disproportionate share payments as prescribed in this section, the administration may use either a methodology based on claims and encounter data that is submitted to the administration from contractors or a methodology based on data that is reported to the administration by private hospitals and state operated institutions for mental disease. The selected methodology applies to all private hospitals and state operated institutions for mental disease qualifying for disproportionate share payments.

P. Disproportionate share payments made pursuant to subsection O of this section include amounts for disproportionate share hospitals designated by political subdivisions of this state, tribal governments and universities under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents. Subject to the approval of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, any amount of federal funding allotted to this state pursuant to section 1923(f) of the social security act and not otherwise spent under subsection O of this section shall be made available for distribution pursuant to this subsection. Political subdivisions of this state, tribal governments and universities under the jurisdiction of the Arizona board of regents may designate hospitals eligible to receive disproportionate share payments in an amount up to the limit prescribed in section 1923(g) of the social security act if those political subdivisions, tribal governments or universities provide sufficient monies to qualify for the matching federal monies for the disproportionate share payments.

Q. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the administration may receive confidential adoption information to determine whether an adopted child should be terminated from the system.

R. The adoption agency or the adoption attorney shall notify the administration within thirty days after an eligible person receiving services has placed that person's child for adoption.

S. If the administration implements an electronic claims submission system, it may adopt procedures pursuant to subsection G of this section requiring documentation different than prescribed under subsection G, paragraph 4 of this section.

T. In addition to any requirements adopted pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 4 of this section, notwithstanding any other law, subject to approval by the centers for medicare and medicaid services, beginning July 1, 2011, members eligible pursuant to section 36-2901, paragraph 6, subdivision (a), section 36-2931 and section 36-2981, paragraph 6 shall pay the following:

1. A monthly premium of fifteen dollars, except that the total monthly premium for an entire household shall not exceed sixty dollars.

2. A copayment of five dollars for each physician office visit.

3. A copayment of ten dollars for each urgent care visit.

J. If there is an insufficient number of, or an inadequate member capacity in, contracts awarded to contractors, the director, in order to deliver covered services to members enrolled or expected to be enrolled in the system within a county, may negotiate and award, without bid, a contract with a health care services organization holding a certificate of authority pursuant to title 20, chapter 4, article 9. The director shall require a health care services organization contracting under this subsection to comply with section 36-2906.01. The term of the contract shall not extend beyond the next bid and contract award process as provided in section 36-2906 and shall be no greater than capitation rates paid to contractors in the same county or counties pursuant to section 36-2906.

In determining eligibility for the system, the administration shall consider payments from the trust regardless of the purpose for which the payment is made.

G. Notwithstanding this section, a trust that is established before August 11, 1993 shall be evaluated in accordance with the provisions contained in the state plan.

If benefits for the system are continued by the administration pending a decision by the director after a hearing on a proposed adverse action that results from trust income or disbursements and the director upholds the administration, the administration shall apply the adverse action on a prospective basis.

I. The administration shall consider trust disbursements issued in violation of this section as a transfer in accordance with 42 United States Code section 1396p.

J. If the administration determines that the trustee is in violation of this section or the terms of a new or existing trust, the administration shall consider all trust assets held in the trust and income held in or produced by the trust, available to the beneficiary under 42 United States Code section 1396p(d)(3) until the trustee corrects the violation unless considering the assets and income available would create an undue hardship for the beneficiary.

#### Section 36-2935. Estate recovery program; liens

A. The director shall adopt rules establishing a uniform statewide preadmission screening program to determine if a person who has met the eligibility criteria prescribed in section 36-2934 is eligible for institutional services pursuant to this article. To be eligible for institutional services or home and community based services as defined in section 36-2931, a person shall have a nonpsychiatric medical condition or have a developmental disability as defined in section 36-551 that, by itself or in combination with other medical conditions, necessitates the level of care that is provided in a nursing facility or intermediate care facility. These rules shall establish a uniform preadmission screening instrument that assesses the functional, medical, nursing, social and developmental needs of the applicant.

B. A person is not eligible to receive home and community based services unless that person has been determined to need institutional services as determined by the preadmission screening instrument pursuant to subsection D of this section. The administration shall establish guidelines for the periodic reassessment of each member.

C. Preadmission screening conducted pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be conducted telephonically or virtually, unless the administration determines it is necessary to conduct the assessment in person or the applicant being screened or the applicant's representative requests an in-person assessment. The administration shall provide notice to applicants that the purpose of preadmission screening is to conduct a meaningful review of an applicant's medical needs, functional capacity, social and developmental needs and emotional and cognitive behaviors.  The notice shall inform applicants that the applicant or the applicant's representative may request an in-person assessment and may request accommodations in the preadmission screening process under the Americans with disabilities act of 1990.

D. Preadmission screening conducted pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be conducted by a registered nurse who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 15 or by a social worker. The nurse or social worker shall have a physician who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 available for consultation and may use the applicant's attending physician's physical assessment form, if appropriate, in assessing needs for long-term care services under this article. A physician who receives a referral from the nurse or social worker may use the physician's medical judgment to determine the medical eligibility of an applicant for the system or the continued medical eligibility of a member or eligible person. In the medical referral, the physician shall use the established combined thresholds for functional ability and medical condition as a guide to determine the risk of institutionalization.

E. If a person who is eligible for services pursuant to this article, who is enrolled with a program contractor pursuant to this article and who is enrolled with a program contractor pursuant to section 36-2940 fails the preadmission screening for institutional services pursuant to subsection A of this section at the time of a reassessment, the administration may administer a second preadmission screening designed to measure the functioning level of the person based on rules adopted by the director. If the person meets the established thresholds of the functional preadmission screening, the person is eligible for home and community based services pursuant to section 36-2939, subsection A, paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, subsection B, paragraph 2 and subsection C. If a person who is determined eligible pursuant to this subsection is institutionalized pursuant to section 36-2939, including residence in an intermediate care facility, institution for mental disease, inpatient psychiatric facility or nursing facility, the person has a maximum of ninety days to vacate the institutional setting and relocate to a home and community based setting approved pursuant to section 36-2939.

F. If the person is determined not to need services pursuant to this section, the administration shall provide the person with information on other available community services.

G. The administration or its designee shall complete the preadmission screening under subsection A of this section within eight days, excluding Saturdays and holidays, and excluding the time period allowed to determine eligibility pursuant to section 36-2934.

H. If a provider who contracts with the administration pursuant to section 36-2904, subsection A is dissatisfied with any action or decision of the administration regarding the eligibility of a person for the system as prescribed in this article, that provider may file a grievance in accordance with the provider grievance procedure prescribed in section 36-2932, subsection I, paragraph 1. If the director determines pursuant to the grievance process that the person should have been determined eligible pursuant to section 36-2933, the director may reimburse the provider for the net cost of services provided pursuant to this article after the cumulative time periods allowed pursuant to section 36-2934 and this section.

I. In addition to those persons seeking services pursuant to this article, the preadmission screening conducted pursuant to this section shall be made available to all other persons applying for admission to a nursing care institution. The cost of preadmission screenings conducted by the administration pursuant to this subsection shall be borne by the state.

If there is not a sufficient number of qualified proposals, a subcontract may be negotiated with a provider and shall be awarded pursuant to section 41-2536. In order to deliver covered services to members enrolled or expected to be enrolled in the system within a county, the program contractor may negotiate and award without bid a provider subcontract if during the contract year there is an insufficient number of subcontracts awarded to providers. The term of the subcontract shall not extend beyond the next bid and subcontract award process as provided in this section, and the subcontract shall be at rates no greater than the weighted average rates for the appropriate level of care paid to similar providers in the same county. This section does not allow a program contractor to forego the competitive bid process pursuant to section 41-2534 unless there is an unanticipated increase in members enrolled in the system or a decrease in available beds brought about by the closure of a facility operated by a provider that is unable to be absorbed by current contracting providers located in the same general area. Before soliciting subcontracts without the competitive bid process, the program contractor shall receive approval from the director.

E. Payments to program contractors pursuant to this section shall be made monthly or quarterly and may be subject to contract provisions requiring the retention of a specified percentage of the payment by the director, a reserve fund or other contract provisions by which adjustments to the payments are made based on utilization efficiency, including incentives for maintaining quality care and minimizing unnecessary inpatient services. Reserve funds withheld from contracts shall be distributed to program contractors who meet performance standards established by the director. Any reserve fund established pursuant to this subsection shall be established as a separate account within the Arizona long-term care system fund.

F. Payments made pursuant to this section shall begin after a member is enrolled in the system.

G. Each program contractor pursuant to this section shall submit an annual audited financial and programmatic report for the preceding fiscal year as required by the administration.

If the directive requires provision of treatment, food or fluids that would have a significant possibility of sustaining the patient's life, the provider shall ensure the provision until the transfer is completed.

B. A health care provider has a duty to volunteer and otherwise disclose information about the patient's health status and care to the patient's surrogate to the same degree that the provider owes this duty to the patient.

B. Health care provider acts and refusals to act made in reliance on the provisions of a health care directive or directions of a surrogate are presumed to be made in good faith.

C. A health care provider is not subject to criminal or civil liability or professional discipline for any of the following:

1. Failing to comply with a decision or a direction that violates the provider's conscience if the provider promptly makes known the provider's unwillingness and promptly transfers the responsibility for the patient's care to another provider who is willing to act in accordance with the agent's direction.

2. Failing to consult a patient with a disability or incapacitated patient's surrogate if the surrogate cannot be contacted after the health care provider has made a reasonable effort to do so or if an emergency situation does not provide the health care provider with sufficient time to locate and consult with the surrogate.

3. Relying on a court order concerning a patient.

4. A guardian's failure to comply with section 14-5303, subsection B relating to the requirement that the petition include a statement that the authority granted to the guardian may include the authority to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment, including artificial food and fluid.

D. This section does not relieve a health care provider from civil or criminal liability or prevent a provider from being subjected to professional disciplinary action for the provider's negligent treatment of a patient if the negligence is unrelated to the provider's reliance on a health care directive, directions from a surrogate or the recommendations of an institutional ethics committee pursuant to section 36-3231.

 

#### Section 36-3206. Enforcement or challenge of a directive or decision; judicial proceedings; automatic stays

A. An interested person may file a verified petition with the superior court to determine the validity or effect of a health care directive or the decision of a surrogate.

B. The petition shall include the following information:

2. The name and address of any health care provider known by the petitioner to be providing health care to the principal.

3. If a health care directive exists, a description or a copy of the health care directive.

4. The judicial relief sought by the petitioner.

C. On the filing of the petition, the court shall enter a temporary order directing compliance with section 36-3203, subsection E.  Notice of this order shall be provided by personal service on the surrogate, the patient, the health care providers immediately responsible for the patient's care and other persons the court requires to be notified.

D. The court shall review the petition, any other pleadings on file and any evidence offered by the petitioner to determine if it should order temporary orders without a further hearing. The court may enter a temporary order directing the provision or the withholding of specific medical treatment pending a further hearing if the court determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that health care decisions are being made by a surrogate or a health care provider that derogate the patient's wishes or, if the patient's wishes are not known, the patient's best interests.

E. The court shall schedule and conduct a hearing within five working days of the filing of a petition. Notice shall be provided by personal service on the surrogate, the patient, the health care providers immediately responsible for the patient's care, and other persons the court requires to be notified.

F. On the filing of the petition the court may:

1. Appoint an attorney for the patient if it appears that this is in the patient's best interests.

2. Appoint an investigator as provided under section 14-5308 or a physician, or both, to evaluate the patient and submit a written report to the court before the hearing.

3. Enter other temporary orders that the court determines are necessary and appropriate to protect the wishes or the best interests of the patient, including an order exercising the power of a guardian or appointing a temporary guardian as provided under section 14-5310.

G. A person filing a petition under this section is not required to post a bond unless the court determines that a bond is necessary to protect the interests of any party.

H. If a petition is filed to challenge the decision of a guardian to permanently withdraw the artificial administration of food and fluid from a patient who is in an irreversible coma or is in a persistent vegetative state that the patient's doctor believes is irreversible or incurable, there is a rebuttable presumption that a patient who does not have a valid living will, power of attorney or other health care directive has directed the patient's health care providers to provide the patient with food and fluid to a degree that is sufficient to sustain life, including, if necessary, through a medically invasive procedure, by way of the gastrointestinal tract or intravenously, and that that provision is in the patient's best interests.

I. The presumption pursuant to subsection H of this section may be rebutted only if either of the following applies:

1. In reasonable medical judgment any of the following applies:

(a) The provision of food or fluid is not medically possible.

(b) The provision of food or fluid would hasten death.

(c) Because of the medical condition of the patient, the patient would be incapable of digesting or absorbing the food or fluid so that its provision would not contribute to sustaining the patient's life or provide physical comfort to the patient.

2. The court finds both of the following by clear and convincing evidence:

(a) The patient is in an irreversible coma or is in a persistent vegetative state that is irreversible or incurable.  Evidence that the patient is in an irreversible coma or is in a persistent vegetative state that is irreversible or incurable must be supported by either of the following:

(i) The opinion of an independent physician who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 and who is a specialist in neurology.  The petitioner, the patient or the patient's attorney may present additional evidence of the patient's medical condition that is supported by the opinion of a physician selected by that party.

(ii) If a specialist in neurology is not available, the opinion of an independent physician who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 and who has examined the patient specifically to assess whether the patient is in an irreversible coma or a persistent vegetative state that is irreversible or incurable supported by a recommendation of the institutional bioethics committee of the health care facility.

(b) While competent the patient manifested the patient's intent that medically invasive life prolonging treatment, including the artificial administration of food or fluid, not be administered in the case of an irreversible coma or a persistent vegetative state that is irreversible or incurable.

J. On notice and a hearing, the court may enter appropriate orders to safeguard the wishes of the patient. If the court is unable to determine those wishes, the court may enter appropriate orders to safeguard the patient's best interest. These orders may include:

1. Appointing a surrogate if the procedural requirements of title 14, chapter 5, article 3 have been met.

2. Removing an agent or any other surrogate and appointing a successor.

3. Directing compliance with the terms of the patient's health care directive, including the provisional removal or withholding of treatment if the court finds that this conforms with the patient's wishes or, if the patient's wishes are not known, is in the patient's best interest.

4. Directing the transfer of the patient to a suitable facility or to the care of a health care provider who is willing to comply with the patient's wishes.

5. Assessing court costs and attorney fees against a party found to have proceeded in bad faith.

K. Notwithstanding a person's incapacity, the court may deny a petition to appoint a guardian for that person based on the existence of a valid and unrevoked health care directive.

L. A guardian appointed pursuant to this section is immune from civil and criminal liability to the same extent as any other surrogate pursuant to section 36-3203, subsection D.

M. A superior court order that authorizes a guardian to permanently withdraw food or fluid from a patient who is in an irreversible coma or in a persistent vegetative state that is irreversible or incurable is automatically stayed for five business days to allow a party, or that party's successor in interest in the event of the original party's death, to seek an expedited appeal with the court of appeals.  A decision from the court of appeals is automatically stayed for five business days to allow a party, or that party's successor in interest in the event of the original party's death, to seek review by the supreme court.  Food or fluid shall not be permanently withdrawn pending a decision on the merits of the case by the court of appeals or a decision on a petition by the supreme court.

A. A person shall not require a person to execute or prohibit a person from executing a health care directive as a condition for providing health care services or insurance.

B. An insurer shall not refuse to pay for goods or services under a patient's insurance policy because the decision to use the goods or services was made by the patient's surrogate.

C. If a patient's death follows the withholding or withdrawing of any medical care pursuant to a surrogate's decision not expressly precluded by the patient's health care directive, that death does not constitute a homicide or a suicide and does not impair or invalidate an insurance policy, an annuity or any other contract that is conditioned on the life or death of the patient regardless of any terms of that contract.

#### Section 36-3208. Prior and out of state health care directives; validity

A health care directive prepared before September 30, 1992, or prepared in another state, district or territory of the United States is valid in this state if it was valid in the place where and at the time when it was adopted and only to the extent that it does not conflict with the criminal laws of this state.

#### Section 36-3209. Health care directives; conflicts

A. If there are conflicts among the provisions of valid health care directives, the most recent directive is deemed to represent the wishes of the patient.

B. Notwithstanding any other law, if there is a conflict between a provision of a valid health care directive, the decision of a patient's agent pursuant to a valid health care power of attorney or the decision of a surrogate decision maker pursuant to section 36-3231 and a health care provider's order, including an order regarding life-sustaining treatment or a similar document, the health care directive, the decision of the patient's agent or the decision of the surrogate decision maker is presumed to represent the decision of the patient.

 

#### Section 36-3210. Suicide; mercy killing

This chapter does not approve or authorize suicide, assisted suicide or mercy killing.

#### Section 36-3211. Principals; significant relationships; contact orders; definitions

C. A person who has a significant relationship with the principal and whose contact with the principal has been limited, restricted or prohibited by an agent may petition the court for an order compelling the agent to allow the person to have contact with the principal. The petition shall describe the nature of the relationship between the person and the principal and the type and frequency of contact being requested.  The person has the burden of proving that the person has a significant relationship with the principal and that the requested contact is in the principal's best interest.  The petition and notice of the hearing on the petition shall be personally served on the principal and the agent and shall be provided to any other persons the court orders.

A principal whose contact with a person who has a significant relationship with the principal has been limited, restricted or prohibited by an agent may petition the court for an order compelling the agent to allow the principal to have contact with the person.  The petition shall describe the nature of the relationship between the person and the principal and the type and frequency of contact being requested. The principal has the burden of proving that the person has a significant relationship with the principal and that the requested contact is in the principal's best interest.  The petition and notice of the hearing on the petition shall be personally served on the agent and the person whose contact will be affected and shall be provided to any other persons the court orders.

E. If an agent who does not have authority expressly granted in a health care directive to limit, restrict or prohibit contact between the principal and another person reasonably believes that contact between the principal and the person is not in the principal's best interest, the agent may petition the court for an order that limits, restricts or prohibits contact between the person and the principal.  The petition shall describe the nature of the relationship between the person and the principal and the limitations or restrictions on the contact being requested and why the limitations or restrictions are in the principal's best interest.  If the agent requests an order that prohibits all contact between a person and the principal because the contact would be detrimental to the principal's physical or emotional health or well-being, the agent shall file with the court a written statement or report of a physician, psychologist, physician assistant or registered nurse who has recently evaluated the principal and who supports this position. The petition and notice of the hearing on the petition shall be personally served on the principal and the person whose contact will be affected and shall be provided to any other persons the court orders.

F. In determining what, if any, contact between a person and the principal is in the principal's best interest, the court shall consider all factors that are relevant to the principal's health, safety and welfare, including the following:

2. If the principal has sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice, the wishes of the principal.

2. May appoint an investigator as provided under section 14-5308 or a physician, or both, to evaluate the principal and submit a written report to the court before the hearing.

3. May enter any other temporary order that the court determines is necessary and appropriate to protect the wishes or best interests of the principal, including an order exercising the power of a guardian or appointing a temporary guardian as provided under section 14-5310.

4. May issue, without notice, a temporary protective order that limits, restricts or prohibits contact between the principal and another person if the petition is supported by a written statement or report of a physician, psychologist, physician assistant or registered nurse who has recently evaluated the principal and the court finds, based on the statement or report and other specific facts shown by affidavit or verified petition, reasonable grounds to believe that contact between the principal and the person before the matter can be heard would result in immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage to the principal.  The temporary protective order expires on the date prescribed by the court but not later than fourteen days after the order is entered, unless within that time the court extends the order for good cause shown or the person whose contact is limited, restricted or prohibited consents to the extension.  If the temporary protective order is issued, the court shall require that the petition and order be personally served on the principal and the person whose contact is the subject of the order within the time ordered by the court but not more than seventy-two hours after entry of the order.  If the court issues a temporary protective order without notice, the principal or the person whose contact has been limited, restricted or prohibited may file a motion requesting that the order be dissolved or modified.  The person filing the motion shall cause a copy of the motion to be personally served on the agent and any other person the court orders.  The court shall proceed to hear and determine the motion as expeditiously as possible.

H. Except as provided in subsection G, paragraph 4 of this section, the petitioner shall cause notice of the time and place of hearing of any petition filed under this section to be given at least fourteen days before the hearing.

J. A principal, an agent or a person who has a significant relationship with the principal may petition the court to modify a contact order if a material change in circumstances affecting the principal's health, safety or welfare has occurred since the last contact order was entered.  The petition shall be supported by an affidavit alleging the change of circumstances that has occurred since the entry of the last contact order.  The court shall deny the petition unless the court finds that the petition establishes good cause for a hearing, in which case the court shall set a hearing on the petition.  The petition and notice of the hearing on the petition shall be served on the principal, the agent and the person whose contact is being considered and shall be provided to any other persons the court orders.

K. A principal, an agent or a person who has a significant relationship with the principal may file a motion asking the court to temporarily modify or suspend a contact order if a material change in circumstances affecting the principal's health, safety or welfare has occurred since the last contact order was entered.  The motion shall be supported by an affidavit alleging the change of circumstances that has occurred since the entry of the last contact order.  The motion shall be filed contemporaneously with or after the filing of a petition to modify the prior contact order. The motion shall state whether the petitioner requests that the prior contact order be modified or suspended with or without notice to affected persons.

L. The court may temporarily modify or suspend a contact order without notice only if both of the following apply:

1. It clearly appears from specific facts shown in the motion or affidavit that immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage likely will result if the order is not issued before the affected persons can be heard in opposition.

2. The moving party or the moving party's attorney certifies to the court in writing the efforts, if any, that the moving party or the moving party's attorney has made to give the notice or the reasons supporting the claim that notice should not be required.

M. If the court grants a motion to temporarily modify or suspend a contact order without notice, the court shall set a hearing on the motion.

N. An order temporarily modifying or suspending a contact order that is granted without notice shall state the injury, loss or damage that would likely have occurred if the order were not issued before giving the affected persons the opportunity to be heard in opposition.  The temporary order expires at the date and time set for the hearing on the motion unless the temporary order is extended by the court for good cause.

O. The moving party shall personally serve a copy of the order and notice of the hearing on the person whose contact with the principal has been modified or suspended without notice within the time period the court directs but not more than seventy-two hours after entry of the order.  The moving party shall personally serve a copy of the order and notice of hearing on the principal or the agent if either person is not the moving party.

P. On notice and a hearing, the court may enter appropriate orders to safeguard the wishes of the principal if those wishes can be reasonably ascertained. The court may assess court costs, reasonable attorney fees and the cost of any professionals appointed to evaluate the principal against a party found to have proceeded in bad faith or to have acted unreasonably.

#### Section 36-3231. Surrogate decision makers; priorities; limitations

A. If an adult patient is unable to make or communicate health care treatment decisions, a health care provider shall make a reasonable effort to locate and shall follow a health care directive. A health care provider shall also make a reasonable effort to consult with a surrogate. If the patient has a health care power of attorney that meets the requirements of section 36-3221, the patient's designated agent shall act as the patient's surrogate.  However, if the court appoints a guardian for the express purpose of making health care treatment decisions, that guardian shall act as the patient's surrogate. If neither of these situations applies, the health care provider shall make reasonable efforts to contact the following individual or individuals in the indicated order of priority, who are available and willing to serve as the surrogate, who then have the authority to make health care decisions for the patient and who shall follow the patient's wishes if they are known:

1. The patient's spouse, unless the patient and spouse are legally separated.

2. An adult child of the patient. If the patient has more than one adult child, the health care provider shall seek the consent of a majority of the adult children who are reasonably available for consultation.

3. A parent of the patient.

4. If the patient is unmarried, the patient's domestic partner.

5. A brother or sister of the patient.

6. A close friend of the patient. For the purposes of this paragraph, "close friend" means an adult who has exhibited special care and concern for the patient, who is familiar with the patient's health care views and desires and who is willing and able to become involved in the patient's health care and to act in the patient's best interest.

B. If the health care provider cannot locate any of the people listed in subsection A of this section, the patient's attending physician may make health care treatment decisions for the patient after the physician consults with and obtains the recommendations of an institutional ethics committee.  If this is not possible, the physician may make these decisions after consulting with a second physician who concurs with the physician's decision. For the purposes of this subsection, "institutional ethics committee" means a standing committee of a licensed health care institution appointed or elected to render advice concerning ethical issues involving medical treatment.

C. A person who makes a good faith medical decision pursuant to this section is immune from liability to the same extent and under the same conditions as prescribed in section 36-3205.

D. A surrogate may make decisions about mental health care treatment on behalf of a patient if the patient is found incapable.  However, a surrogate who is not the patient's agent or guardian shall not make decisions to admit the patient to an inpatient psychiatric facility licensed by the department of health services, except as provided in subsection E of this section or section 14-5312.01, 14-5312.02 or 36-3281.

E. If the admitting officer for a mental health care provider has reasonable cause to believe after examination that the patient is incapable as defined in section 36-3281 and is likely to suffer serious physical harm or serious illness or to inflict serious physical harm on another person without immediate hospitalization, the patient may be admitted for inpatient treatment in an inpatient psychiatric facility based on informed consent given by any surrogate identified in subsection A of this section.  The patient shall be discharged if a petition for court ordered evaluation or for temporary guardianship requesting authority for the guardian to consent to admission to an inpatient psychiatric facility has not been filed within forty-eight hours of admission or on the following court day if the forty-eight hours expires on a weekend or holiday.  The discharge requirement prescribed in this section does not apply if the patient has given informed consent to voluntary treatment or if a mental health care provider is prohibited from discharging the patient under federal law.

For the purposes of this article, "cardiopulmonary resuscitation" includes cardiac compression, endotracheal intubation and other advanced airway management, artificial ventilation, defibrillation, administration of advanced cardiac life support drugs and related emergency medical procedures.

F. Emergency medical system personnel, hospital emergency department personnel and direct care staff persons who make a good faith effort to identify the patient and who rely on an apparently genuine directive or a photocopy of a directive on orange paper are immune from liability to the same extent and under the same conditions as prescribed in section 36-3205.  If a person has any doubt as to the validity of a directive or the medical situation, that person shall proceed with resuscitative efforts as otherwise required by law.  Emergency medical system personnel and direct care staff persons are not required to accept or interpret medical care directives that do not meet the requirements of this section.

G. In the absence of a physician, a person without vital signs who is not resuscitated pursuant to a prehospital medical care directive may be pronounced dead by any peace officer of this state, a professional nurse licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 15 or an emergency medical technician certified pursuant to this title.

H. This section does not apply to situations involving mass casualties or to medical emergencies involving children and adults with disabilities in public or private schools that are not licensed health care institutions as defined in section 36-401.

### Article 5 - Living Will

#### Section 36-3261. Living will; verification; liability

If a person has a health care power of attorney, the agent must make health care decisions that are consistent with the person's known desires and that are medically reasonable and appropriate. A person can, but is not required to, state the person's desires in a living will. The following form is offered as a sample only and does not prevent a person from using other language or another form:

Living Will

If the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the department of health services determines that the person's mental disorder has so changed that the person is not likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative, the superintendent or director shall allow the person to petition the court for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative.  The person shall serve the petition on the court and the attorney for the state.  The court shall hold a hearing on the petition for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative within forty-five days after receiving the petition. The court may continue the hearing on the request of either party and a showing of good cause or on its own motion if the respondent will not be substantially prejudiced.  The county attorney or the attorney general shall represent the state at the hearing and may request that the petitioner be examined by a competent professional selected by the county attorney or the attorney general.  The attorney for the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the petitioner's mental disorder has not changed and that the petitioner remains a danger to others and is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative or unconditionally discharged.

B. This section does not prohibit the committed person from annually petitioning the court for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative without the approval of the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the department of health services.  The director of the department of health services shall give annual written notice to the committed person of the person's right to petition the court for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative without the approval of the superintendent or director.  The notice shall contain a waiver of rights. The director shall submit the notice and waiver to the court with the annual examination report.

C. The committed person may be present at the hearing.  The county attorney or the attorney general may request that the person be examined by a competent professional selected by the attorney for the state.  The committed person may retain and the court on request of an indigent person may appoint a competent professional.  The attorney for the state has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the person's mental disorder has not changed and that the person remains a danger to others and is likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative.  If the state does not meet its burden of proof, the person shall be discharged from treatment.

D. If at the conclusion of a hearing the court finds that there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis to conclude that the conditions prescribed in section 36-3711 have been met, the court shall grant the state's motion for a judgment on the issue of conditional release to a less restrictive alternative.

#### Section 36-3710. Conditional release to a less restrictive alternative; conditions; reports; review

A. If the court determines that conditional release to a less restrictive alternative is in the best interest of the person and will adequately protect the community and the court determines that the minimum conditions under section 36-3711 are met, the court shall enter judgment and order the person's conditional release to a less restrictive alternative.

B. The court may impose any additional conditions on the person that the court determines are necessary to ensure the person's compliance with treatment and to protect the community. If the court finds that conditions do not exist that will both ensure the person's compliance with treatment and protect the community, the court shall remand the person to the custody of the superintendent of the state hospital for care, supervision or treatment in a licensed facility that is under the supervision of the superintendent.

C. If the provider that is designated to provide inpatient or outpatient treatment or to monitor or supervise any other terms and conditions of a person's placement in a less restrictive alternative is not the state hospital, the provider shall agree in writing to provide the treatment.

D. Before the court authorizes a person's conditional release to a less restrictive alternative, the court shall impose any conditions on the person that the court determines are necessary to ensure the safety of the community. The conditions shall include that prior to release to a less restrictive alternative, a person shall be required to submit to ninety days of inpatient evaluation at the Arizona state hospital. At the discretion of the superintendent of the state hospital, the duration of the evaluation period may be less than ninety days. The court shall order the superintendent of the state hospital to investigate the less restrictive alternative and to submit additional conditions to the court. The court shall give a copy of the conditions of release to the person and to any designated service provider. Other conditions may include any of the following:

1. Specification of a residence.

2. Prohibition on any contact with potential or past victims.

6. Other conditions that the court or the superintendent of the state hospital determines are in the best interest of the person or others.

E. Following a determination that a person's release to a less restrictive alternative is warranted and after considering the recommendation regarding the duration and amount of treatment by the superintendent of the state hospital, the court shall require as a condition of release to a less restrictive alternative, that the person participate in outpatient treatment. The outpatient supervision and treatment may include monitoring a person by use of a polygraph or plethysmograph or both. The treatment shall continue until the court orders a change in the person's treatment requirements or the person is discharged pursuant to section 36-3714.

F. Each month or as otherwise directed by the court, each designated service provider shall submit a report that states if the person is complying with the terms and conditions of the conditional release to a less restrictive alternative to:

1. The court.

In making its determination, the court shall consider the periodic reports that are submitted to the court pursuant to subsection F of this section and the opinions of the superintendent of the state hospital and any other competent professional.

H. If a person is conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative, the department of health services shall notify the department of public safety of the person's release so that the department of public safety can commence any notification process as provided in section 13-3825.

#### Section 36-3711. Conditional release to a less restrictive alternative; findings

Before the court orders that a person be conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative, the court shall find that all of the following apply:

1. The person will be treated by a provider who is qualified to provide the necessary treatment in this state.

2. The provider presents a specific course of treatment for the person, agrees to assume responsibility for the person's treatment, will report on the person's progress to the court on a regular basis and will report any violations as prescribed in paragraphs 4 and 5 of this section immediately to the court, the attorney for the state and the superintendent of the state hospital.

3. The person who is conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative has housing arrangements that are sufficiently secure to protect the community and the person or agency that is providing the housing to the conditionally released person agrees in writing to the following conditions:

The facility shall allow a responsible relative to inspect the property, subject to any limitations that the person specifically imposes.

D. This article does not prohibit a person who is committed or conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative from exercising any right that is available for the purpose of obtaining release from confinement, including the right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The committed person must exhaust all direct appeal and postcommitment procedures before exercising the committed person's right to petition for a writ of habeas corpus.

E. A person who is indigent may not be conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative or discharged without suitable clothing.

The court shall be notified before the close of the next judicial day of the person's detention. The attorney for the state and the conditionally released person may request an immediate mental examination of the person. If the conditionally released person is indigent, the court, on request, shall assist the person in obtaining a competent professional to conduct the examination.

C. Within five days after receiving notice of the person's detention, the court shall schedule a hearing. At the hearing, the court shall determine if the state has proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the person who is conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative did not comply with the terms and conditions of release, is in need of additional care or treatment or if the circumstances of the release have changed so that the community is no longer safe and if the person should continue on conditional release under the same or modified conditions or if the conditional release should be revoked and the person should be committed to total confinement, subject to release only under the provisions of this chapter.

(Eff. 1/1/24)

 

A.

The committed defendant shall serve the petition on the court and the attorney for the state.  The court shall hold a hearing on the petition for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative within forty-five days after receiving the petition.

(Eff. 1/1/24)

 

A. If the court determines that conditional release to a less restrictive alternative is in the best interest of the committed defendant and will adequately protect the community and the court determines that the minimum conditions under section 36-4006 are met, the court shall enter judgment and order the committed defendant's conditional release to a less restrictive alternative.

B. If the court concludes that the only reason the committed defendant does not meet the standard for continued commitment is the effect of treatment or habilitation being received, the court may deny the request for conditional release to a less restrictive alternative unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the committed defendant will continue to receive treatment and habilitation following release for as long as the treatment and habilitation is required.  If the court finds that the committed defendant will continue to receive the needed treatment or habilitation, the court may order the committed defendant to be conditionally released to a less restrictive alternative on the condition that the committed defendant continue to receive treatment or habilitation.  If the committed defendant fails to receive the treatment or habilitation ordered, the court may revoke the conditional release.

C. The court may impose any additional conditions on the committed defendant that the court determines are necessary to ensure the committed defendant's compliance with treatment and to protect the community.

F. Following a determination that a committed defendant's release to a less restrictive alternative is warranted and after considering the recommendation regarding the duration and amount of treatment by the medical director, the court shall require as a condition of release to a less restrictive alternative that the committed defendant participate in outpatient treatment. The outpatient supervision and treatment may include monitoring a committed defendant by use of an electronic bracelet.  The treatment shall continue until the court orders a change in the committed defendant's treatment requirements or the committed defendant is discharged pursuant to section 36-4009.
