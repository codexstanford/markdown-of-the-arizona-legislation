Filing of a statement of claim shall be complete upon timely receipt by the department of a properly executed statement of claim and a five dollar filing fee for each such claim.  The director shall deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, the fees received pursuant to this subsection in the water resources fund established by section 45-117.

 

#### Section 45-184. Waiver and relinquishment of water right

Any person who is claiming the right to divert or withdraw public waters of the state based on state law and who fails to file a statement of claim as provided in this article shall have waived and relinquished any right, title or interest in that right.

#### Section 45-185. Filing of claim not deemed adjudication of right; presumption; exemption

A. The filing of a statement of claim under this article does not constitute an adjudication of any claim to the right to the use of waters as between the person and the state, or as between one or more persons asserting the water right, and the date of filing under this article shall have no effect upon the priority of such rights. A statement of claim is not admissible in evidence for the purpose of demonstrating that water diverted or withdrawn and beneficially used is appropriable under section 45-141, subsection A, but a statement of claim is admissible in evidence as a rebuttable presumption of the truth and accuracy of the contents of the claim.

B. Wells used to produce water exclusively for domestic or stock watering purposes are exempt from the provisions of this article, but the granting of this exemption shall not establish the presumption that a water right exists.

#### Section 45-186. Water rights claims registry

All claims set forth pursuant to this article shall be filed in a water rights claims registry in such a manner as deemed appropriate by the director.

#### Section 45-187. No rights acquired by adverse use or adverse possession

No rights to the use of public waters of the state may be acquired by adverse use or adverse possession as between the person and the state, or as between one or more persons asserting the water right, but nothing contained herein shall be deemed to diminish or enhance the validity of a claim filed under this article originating prior to the effective date of chapter 164 of the laws of 1919.

#### Section 45-188. Future rights acquired through appropriation; rights within service area of agricultural or municipal provider

A. Any person who is entitled to divert or withdraw public waters of the state through an appropriation and evidenced by a certificate of water right issued under article 5 of this chapter, a court decree, or previous possession or continued beneficial use and who intentionally abandons the use thereof or who voluntarily fails, without sufficient cause, to beneficially use all or any part of the right to withdraw for any period of five successive years shall relinquish such right or portion thereof. The rights relinquished shall revert to the state, and the waters affected by such rights shall become available for appropriation to the extent they are not lawfully claimed or used by existing appropriators.

B. If a use or claim is subject to forfeiture by nonuse, failure by the appropriator to use water within a five year period does not result in a forfeiture of the associated water right if water use is resumed before the occurrence of the earlier of any of the following:

1. The initiation of proceedings pursuant to section 45-189 to determine whether the right has been forfeited or abandoned.

2. The filing by a third party of a statement of claimant in a general adjudication instituted pursuant to article 9 of this chapter that asserts the right to use water from the stream in which the subject nonuse has occurred.

3. The assertion by a third party of written objections in response to an application by the appropriator to sever and transfer the right pursuant to section 45-172.

C. Conservation of water pursuant to a water conservation plan notice filed with the director as prescribed by section 45-189.01 does not constitute an abandonment or forfeiture of the water conserved.

A. When it appears to the director that a person entitled to the use of water has not beneficially used all or a portion of the water right for a period of five or more consecutive years, and it appears that the right has or may have reverted to the state because of such nonuse, as provided by section 45-141 and section 45-188, subsection A, the director shall notify such person to show cause at an administrative hearing why the right or portion of the right should not be declared relinquished.

B. The notice shall contain:

A description of the water right, including the approximate location of the point of diversion, the general description of the lands or places where such waters were used, the water source, the amount involved, the purpose of use, the apparent authority on which the right is based and the factual basis for the notice to show cause.

3. A statement that unless sufficient cause is shown the water right will be declared relinquished.

C. The notice shall be served at least thirty days before the hearing.

D. The director shall make an order determining whether such water right has been relinquished and give notice to each party of the order by serving such persons at their last known addresses.

E. For the purposes of this section, section 45-141, subsection C and section 45-188, subsection A, the following reasons shall be sufficient cause for nonuse:

1. Drought, or other unavailability of water.

(b) After a change in the permitted use from irrigation to municipal pursuant to a court decree or section 45-156 or 45-172, insufficient demand for the water by the municipal users.

9. Any other reason that a court of competent jurisdiction deems would warrant nonuse.

F. Section 45-114, subsections A and B govern administrative proceedings, rehearing or review and judicial review of final decisions of the director under this section.

#### Section 45-189.01. Water conservation plan notice; filing; exemption; duration

A. Beginning on September 29, 2021, a person who is entitled to the use of water may file with the director a water conservation plan notice.  A water conservation plan notice shall include the following:

1. The name and address of the person who is entitled to the use of water that is included in the water conservation plan.

2. A description of all water rights and claims that the person who is entitled to use those water rights and claims is including in the water conservation plan.

3. The place and purpose of the use of the identified water rights and claims and the historical and current water use.

4. A description of any water conservation measures that will be implemented as part of the water conservation plan.

2. After the expiration of the ninety day period prescribed by paragraph 1 of this subsection and before the conclusion of hearings by the master for a subwatershed or federal reservation within the river system and source, a person may assert a claim for a water use within the subwatershed or federal reservation without leave of the court by filing the original of the statement of claimant or amended statement of claimant with the director and a notice of filing with the court. After the conclusion of hearings on an existing claim, an amendment to that existing statement of claimant may only be permitted as prescribed by paragraph 3 of this subsection. If a statement of claimant or an amendment to a statement of claimant is filed after the expiration of the ninety day period, other parties may object to the elements of the claim or amended claim.

3. After the master has completed hearings on a subwatershed or federal reservation within the river system and source and has filed a report with the court for the entire subwatershed or federal reservation pursuant to section 45-257, a person may not assert a late claim for a water right within that subwatershed or reservation as a matter of right.  A person may request the court's permission to intervene in the adjudication and file a statement of claimant with the director. The court may grant the motion if it finds that the intervention would not unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties. An amendment to an existing statement of claimant after the filing of the master's report for the entire subwatershed or federal reservation is permitted only by leave of the court in its discretion and on motion of the party seeking an amendment. Other parties may object to the elements of a claim or an amended claim filed pursuant to this paragraph.

F. On entry of the final decree pursuant to section 45-257, any potential claimant who is properly served and who failed to file a statement of claimant as prescribed by this article for any water right or whose motion for permissive intervention was finally denied by the court is barred and estopped from subsequently asserting any right that was previously acquired on the river system and source and that was not included in a statement of claimant and forfeits any rights to the use of water in the river system and source that were not included in a properly filed statement of claimant.

G. On March 17, 1995, all statements of claimant previously filed in an adjudication pending under this article are deemed to be timely filed. An objection to the timeliness of any statement of claimant that was filed before March 17, 1995 in an adjudication pending under this article is not permitted.

H. The fee for filing a statement of claimant by an individual is twenty dollars and by a corporation, municipal corporation, the state or any political subdivision, an association or partnership is two cents for every acre-foot of water claimed, or twenty dollars, whichever is greater.  The director shall review the statements of claimant and the amount of fees paid as to each and report to the court or master the sufficiency of the fees paid with respect to each statement of claimant. A claim shall not be considered by the court or the master unless all fees with respect to such claim have been fully paid in accordance with the provisions of this article. Fees shall not be imposed on any Indian tribe, community or allottee personally appearing in the general adjudication to assert claims to water.

 

#### Section 45-255. Appointment of master; compensation

A. The superior court judge assigned to the adjudication may appoint a master or masters under rule 53 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure to report on legal and factual issues designated under a specific order of reference.

B. A master's compensation and other expenses related to the conduct of an adjudication shall be fixed by the court and paid out of the fund of fees paid by the claimants pursuant to section 45-254. If that fund of fees is insufficient, a master's compensation and other expenses related to the conduct of an adjudication shall be paid from the state general fund as a separate line item appropriation for the superior court.

 

#### Section 45-256. Technical assistance of director; report

A. The court or the master shall request technical assistance from the director in all aspects of the general adjudication with respect to which the director possesses hydrological or other expertise. In rendering such technical assistance, the director shall expeditiously:

1. Identify the hydrological boundaries of the river system and source and the names and addresses of all reasonably identifiable potential claimants. In identifying potential claimants, the director, at a minimum, shall identify as far as reasonably possible the current record owners of all real property within the geographical scope of the adjudication.

2. Locate, procure and make available all public and other records relevant to determination of any factual or legal issues.

3. Conduct a general investigation or examination of the river system and source.

4. Investigate or examine the facts pertaining to the claim or claims asserted by each claimant.

5. Make a map or plat on a scale not less than one inch to the mile adequate to show with substantial accuracy the course of the river system and source, the location of the ditch or canal diverting water from such river system and source, and the legal subdivisions of lands that have been irrigated or are susceptible to irrigation from the ditches and canals already constructed.

6. Take such other steps and gather such other information as may be necessary or desirable for a proper determination of the relative rights of the parties.

B. The technical assistance rendered by the director shall be set forth in summary form on a claim by claim basis in a report prepared by the director and filed with the court or the master, which shall then be available for inspection by any claimant. The report shall list all information that is obtained by the director and that reasonably relates to the water right claim or use investigated. The report shall also include the director's proposed water right attributes for each individual water right claim or use investigated as prescribed by this article. If no water right is proposed in connection with an individual water right claim or use, the director's recommendations shall so indicate. Any claimant may file with the court or the master written objections to the report or any part of the report within one hundred eighty days of the date on which the report was filed. An objection shall specifically address the director's recommendations regarding the particular water right claim or use investigated. The court or master shall summarily dismiss with prejudice objections that do not comply with this subsection.  Each claimant who has filed timely written objections that comply with this subsection shall have a fair and reasonable opportunity to present evidence in support of or in opposition to those recommendations of the director.  Any claimant may present evidence in support of the claimant's claim.

C. Those portions of the report that do not contain the director's recommendations for the water rights claims and uses investigated shall not be summarily admitted into evidence but may be offered into evidence for any purpose relevant to the determination of a water right claim or use that is subject to adjudication. The appropriator and any other claimant who has filed an objection to the water right as prescribed by subsection B of this section shall have a fair and reasonable opportunity to present evidence in support of or in opposition to those portions of the director's report before the conclusion of hearings on the water right. If admitted into evidence over an objection, those portions of the report shall not be given any presumption of correctness.

D. Information that is included in the director's report and that describes a water right claim or use of five hundred acre-feet or less per year for any type of use claimed shall be summarily admitted into evidence. If conflicting evidence is presented, the director's proposed attributes of the water right shall be given the weight deemed appropriate by the master and the court consistent with this article.

E. Information that is included in the director's report and that describes a water right claim or use of more than five hundred acre-feet per year shall not be summarily admitted into evidence. If offered into evidence and if admitted over objection, it shall be given no presumption of correctness.

F. Claimants who are in agreement with those parts of the report that describe the claimants' water right claims or uses are not required to file objections to the report and may rely on the report as evidence of their water right. If the owner of a water right claim or use provides evidence in support of the report, that evidence shall be presented after all evidence has been introduced by the objectors.

G. On request of any party, the director shall present evidence concerning the facts stated in the report. This section shall not be construed to prevent the court or the master from issuing a protective order on a showing of good cause.

H. Before filing the report with the court or the master as provided in subsection B of this section, the director shall prepare a preliminary report.  The director shall give notice to each water claimant that the preliminary report is available for inspection and comment. Upon expiration of the period provided for timely comment, the director shall revise the preliminary report as may be appropriate and shall file the report with the court or the master in accordance with subsection B of this section. At least one hundred twenty days before the final report is to be filed, the director shall file with the court a notice stating the date on which the final report is to be filed. The director shall adopt such rules as may be necessary to ensure that adequate notice is given, that the preliminary report is sufficiently available for inspection by the water claimants and that provisions are made for adequate time and procedure for comment on the preliminary report.

#### Section 45-257. Hearings; report of master; final judgment by court; administration and enforcement of decree

A. The master shall:

1. After due notice, conduct such hearings and take such testimony as shall be necessary to determine the relative water rights of each claimant. The determination of water rights of all small water use claims in any specific subwatershed shall be deferred until all other claims in that subwatershed are determined by the superior court in the course of the adjudication, except that for a claimant who asserted a small water use claim and who asserted other water use claims in the same subwatershed that are not small water use claims, the claimant's small water use claim shall be determined in conjunction with the determination of that claimant's other claims. This paragraph does not preclude the superior court or the master from approving settlements of small water use claims at any time during the course of the adjudication.

B. A true copy of the map identifying the boundaries of the Santa Cruz active management area shall be on file in the department and shall be available for examination by the public during regular business hours. A true copy of the map shall also be filed in the office of the county recorder in the counties in which the active management area is located.

#### Section 45-411.04. Declaration of policy and intent; Santa Cruz active management area

A. The legislature finds that the hydrology and water resource management issues within the upper Santa Cruz river basin are unique due to the international nature of the river basin. The Tucson active management area includes areas beyond the one hundred kilometer border region established by treaties and agreements between the United States and Mexico relating to environmental issues. It is the finding of the legislature that a new active management area is needed in the immediate vicinity of the United States/Mexico border for the upper Santa Cruz river basin in order to facilitate binational negotiations for coordinated management of the water resources of the Santa Cruz river. It is the further finding of the legislature that the proposed boundaries designated for the Santa Cruz active management area are based on hydrologic parameters, such that the portion of the Santa Cruz river in Arizona has similar hydrologic characteristics with that portion of the Santa Cruz river in the State of Sonora, Mexico.

B. The legislature also finds that the coordinated management of surface water rights and groundwater rights set forth in this enactment has been specifically designed to address the unique problems for water resource management that are described in subsection A of this section and that are posed by the hydrology of the upper Santa Cruz river. Coordinated management of surface water rights and groundwater rights is necessary in the area designated as the Santa Cruz active management area for public health, safety and welfare reasons.

C. It is the express intent of the legislature that the creation of the Santa Cruz active management area is not to affect the definition of, or rights to, the surface waters and the groundwaters within this state, or to establish any precedent that could be used in a court of law to define, limit, or extend the rights of this state or the United States of America over the surface waters and groundwaters found within this state or to define or limit the legal distinction between surface water and groundwater in this state.

D. The legislature finds that the varied water interests within the Santa Cruz active management area have sought the creation of this active management area to facilitate their own participation in the coordinated management of the water resources within this active management area and participation in the negotiations for binational coordination of water resource planning for the upper Santa Cruz active management area. While the coordinated management can include all naturally occurring waters within the basin, it is not the intent of any party in the Santa Cruz active management area or this legislature to modify or amend in any way the fundamental laws and rights to surface water and groundwater pursuant to the laws of this state.

#### Section 45-412. Subsequent active management areas; criteria; review of groundwater basins not subject to active management

A. The director may designate an area which is not included within an initial active management area, pursuant to section 45-411, as a subsequent active management area if the director determines that any of the following exists:

1. Active management practices are necessary to preserve the existing supply of groundwater for future needs.

2. Land subsidence or fissuring is endangering property or potential groundwater storage capacity.

3. Use of groundwater is resulting in actual or threatened water quality degradation.

B. An active management area designated pursuant to this section may include more than one groundwater basin but shall not be smaller than a groundwater basin or include only a portion of a groundwater basin, except for the regional aquifer systems of northern Arizona.

C. The director shall periodically review all areas which are not included within an active management area to determine whether such areas meet any of the criteria for active management areas as prescribed in this section.

#### Section 45-413. Hearing on designation of subsequent active management areas and boundaries; notice; procedures

A. If the director proposes to designate a subsequent active management area pursuant to section 45-412, subsection A, the director shall hold a public hearing to consider:

1. Whether to issue an order declaring the area an active management area.

2. The boundaries and any sub-basins of the proposed active management area.

The form of the petition shall be the same as for initiative petitions, and the applicant for the petition shall comply with section 19-111.

B. On application for a petition number with the clerk of the board of supervisors or county election officer, the director shall transmit a map of the groundwater basin to the county recorder of each county in which the proposed active management area is located. The map shall be on a scale adequate to show with substantial accuracy where the boundaries of the groundwater basin cross the boundaries of county voting precincts. The director shall also transmit to the county recorder all other factual data concerning the boundaries of the groundwater basin that may aid the county recorder in the determination of which registered voters of the county are residents of the groundwater basin.

C. Any registered voter of a county whose residency in the groundwater basin is in question shall be allowed to vote. The ballot shall be placed in a separate envelope, the outside of which shall contain the precinct name and number, the signature of the voter, the residence address of the voter and the voter registration number of the voter, if available. The voter receipt card shall be attached to the envelope. The county recorder shall verify the ballot for proper residency of the voter before counting. Such verification shall be made within five business days following the election, and the voter receipt card shall be returned to the voter. Verified ballots shall be counted using the procedure outlined for counting early ballots. If residency in the groundwater basin is not verified, the ballot shall remain unopened and shall be destroyed.

D. Except as provided in subsection E of this section, all election expenses incurred pursuant to this section are the responsibility of the county involved.

E. If a groundwater basin is located in two or more counties, the following procedures apply:

1. The petition shall be filed with the clerk of the board of supervisors or county election officer of the county in which the plurality of the registered voters in the groundwater basin resides.

2. The number of registered voters required to sign the petition shall be ten percent of the registered voters residing within the boundaries of the proposed active management area, as of the most recent report compiled by the county recorder in compliance with section 16-168, subsection G, within the county in which the plurality of the registered voters in the groundwater basin resides.

3. The election shall be called by the board of supervisors of the county in which the petition is filed, and the board shall immediately notify the board of supervisors of any other county included in the groundwater basin of the date of the election. The election shall be held not less than sixty days or more than ninety days from the date of the call. The board of supervisors so notified shall then call the election in that county for the same date and follow the procedures for conducting the general elections in this state.

4. All election expenses incurred pursuant to this subsection are the responsibilities of the counties involved on a proportional basis considering the number of registered voters of each county that are residents of the groundwater basin.

F. The ballot shall be worded, "should the (insert name of basin) groundwater basin be designated an active management area?" followed by the words "yes" and "no".

#### Section 45-416. Limitation on number of irrigated acres

A. If the director initiates the procedure for designating a subsequent active management area or the board of supervisors calls an election to establish an active management area, an irrigation user may irrigate within the proposed active management area only acres of land which were legally irrigated at any time during the five years preceding the date of the notice of the initiation of designation procedures or the call for the election.

B. The limitation on the acres which may be irrigated shall continue in effect until the director makes a final determination pursuant to section 45-414 or the final results of an election to establish an active management area pursuant to section 45-415 are certified by the board of supervisors of the county or counties in which the proposed subsequent active management area is located.

2. The withdrawal of water from a well shall be subject to any applicable well location requirements contained in article 10 of this chapter.

#### Section 45-452. No new irrigated acreage in active management areas; central Arizona project water; exemption

A. In an initial active management area, except as provided in subsections B, H, I and J of this section and sections 45-172, 45-465.01 and 45-465.02, only acres of land which were legally irrigated at any time from January 1, 1975 through January 1, 1980, which are capable of being irrigated, which have not been retired from irrigation for a non-irrigation use pursuant to section 45-463 or 45-469 and for which the irrigation grandfathered right has not been conveyed for a non-irrigation use, may be irrigated with any groundwater, effluent, diffused water on the surface or surface water, except that this does not prohibit irrigation with surface water used pursuant to decreed or appropriative rights established before June 12, 1980. In an initial active management area, land which was not irrigated at any time from January 1, 1975 through January 1, 1980 is deemed to have been in irrigation if the director finds that either of the following applies:

1. In areas of an initial active management area not designated as critical groundwater areas under prior statutory law prior to the date of the designation of the active management area, land is deemed to have been in irrigation if substantial capital investment has been made for the subjugation of such land for an irrigation use including on-site irrigation distribution facilities and a well or wells the drilling and construction of which were substantially commenced prior to the date of the designation of the active management area.

2. In areas of an initial active management area which were designated as critical groundwater areas under prior statutory law, land is deemed to have been in irrigation if substantial capital investment has been made in the twelve months before June 12, 1980 for the improvement of the land and on-site irrigation distribution facilities, including the drilling of wells, for an irrigation use. This paragraph does not allow irrigation of land which could not have been legally irrigated under prior statutory law.

B. In an initial active management area, a person who owns acres of land which may be irrigated pursuant to subsection A of this section may apply to the director to permanently retire all or a portion of such acres from irrigation and to irrigate conjunctively with central Arizona project water the same number of substitute acres. The director may approve the substitution of acres if the director determines that all of the following exist:

1. The substitute acres were legally irrigated during the period of September 30, 1958 to September 30, 1968, or such other period as the United States secretary of the interior may designate.

2. The acres to be retired from irrigation and the substitute acres are located outside of the exterior boundaries of the service area of a city, town or private water company and such acres are located within the same irrigation district and the same sub-basin.

3. The substitution of acres is necessary to enable the irrigation district within which the acres are located to more efficiently deliver central Arizona project water.

4. Central Arizona project water available to the irrigation district within which the acres are located will be adequate to supply the substitute acres.

5. The substitution of acres will benefit the management of the active management area in which the acres are located.

C. Any acres permanently retired from irrigation pursuant to subsection B of this section relinquish their irrigation grandfathered rights, and such rights are deemed to be appurtenant to the substitute acres. Groundwater withdrawn or received for the irrigation of the substitute acres pursuant to an irrigation grandfathered right shall be reduced by the amount of central Arizona project water received for such acres.

D. The service area of the irrigation district in which the acres are located shall be modified to permanently delete the acres permanently retired from irrigation and include the substitute acres.

E. If a person retires land from irrigation pursuant to subsection B of this section, groundwater shall not be withdrawn from such retired land for any purpose unless pursuant to a groundwater withdrawal permit or unless withdrawn by a city, town or private water company within the service area of such city, town or private water company.

F. The director may reverse the substitution of irrigated acres as provided by subsections B through E of this section under the following conditions and procedures:

1. Title to the retired acres and substitute acres has reverted involuntarily, or voluntarily in lieu of foreclosure or forfeiture, to a previous owner or owners of the retired and substitute acres.

2. The current owner of the retired acres must apply to the director in writing stating:

(a) The history of the original substitution of acres under subsections B through E of this section.

(b) The circumstances regarding the reversion of title to the current owner or owners.

(c) Why reversal of the substitution of acres is necessary.

3. The director must find that reversing the substitution of acres:

(a) Will benefit the management of the active management area.

(b) Is necessary to prevent unreasonable hardship to the current owner of the retired acres.

(c) Will not cause unreasonable hardship to the current owner of the substitute acres, if owned separately from the retired acres.

4. If the director decides to reverse the substitution of acres:

(a) The originally retired irrigation acres regain their original irrigation grandfathered rights, but groundwater withdrawn or received for the irrigation of those acres pursuant to an irrigation grandfathered right shall be reduced by any amount of central Arizona project water received for such acres.

(b) The substitute acres relinquish all irrigation grandfathered rights that were transferred to them under the original substitution of acres.

(c) The service area of the irrigation district in which the acres are located shall be modified to delete the substitute acres and include the originally retired irrigation acres.

(d) Groundwater may not thereafter be withdrawn from the substitute acres for any purpose unless pursuant to a groundwater withdrawal permit or unless withdrawn by a city, town or private water company within its service area.

G. In a subsequent active management area, except as provided in subsections H, I and J of this section or section 45-172, only acres of land which were legally irrigated at any time during the five years preceding the date of the notice of the initiation of designation procedures or the call for the election, which are capable of being irrigated, which have not been retired from irrigation for a non-irrigation use pursuant to section 45-463 or 45-469 and for which the irrigation grandfathered right has not been conveyed for a non-irrigation use, may be irrigated with groundwater, effluent, diffused water on the surface or surface water, except that this does not prohibit irrigation with surface water used pursuant to decreed or appropriative rights established before the date of the notice or the call. In a subsequent active management area, land is deemed to have been in irrigation if the director finds that either of the following applies:

1. In areas of a subsequent active management area which were not irrigation non-expansion areas, land is deemed to have been in irrigation if substantial capital investment has been made for the subjugation of such land for an irrigation use including on-site irrigation distribution facilities and a well or wells the drilling and construction of which were substantially commenced before the date of the notice of the initiation of designation procedures or the call for the election.

2. In areas of a subsequent active management area which were irrigation non-expansion areas, land is deemed to have been in irrigation if the director finds that substantial capital investment has been made in the twelve months before the date of the notice of the initiation of designation procedures or the call for the election, for the improvement of the land and on-site irrigation distribution facilities, including the drilling of wells, for an irrigation use. This paragraph does not allow irrigation of land which could not have been legally irrigated under section 45-437.

H. In an active management area, a state university engaged in the teaching and study of and experimentation in the science of agriculture may irrigate not more than three hundred twenty acres of land for such purposes with not more than five acre-feet of groundwater per acre per year. Water produced from any well pursuant to this subsection shall not be leased, sold or transported off the irrigated land operated by the state university. The right to withdraw and use groundwater pursuant to this subsection does not require a withdrawal permit, is not a grandfathered right, shall not give rise to a grandfathered right and may not be conveyed to any other user.

I. In an active management area, a correctional facility under the jurisdiction of the state department of corrections may irrigate with groundwater, effluent, diffused water on the surface or surface water up to a total of ten acres of land that otherwise may not be irrigated pursuant to subsection A or G of this section if the irrigation is for the purpose of producing plants or parts of plants for consumption by inmates at the correctional facility as part of a prisoner work program and if the correctional facility notifies the director of water resources in writing of the location of the acres of land to be irrigated prior to their irrigation. The actual number of acres of land that a correctional facility may irrigate pursuant to this subsection shall be calculated by subtracting the number of acres of land the correctional facility may already irrigate under subsection A or G of this section from ten. The amount of water that a correctional facility may use during a year to irrigate acres of land pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed an amount calculated by multiplying the number of acres of land that are actually irrigated by the correctional facility during the year pursuant to this subsection, by four and one-half acre-feet of water. The right to withdraw and use groundwater pursuant to this subsection does not require an irrigation grandfathered right, is not a grandfathered right, shall not give rise to a grandfathered right, and may not be conveyed to any other user.

J. During the second management period, acres of land in an active management area which have been retired from irrigation for a non-irrigation use pursuant to section 45-463 or 45-469 or for which the irrigation grandfathered right has been conveyed for a non-irrigation use pursuant to section 45-472 may be irrigated with effluent, other than effluent recovered pursuant to a recovery well permit issued under chapter 3.1 of this title or effluent given or received pursuant to a water exchange under chapter 4 of this title, and shall retain its appurtenant type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right where the following conditions are met:

1. The land to be irrigated lies within the boundaries of an incorporated city or town.

2. The governing body or manager of the city or town has consented in writing to the irrigation of the land with effluent.

3. The effluent proposed for irrigation of the land cannot be reasonably beneficially used otherwise.

4. The owner of the land gives written notice to the director of intention to irrigate the land with effluent and receives written approval from the director before commencing irrigation. The notice shall set forth the legal description of the land to be irrigated, the certificate number of the type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right appurtenant to the land, the source of effluent and the reasons the effluent cannot be reasonably beneficially used otherwise, and shall be accompanied by a copy of the written consent of the city or town in which the land to be irrigated is located.

K. A person who may irrigate with effluent land to which a type 1 non-irrigation right is appurtenant under subsection J of this section may relinquish the right to irrigate all or a portion of the land by giving the director written notice that the person relinquishes the right. The notice shall include a legal description of the acres to be relinquished. The relinquishment is effective upon receipt of the notice by the director.

L. If a person who may irrigate with effluent land to which a type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right is appurtenant under subsection J of this section conveys all or a portion of the land to a successor owner, the successor owner shall not irrigate the land prior to providing written notification to the director of the successor owner's intention to irrigate the land and receiving approval from the director pursuant to subsection J of this section.

M. Section 45-114, subsections A and B govern administrative proceedings, rehearing or review and judicial review of final decisions of the director under this section. If an administrative hearing is held, it shall be conducted in the active management area in which the use is located.

#### Section 45-453. Groundwater rights and uses in areas outside active management areas; amounts; transportation; irrigation non-expansion areas

In areas outside of active management areas, a person may:

1. Withdraw and use groundwater for reasonable and beneficial use, except as provided in article 8.1 of this chapter.

2. Transport groundwater pursuant to articles 8 and 8.1 of this chapter.

3. Use groundwater for irrigation purposes within the exterior boundaries of an irrigation non-expansion area only pursuant to article 3 of this chapter.

#### Section 45-454. Exemption of small non-irrigation wells; definitions

A. Withdrawals of groundwater for non-irrigation uses from wells having a pump with a maximum capacity of not more than thirty-five gallons per minute which were drilled before April 28, 1983 or which were drilled after April 28, 1983 pursuant to a notice of intention to drill which was on file with the department on such date are exempt from this chapter, except that:

1. Wells drilled before June 12, 1980 which are not abandoned or capped or wells which were not completed on June 12, 1980 but for which a notice of intention to drill was on file with the Arizona water commission on such date are subject to subsections J, K and L of this section and must be registered pursuant to section 45-593.  If two or more wells in an active management area are exempt under this paragraph and are used to serve the same non-irrigation use at the same location, the aggregate quantity of groundwater withdrawn from the wells shall not exceed fifty-six acre-feet per year.

2. Wells drilled between June 12, 1980 and April 28, 1983, except as provided in paragraph 1 of this subsection, and wells drilled after April 28, 1983 pursuant to a notice of intention to drill which was on file with the department on April 28, 1983, are subject to subsections G, I, J and K of this section.

1. Such wells are subject to subsections G through K of this section.

2. In an active management area, other than a subsequent active management area designated for a portion of a groundwater basin in the regional aquifer systems of northern Arizona, withdrawals of groundwater from such wells for non-irrigation uses other than domestic purposes and stock watering shall not exceed ten acre-feet per year.

3. In a subsequent active management area that is designated for a portion of a groundwater basin in the regional aquifer systems of northern Arizona, groundwater withdrawn from such wells may be used only for domestic purposes and stock watering.

C. On or after January 1, 2006, an exempt well otherwise allowed by this section may not be drilled on land if any part of the land is within one hundred feet of the operating water distribution system of a municipal provider with an assured water supply designation within the boundaries of an active management area established on or before July 1, 1994, as shown on a digitized service area map provided to the director by the municipal provider and updated by the municipal provider as specified by the director.

D. On request from the owner of the land on which an exempt well is prohibited pursuant to subsection C of this section on a form prescribed by the director, the director shall issue an exemption from subsection C of this section if the landowner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that any of the following applies:

1. The landowner submitted a written request for service to the municipal provider that operates the distribution system and the municipal provider did not provide written verification to the landowner within thirty calendar days after receipt of the request that water service is available to the landowner after payment of any applicable fee to the municipal provider.

2. The total capital cost and fees for connecting to the operating water distribution system exceed the total capital cost and fees for drilling and fully equipping an exempt well.

3. If the applicant must obtain an easement across other land to connect to the water distribution system of the municipal provider, the applicant sent the owner of the land a request for the easement by certified mail, return receipt requested, and either the applicant did not receive a response to the request within thirty calendar days of mailing the request or the request was denied.

4. The landowner does not qualify for an exemption pursuant to paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of this subsection and the landowner provides written verification from the municipal provider that the landowner shall not receive or request water service from the municipal provider while the exempt well is operational.  The exemption for that well is revoked if the landowner or any subsequent landowner receives water service from the municipal provider.  In determining whether to approve or reject a permit application filed under section 45-599, the director shall not consider any impacts the proposed well may have on an exempt well drilled pursuant to this paragraph.

E. This section does not prohibit a property owner, after January 1, 2006, from drilling a replacement exempt well for a lawful exempt well if the replacement well does not increase the total number of operable exempt wells on the applicant's land.

F. A remediation well drilled for the purpose of remediating groundwater is exempt from this section if it meets one of the following:

1. The remediation well is for an approved department of environmental quality or United States environmental protection agency remediation program.

2. A registered geologist certifies that the remediation well is for the purpose of remediation.

G. A person shall file a notice of intention to drill with the director pursuant to section 45-596 before drilling an exempt well or causing an exempt well to be drilled.

H. The registered well owner shall file a completion report pursuant to section 45-600, subsection B.

I. In an active management area only one exempt well may be drilled or used to serve the same non-irrigation use at the same location, except that a person may drill or use a second exempt well to serve the same non-irrigation use at the same location if the director determines that all of the following apply:

1. Because of its location, the first exempt well is not capable of consistently producing more than three gallons per minute of groundwater when equipped with a pump with a maximum capacity of thirty-five gallons per minute.

2. The second exempt well is located on the same parcel of land as the first exempt well, the parcel of land is at least one acre in size, all groundwater withdrawn from both exempt wells is used on that parcel of land and there are no other exempt wells on that parcel of land.

3. Combined withdrawals from both wells do not exceed five acre-feet per year.

4. If the second exempt well is drilled after January 1, 2000, the county health authority for the county in which the well is located or any other local health authority that controls the installation of septic tanks or sewer systems in the county has approved the location of the well in writing after physically inspecting the well site.

5. Use of two wells for the same non-irrigation use at the same location is not contrary to the health and welfare of the public.

J. An exempt well is subject to sections 45-594 and 45-595.

K. Groundwater withdrawn from an exempt well may be transported only pursuant to articles 8 and 8.1 of this chapter.

In a subsequent active management area, a person who owns land which was legally entitled to be irrigated with groundwater and retires such land from irrigation prior to the date of the designation of the active management area in anticipation of a non-irrigation use has the right to withdraw from or receive for such land the lesser of three acre-feet of groundwater per acre per year or the average annual amount of groundwater which was used per acre during the five years preceding the time the land was retired upon showing that:

1. The land has been held under the same ownership since it was retired.

2. A development plan for the proposed non-irrigation use existed at the time the land was retired and is filed with the director within ninety days after the active management area is designated.

C. The development plan requirements of this section are deemed fulfilled if the land retired from irrigation has been described in an application for a certificate of exemption or if the land retired from irrigation is owned in conjunction with non-irrigation uses existing or for which substantial capital commitments have been incurred for the non-irrigation development of such land as of the date of the designation of the active management area.

D. The right to withdraw or receive groundwater pursuant to this section is a non-irrigation grandfathered right associated with retired irrigated land, or a type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right.

E. A type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right is appurtenant to the acre of retired irrigated land associated with the right, is owned by the owner of the land to which the right is appurtenant and may be leased with the land.

F. At the request of a city or town in the Tucson active management area that holds a type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right under subsection A of this section, the director, in determining whether to designate or redesignate the city or town as having an assured water supply pursuant to section 45-576, shall include four and one-half acre-feet of groundwater for each acre of retired irrigated land to which the right is appurtenant, multiplied by the number of years between the year of retirement and the year of the request, minus the quantity of groundwater withdrawn from the land between June 12, 1980 and the year of the request, except that:

1. No groundwater may be included for any acre of retired irrigated land for any year after the land is developed for any municipal or industrial use.

2. The amount of groundwater that is included under this subsection shall not exceed four and one-half acre-feet for each acre of retired irrigated land to which the right is appurtenant multiplied by the number of years between the year of retirement and December 31, 2025 minus the quantity of groundwater withdrawn from the land between June 12, 1980 and December 31, 2025.

3. The net amount of groundwater included under this subsection shall not exceed two million acre-feet.

4. The city or town, before making the request of the director, shall extinguish any irrigation grandfathered rights or type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered rights held by the city or town and appurtenant to land acquired or contracted for by the city or town after June 12, 1980 in the same sub-basin.

G. In determining whether to designate a city or town as having an assured water supply pursuant to section 45-576, the director shall not consider the exercise of the right to withdraw groundwater under subsection F of this section to be the withdrawal of groundwater available from natural or artificial groundwater recharge.

#### Section 45-464. Type 2 non-irrigation grandfathered right not associated with retired irrigated land; determination of amount; definition; ownership

A. In an active management area, a person who owns land from which groundwater was being legally withdrawn and used for a non-irrigation purpose as of the date of the designation of the active management area has the right to withdraw annually:

1. If the person holds a certificate of exemption, the greater of:

(a) The amount of groundwater established in proceedings on the application for certificate of exemption, subject to any modification as a result of a finding on appeal of a factual mistake by the state land department or Arizona water commission in computing the amount of the authorized withdrawal, less the amount of any right obtained by the person pursuant to section 45-463.

(b) The maximum amount of groundwater legally withdrawn from such land and used by the person in any one of the five years preceding the date of the designation of the active management area, less the amount of any right obtained by the person pursuant to section 45-463.

2. If the person does not hold a certificate of exemption, the maximum amount of groundwater legally withdrawn from such land and used by the person withdrawing the groundwater in any one of the five years preceding the date of the designation of the active management area, less the amount of any right obtained pursuant to section 45-463 by the person withdrawing groundwater from such land which has not been subtracted by the person withdrawing the groundwater in calculating the amount of another right pursuant to this section.

B. If the calculation in subsection A of this section results in an amount greater than zero, that amount is a grandfathered right in addition to any right obtained pursuant to section 45-463.

C. For the purposes of this section, "person" includes:

1. A city, town or private water company which owns land outside of the service area of such city, town or private water company from which groundwater was being legally withdrawn for a non-irrigation use as of the date of the designation of the active management area.

2. A city, town or private water company withdrawing groundwater from within its service area pursuant to a certificate of exemption.

3. Any other non-irrigation user.

D. If a person has been using groundwater for less than one year during the twelve months immediately preceding the date of the designation of the active management area, the amount of the grandfathered right pursuant to this section is the annual amount determined by the director to be reasonable for a full year to meet the requirements for a facility owned by such person in existence as of the date of the designation of the active management area.

E. If a person has received a certificate of environmental compatibility pursuant to title 40, chapter 2, article 6.2 for the construction of an electrical generating facility within a subsequent active management area for which expenditures or financial commitments for land acquisition, water development, materials, construction or engineering in excess of five hundred thousand dollars have been made before the date of the notice of the initiation of designation procedures or the call for the election for the area, the amount of the grandfathered right pursuant to this section is the annual amount determined by the director to be reasonable to meet the operational requirements for the facility for a full year.

F. The right to withdraw groundwater pursuant to this section is a non-irrigation grandfathered right not associated with retired irrigated land, or a type 2 non-irrigation grandfathered right.

G. A type 2 non-irrigation grandfathered right may be leased. Except as provided in subsection H of this section, the owner or lessee of a type 2 non-irrigation grandfathered right may withdraw groundwater pursuant to the right only from a location within the same active management area in which the certificate of grandfathered right is issued.

H. Beginning July 1, 1994, the holder of a type 2 non-irrigation grandfathered right issued in the Tucson active management area prior to July 1, 1994, may withdraw groundwater pursuant to the right only from a location within the same active management area in which the well or wells listed on the certificate of grandfathered right on July 1, 1994, are located. If no well is listed on the certificate of grandfathered right on July 1, 1994, the holder of the right may withdraw groundwater pursuant to the right only from a location within the same active management area in which the land from which the originating withdrawals were made is located. For purposes of this subsection, the term "originating withdrawals" means the withdrawals of groundwater on which the issuance of a type 2 non-irrigation grandfathered right was based.

I. If the user of a type 2 non-irrigation grandfathered right is different from the owner of the right, either the owner, or the user of the right on behalf of the owner, may apply for a certificate of grandfathered right pursuant to section 45-476.

#### Section 45-465. Irrigation grandfathered right; determination of acres entitled to and amount; appurtenancy

A. In an active management area, a person who owns land which was legally irrigated in whole or in part with groundwater at any time during the five years preceding January 1, 1980 for initial active management areas or the date of the notice of the initiation of designation procedures or the call for the election for subsequent active management areas, which is capable of being irrigated and which has not been retired from irrigation for a non-irrigation use pursuant to section 45-463 or 45-469 has the right to use groundwater for the irrigation of such land as determined pursuant to subsections B and C of this section.

B. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, the director shall compute the maximum amount of groundwater which may be used pursuant to this section as follows:

1. Determine the farm units, as defined in section 45-402, within the active management area.

2. Determine the irrigation water duty, as defined in section 45-402, for each farm unit in an active management area, pursuant to sections 45-564 through 45-568.

3. Determine the water duty acres for each farm within the farm unit. The water duty acres are the highest number of acres in the farm, taking land rotation into account, which were legally irrigated during any one year in the five years preceding January 1, 1980 for initial active management areas or the date of the notice of the initiation of designation procedures or the call for the election for subsequent active management areas.

4. Determine the irrigation acres for each farm within the farm unit. The irrigation acres are the acres in the farm which were legally irrigated at any time during the five years preceding January 1, 1980 for initial active management areas or the date of the notice of the initiation of designation procedures or the call for the election for subsequent active management areas, which are capable of being irrigated and which have not been retired from irrigation for a non-irrigation use pursuant to section 45-463 or 45-469.

5. Multiply the water duty acres for each farm within the farm unit by the irrigation water duty for the farm unit and divide that amount by the number of irrigation acres in the farm. The result shall be the maximum amount of groundwater which may be used per year for the irrigation of each irrigation acre in the farm. If the farm is located in an active management area other than the Santa Cruz active management area and is irrigated solely with groundwater, the amount of groundwater used by the farm for irrigation shall be accounted for pursuant to section 45-467, subsection C. If a farm is located in an active management area other than the Santa Cruz active management area and is irrigated with a combination of surface water and groundwater, the amount of groundwater used by the farm for irrigation shall be accounted for pursuant to section 45-467, subsection D. If a farm is located in the Santa Cruz active management area, the amount of water, other than stored water, withdrawn from a well and used by the farm for irrigation purposes shall be accounted for pursuant to section 45-467, subsection E or F.

C. A person who owns land described in subsection A of this section and whose water use on the land is regulated under a best management practices program that is adopted by the director pursuant to section 45-566.02, subsection F, section 45-567.02, subsection G or section 45-568.02, subsection G:

1. Has the right to use groundwater for an irrigation use on the irrigation acres within that land as those acres are determined pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 4 of this section.

2. Is exempt from the provisions of subsection B of this section with respect to that land.

D. The right to use groundwater pursuant to this section for the irrigation of an irrigation acre is an irrigation grandfathered right and is appurtenant to that acre. An irrigation grandfathered right is owned by the owner of the land to which it is appurtenant and may be leased for an irrigation use with the land to which it is appurtenant.

E. A person who owns or leases irrigation acres may use the total amount of groundwater allowed by the irrigation grandfathered right for such acres for the irrigation of all or a portion of such acres.

F. If the irrigation water duty for the farm unit in which an irrigation acre is located is reduced by the director pursuant to article 9 of this chapter, the amount of groundwater which may be used for the irrigation of such acre pursuant to the irrigation grandfathered right under subsection B of this section is reduced accordingly.

G. For purposes of this chapter, the amount of groundwater which may be used or is used is the amount of groundwater withdrawn by the groundwater user, measured at the point of withdrawal, and the amount of groundwater received by the groundwater user from an irrigation district or other source.

 

#### Section 45-465.01. Flood damaged acres; substitution of acres; definition

A. A person who owns acres of land within an initial active management area which were legally irrigated at any time during the five years preceding January 1, 1980 and which have not been retired from irrigation for a non-irrigation use pursuant to section 45-463 or 45-469 may permanently retire such acres from irrigation and substitute for such acres the same number of acres within the same sub-basin or a contiguous sub-basin of the same initial active management area which were not legally irrigated at any time during the five years preceding January 1, 1980, and has the right to use groundwater for the irrigation of such substitute acres as determined pursuant to section 45-465 calculated on the basis of the acres which were legally irrigated, if the owner demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that all the following apply:

1. The acres which were irrigated during the five years preceding January 1, 1980 were damaged by floodwaters after being irrigated.

2. It is not economically feasible to restore the flood damaged acres to irrigation use.

3. The owner has received a certificate of grandfathered right for an irrigation use for the flood damaged acres.

B. Any acres permanently retired from irrigation pursuant to this section relinquish their irrigation grandfathered rights and such rights are deemed to be appurtenant to the substitute acres.

C. For purposes of this section, "floodwaters" means a temporary and erosive overflow of waters on lands not normally covered by water which occurred after January 1, 1975.

#### Section 45-465.02. Impediments to efficient irrigation; substitution of acres; definitions

A. A person who owns acres of land described on a certificate of irrigation grandfathered right which have not been retired from irrigation for a non-irrigation use under section 45-463 or 45-469 may apply to the director to permanently retire a portion of those acres from irrigation and substitute for those acres the same number of acres to which irrigation grandfathered rights are not appurtenant. The director may approve the substitution of acres if the owner demonstrates to the director's satisfaction that all of the following apply:

1. A limiting condition associated with the acres to be retired from irrigation substantially impedes the implementation of more efficient irrigation practices on the certificated acres.

2. The substitution of acres will substantially reduce the limiting condition and will substantially facilitate the implementation of more efficient irrigation practices.

3. The substitute acres are within the same farm unit as the certificated acres that will not be retired.

4. The substitution will not reduce the number of acres of land within the farm unit that are eligible to receive central Arizona project water.

5. If the acres to be retired are located within the exterior boundaries of an irrigation district, the substitute acres will be located within the exterior boundaries of the same irrigation district.

6. The area of land within the substitute acres that is physically capable of being irrigated at the time the application for substitution of acres is filed does not exceed the area of land within the acres to be retired that is physically capable of being irrigated at the time the application for substitution of acres is filed.

B. Any acres permanently retired from irrigation pursuant to this section relinquish their irrigation grandfathered rights and such rights are deemed to be appurtenant to the substitute acres. The owner or lessee of the substitute acres has the right to use groundwater to irrigate the substitute acres as determined under section 45-465 calculated on the basis of the acres permanently retired from irrigation.

C. If the director approves a substitution of acres under this section, the director may modify an irrigation water duty established for the farm unit in which the certificated acres are located to reflect the removal of the limiting condition that is associated with the retired irrigation acres. The modification may be made without complying with section 45-572. The director shall give written notice of the modification to the owner of the certificated acres within thirty days after the modification. An aggrieved person may request an administrative review pursuant to section 45-575 or a variance pursuant to section 45-574. Unless a variance is obtained under section 45-574, the owner of the certificated acres and the person using groundwater on the certificated acres shall comply with the modified irrigation water duty no later than the compliance date specified in the modification notice which may be less than two years after the date of the notice.

D. For purposes of this section:

1. "Certificated acres" means the acres described on the certificate of irrigation grandfathered right.

2. "Limiting condition" means any condition that limits the achievement of more efficient irrigation on the certificated acres, including irregularly shaped certificated acres and poor quality soils.

#### Section 45-465.03. Right to use groundwater for domestic and stockwatering purposes incidental to irrigation grandfathered right; definitions

A. In an initial active management area, a person who holds a certificate of irrigation grandfathered right has the right to withdraw annually up to ten acre-feet of groundwater for domestic purposes or stockwatering from a well or wells the holder is using to withdraw groundwater for irrigation use on the certificated acres and use the groundwater pursuant to subsections B and C of this section if both of the following apply:

1. As of June 12, 1980 groundwater withdrawn from the well or wells was being used for domestic purposes or stockwatering.

2. No certificate of type 2 non-irrigation grandfathered right has been issued by the director based in whole or in part on the withdrawals for domestic purposes or stockwatering.

B. Groundwater withdrawn pursuant to this section may be used only:

1. On the same land on which groundwater withdrawn from the well or wells was being used for domestic purposes or stockwatering as of June 12, 1980.

2. For the same purpose for which groundwater withdrawn from the well or wells was being used as of June 12, 1980.

C. If groundwater withdrawn pursuant to this section is used for domestic purposes and stockwatering, the aggregate quantity of groundwater withdrawn for those purposes shall not exceed ten acre-feet per year.

D. For purposes of this section, a replacement well in the same location or a replacement well in a new location shall be considered to be the same well as the well being used as of June 12, 1980.

E. If the withdrawals for domestic purposes or stockwatering are separately measured with a water measuring device approved by the director pursuant to section 45-604, the withdrawals are exempt from the conservation requirements for non-irrigation uses established in the management plans adopted pursuant to article 9 of this chapter.

F. If the withdrawals for domestic purposes or stockwatering are not separately measured with a water measuring device approved by the director pursuant to section 45-604, the withdrawals shall be deemed to be withdrawals for irrigation use on the certificated acres for purposes of determining debits and credits to the flexibility account established pursuant to section 45-467 and for purposes of reporting the use to which the groundwater was applied in the annual reports required by section 45-632.

G. The right to withdraw and use groundwater pursuant to this section is an incident of an irrigation grandfathered right and may be leased or conveyed with the irrigation grandfathered right.

H. If an irrigation grandfathered right is retired or conveyed for a non-irrigation use, the right to withdraw and use groundwater pursuant to this section is extinguished.

I. For purposes of this section:

1. "Certificated acres" means the acres described on the certificate of irrigation grandfathered right.

2. "Domestic purposes" means uses related to the supply, service and activities of households and private residences.

A. The use of groundwater to water plants in containers on or above the surface of the ground is a non-irrigation use in an active management area.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, in an initial active management area, a person who holds a certificate of irrigation grandfathered right may withdraw groundwater pursuant to the right and use the groundwater to water plants in containers on or above the surface of the certificated acres if the plants are grown for sale or human consumption or for use as feed for livestock, range livestock or poultry, as those terms are defined in section 3-1201.

C. A person who holds a certificate of irrigation grandfathered right shall separately measure with a measuring device approved by the director pursuant to section 45-604 any groundwater used for watering plants in containers on or above the surface of the certificated acres and any groundwater used for an irrigation use on the certificated acres.

D. Except as provided in section 45-563.02, if a person uses groundwater to water plants in containers pursuant to subsection B of this section, the total amount of water used by the person for that purpose and for any irrigation uses on the certificated acres may not exceed the amount allowed by the irrigation water duty for the farm.

E. The director may not register credits to the flexibility account established pursuant to section 45-467 for a farm in any year in which the person who holds the certificate of irrigation grandfathered right for the farm uses groundwater to water plants in containers on or above the surface of the certificated acres pursuant to subsection B of this section.

F. On request by the owner of a certificate of irrigation grandfathered right, the director shall separate the certificate into two certificates, with one certificate for those certificated acres on which plants in containers are watered with groundwater pursuant to subsection B of this section and one certificate for those certificated acres on which groundwater is used for an irrigation use.  If the director separates a certificate of irrigation grandfathered right into two certificates pursuant to this subsection, the certificated acres associated with each certificate shall be considered a separate farm for purposes of subsection E of this section. The director may not separate a certificate of irrigation grandfathered right into two certificates pursuant to this subsection if it would result in the issuance of a certificate of irrigation grandfathered right with less than two certificated acres.

G. For the purposes of this section, "certificated acres" means the acres described on the certificate of irrigation grandfathered right.

#### Section 45-466. Limitations on use of irrigation water duty; deliveries of water in excess of irrigation water duty

A. The irrigation water duty shall be used to determine the maximum amount of groundwater which may be used pursuant to section 45-465, subsection B and debits and credits to the flexibility account as set forth in section 45-467. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, the irrigation water duty shall not be applied to diminish surface water delivered to lands pursuant to appropriative surface water rights or decreed surface water rights.

H. A farm qualifies under subsection G of this section if it is located in an active management area other than the Santa Cruz active management area and either of the following applies:

1. The amount of groundwater used to irrigate the farm during the accounting period does not exceed an amount computed by multiplying the water duty acres in the farm by one and one-half acre-feet of water, except that an electrical district organized under title 48, chapter 12 or an irrigation district may apply to the director no later than March 31 of a year for an increase in that amount for that year for the farms located within the boundaries of the district that do not qualify under paragraph 2 of this subsection.  The director shall grant the increase if the district demonstrates that it holds a contract for the purchase of hydroelectric power marketed by the western area power administration or the Arizona power authority and that the use of groundwater during that year by all of the farms within the boundaries of the district that do not qualify under paragraph 2 of this subsection in an amount that does not exceed one and one-half acre-feet of water multiplied by the total number of water duty acres of those farms would result in the district being unable to use its hydroelectric power capacity entitlement under the contract. If the director grants the increase, the director shall compute the maximum amount of groundwater that may be used by a farm within the district during the year in order to qualify under subsection G of this section as follows:

(a) Determine the total amount of groundwater that must be used during the year by all farms in the district that do not qualify under paragraph 2 of this subsection to enable the district to efficiently use its hydroelectric kilowatt demand allocation.

(b) Divide the amount determined in subdivision (a) of this paragraph by the total number of water duty acres of the farms in the district that do not qualify under paragraph 2 of this subsection.

(c) Multiply the farm's water duty acres by the quotient in subdivision (b) of this paragraph or two acre-feet of water, whichever is less.

2. The farm is irrigated with water supplied by an irrigation district that owns or leases and operates all of the wells used to withdraw groundwater for irrigation use within the district, and the total amount of groundwater supplied by the irrigation district for irrigation use during the year does not exceed an amount computed by multiplying the total number of water duty acres within the irrigation district by one and one-half acre-feet of water, except that the irrigation district or an electrical district organized under title 48, chapter 12 may apply to the director no later than March 31 of a year for an increase in that amount for that year for the farms located within the boundaries of the irrigation district. The director shall grant the increase if the irrigation district or electrical district demonstrates that it holds a contract for the purchase of hydroelectric power marketed by the western area power administration or the Arizona power authority and that the irrigation district or electrical district would be unable to use its hydroelectric power capacity entitlement under the contract if the total amount of groundwater supplied by the irrigation district for irrigation use during the year does not exceed an amount computed by multiplying the total number of water duty acres within the irrigation district by one and one-half acre-feet of water. If the director grants the increase, the maximum amount of groundwater that may be supplied by the irrigation district for irrigation use during the year in order for the farms located within the boundaries of the irrigation district to qualify under subsection G of this section shall be the lesser of the following:

(a) The amount of groundwater that the director determines must be supplied by the irrigation district for irrigation use during the year to enable the irrigation district or electrical district to efficiently use its hydroelectric kilowatt demand allocation.

(b) An amount of groundwater computed by multiplying the total number of water duty acres within the irrigation district by two acre-feet of water.

I. The maximum excess amount of groundwater that may be used pursuant to this section is equal to fifty per cent of the current irrigation water duty for the farm multiplied by the water duty acres in the farm. An owner of an irrigation grandfathered right and the person using groundwater pursuant to the right violate this section if the flexibility account for the farm in which the irrigation acres to which the right is appurtenant are located is in arrears at any time in excess of this amount. Groundwater equal to the credit balance in the flexibility account may be used at any time.

J. In the Santa Cruz active management area, the maximum excess amount of water, other than stored water, withdrawn from a well that may be used pursuant to this section is equal to fifty per cent of the current irrigation water duty for the farm multiplied by the water duty acres in the farm. A person using water, other than stored water, withdrawn from a well for an irrigation use in the Santa Cruz active management area violates this section if the flexibility account for the farm is in arrears at any time in excess of this amount. Water, other than stored water, withdrawn from a well in an amount equal to the credit balance in the flexibility account may be used at any time, except that if the water is surface water, the amount that may be used shall not exceed the amount allowed by the decreed or appropriative surface water right.

K. If an irrigation grandfathered right is conveyed for an irrigation use pursuant to section 45-472, each acre conveyed shall carry with it a proportional share of any debits or credits in the flexibility account for the farm.  If an irrigation grandfathered right is conveyed for a non-irrigation use pursuant to section 45-472, each acre conveyed shall carry with it a proportional share of any debits in the flexibility account for the farm.

L. A person in an active management area other than the Santa Cruz active management area who is using groundwater pursuant to an irrigation grandfathered right and who is operating under a variance to the irrigation water duty pursuant to section 45-574:

1. May accumulate a maximum debit in an amount equal to fifty per cent of the current irrigation water duty for the farm multiplied by the water duty acres in the farm.

2. Shall accumulate credits pursuant to subsection C or D of this section.

M. A person in the Santa Cruz active management area who is using water, other than stored water, withdrawn from a well for an irrigation use and who is operating under a variance to the irrigation water duty pursuant to section 45-574:

1. May accumulate a maximum debit in an amount equal to fifty per cent of the current irrigation water duty for the farm multiplied by the water duty acres in the farm.

2. Shall accumulate credits pursuant to subsection E or F of this section.

N. In an active management area other than the Santa Cruz active management area, a person using groundwater pursuant to an irrigation grandfathered right shall file a report with the director each year which shall include the amount of groundwater used pursuant to the irrigation grandfathered right and such other information as the director shall require. In the Santa Cruz active management area, a person using water, other than stored water, withdrawn from a well for irrigation use shall file a report with the director each year which shall include the amount of water used on the farm and such other information as the director shall require. The director may consolidate the reporting requirements of this section with the reporting requirements of section 45-632.  A person using groundwater pursuant to an irrigation grandfathered right that is regulated under a best management practices program adopted by the director, pursuant to section 45-566.02, subsection F, section 45-567.02, subsection G or section 45-568.02, subsection F, is exempt from the reporting requirements of this subsection for groundwater used pursuant to the irrigation grandfathered right, except that the person shall file a report with the director each year that includes the information required by the best management practices program.  A person using groundwater pursuant to an irrigation grandfathered right that is appurtenant to ten or fewer irrigation acres is exempt from the reporting requirements of this subsection for groundwater used pursuant to the irrigation grandfathered right unless one of the following applies:

1. The land to which the irrigation grandfathered right is appurtenant is part of an integrated farming operation.

2. Groundwater is withdrawn from the land to which the irrigation grandfathered right is appurtenant and delivered for use pursuant to either a service area right pursuant to article 6 of this chapter or a grandfathered groundwater right other than an irrigation grandfathered right that is appurtenant to irrigation acres that are exempt from irrigation water duties pursuant to section 45-563.02.

3. Groundwater is withdrawn from land that is both owned by the owner of the irrigation grandfathered right and contiguous to the land to which the irrigation grandfathered right is appurtenant and delivered for use pursuant to either a service area right pursuant to article 6 of this chapter or a grandfathered groundwater right other than an irrigation grandfathered right that is appurtenant to irrigation acres that are exempt from irrigation water duties pursuant to section 45-563.02.

O. A person who owns an irrigation grandfathered right that is appurtenant to irrigation acres that were capable of being irrigated as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year and whose farm has registered a credit balance to its flexibility account may convey or sell all or a portion of the credit balance to any person, including the conveyor or seller of the credit balance, who owns another irrigation grandfathered right or who uses groundwater pursuant to another irrigation grandfathered right, except that:

1. A credit balance that is registered to the flexibility account of a farm located within an irrigation district may be transferred only to:

(a) The flexibility account of a farm that is located within the same irrigation district.

(b) The flexibility account of a farm that is located outside of that irrigation district if both farms are located in the same groundwater subbasin and the same active management area and if the farm to which the credits are conveyed is owned or leased by the owner or lessee of the farm from which the credits are conveyed.

2. A credit balance that is registered to the flexibility account of a farm that is not located within an irrigation district may be transferred only to:

(a) The flexibility account of a farm that is located within the same groundwater subbasin and the same active management area and that is not located within an irrigation district.

(b) The flexibility account of a farm that is located within the same groundwater subbasin and the same active management area and that is located within an irrigation district if the farm to which the credits are conveyed is owned or leased by the owner or lessee of the farm from which the credits are conveyed.

3. A credit registered to a flexibility account for a year may be conveyed or sold only during the second calendar year following the year for which the credit was registered.

4. A person who owns a farm that includes protected farmland may not sell or otherwise convey any credit registered to the farm's flexibility account.

P. A person who sells or conveys all or a portion of a credit balance pursuant to subsection O of this section, and the person to whom the credit balance is sold or conveyed, shall notify the director of the sale or conveyance within thirty days after the sale or conveyance on a form prescribed and furnished by the director.

Q. The director shall establish and collect a reasonable fee from the conveyee or purchaser of a credit balance pursuant to subsection O of this section to cover the cost of administrative services and other expenses associated with registering a deduction to the conveyor's or seller's flexibility account balance and an addition to the conveyee's or purchaser's flexibility account balance pursuant to subsection R of this section. The conveyee or purchaser shall pay the fee at the time the notice required pursuant to subsection P of this section is given to the director.  The director shall deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, all fees received under this subsection in the water resources fund established by section 45-117.

R. A sale or conveyance of all or part of a credit balance under subsection O of this section is effective only if the director receives the notice required by subsection P of this section and the fee required by subsection Q of this section within thirty days after the sale or conveyance. After receiving the notice and the fee, the director shall register a deduction of the credit amount conveyed or sold from the conveyor's or seller's flexibility account balance and the corresponding addition to the conveyee's or purchaser's flexibility account balance. The deduction and addition to the flexibility account balances are effective as of the date of the sale or conveyance.

S. The director shall report to the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives no later than June 30, 2002 on the effect of conveyances of flexibility account credit balances pursuant to subsection O, paragraph 2 of this section on the achievement of the management goal of each active management area as stated in section 45-562 and on the conservation program included in the management plan for each active management area as provided in section 45-565, and any recommended changes to subsection O, paragraph 2 of this section.

T. Except for subsection N of this section, this section does not apply to:

1. A farm if the person entitled to use groundwater on the farm is exempt from the irrigation water duties established for the farm as provided in section 45-563.02, subsection A or if the director may not establish irrigation water duties for the farm as provided in section 45-563.02, subsection B.

2. A farm if water use within the farm is regulated under a best management practices program adopted by the director pursuant to section 45-566.02, subsection F, section 45-567.02, subsection G or section 45-568.02, subsection F.

 

#### Section 45-468. Accounting of water by persons delivering a combination of surface water and groundwater for irrigation uses

A. A person delivering a combination of surface water or effluent, or both, and groundwater for irrigation uses shall prior to the beginning of each accounting period estimate the amount of groundwater that will be withdrawn and delivered during the next accounting period and shall make such estimate available to the director. The estimate may be modified from time to time as conditions warrant.

B. Within ninety days following the end of each accounting period a person who delivers a combination of surface water or effluent, or both, and groundwater for uses by cities, towns, private water companies, industries, farms or other users shall provide the director with an accounting for water during the past accounting period which shows the following:

1. All surface water provided to each class of user and each farm.

2. All groundwater provided to each class of user and each farm.

3. All effluent provided to each class of user and each farm.

C. If a person delivers water to a user through a delivery system that commingles groundwater with surface water or effluent, or both, the amount of groundwater charged to the user pursuant to the accounting in subsection B shall be computed as follows:

1. Determine the total amount of water delivered to the user through the system during the accounting period.

2. Determine the amount of surface water and effluent that would have been delivered to the user through the system during the accounting period if no groundwater had been delivered through the system.

3. Subtract the amount determined pursuant to paragraph 2 from the amount determined pursuant to paragraph 1.

#### Section 45-469. Right to retire irrigation grandfathered right for non-irrigation use; development plan approval; amendment of plan; approval of plan prior to retirement; amount withdrawn; service area determined; restoration of retired irrigation grandfathered right

A. Except as provided in section 45-480, subsection F and subsection P of this section, except as provided in subsection I of this section, a person who owns land that is legally entitled to be irrigated with groundwater pursuant to an irrigation grandfathered right and that is located within an active management area and outside of the exterior boundaries of the service area of a city, town or private water company has the right to retire such land from irrigation in anticipation of a future non-irrigation use and shall not forfeit or abandon the right to withdraw from or receive for such land the amount of groundwater calculated pursuant to subsection F of this section for a non-irrigation use if all of the following apply:

1. The land is held in the same ownership.

2. A development plan for the proposed non-irrigation use exists and is approved by the director within a reasonable time before or after the land is retired.

3. Either one of the following applies:

(a) The land has never been designated by the director as protected farmland pursuant to section 45-483, subsection A.

(b) The director designated the land as protected farmland pursuant to section 45-483, subsection A, the director subsequently revoked the designation pursuant to section 45-483, subsection C, paragraph 1 and the director determined at the time the designation was revoked that the conservation easement in the land was terminated because a partial or full condemnation of the land made farming impracticable.

B. Except as provided in subsection P of this section, the director shall approve the development plan required by subsection A of this section if it appears that the land:

1. Has been or will be retired for the bona fide purpose of conserving or using water for a non-irrigation use that would otherwise continue to be used for irrigation of such land.

2. Has not been sold or taken out of production primarily because it would have been uneconomical to continue to withdraw water for irrigation.

C. The director shall not investigate the legality, other than pursuant to this chapter, feasibility or other factors involved in the proposed development plan and shall not disapprove a development plan on such grounds.

D. A development plan may be amended and the director shall approve amendments if the criteria of this section are met.

E. A person proposing to retire irrigated land that is located inside or outside of an active management area may apply to the director for approval of a proposed development plan prior to the retirement of such land.

F. The amount of groundwater that may be withdrawn or received annually per acre pursuant to this section is the lesser of:

1. The current maximum amount of groundwater that may be used pursuant to the irrigation grandfathered right for the acre at the time it is retired, as calculated pursuant to section 45-465, subsection B.

2. Three acre-feet multiplied by the water duty acres in the farm in which the acre to which the right is appurtenant is located divided by the number of irrigation acres in the farm.

G. The right to withdraw or receive groundwater pursuant to this section is a non-irrigation grandfathered right associated with retired irrigated land, or a type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right as described in section 45-463.

H. Whether the land to which an irrigation grandfathered right is appurtenant is within the exterior boundaries of the service area of a city, town or private water company shall be determined as of the date the development plan is filed with the director.

I. A city or town in an initial active management area that holds a certificate of irrigation grandfathered right for acres of land that were acquired before January 1, 1989 in another initial active management area, and a groundwater replenishment district established under title 48, chapter 27 that purchases any of that land from the city or town, has the right, subject to subsections J, K, L and M of this section, to retire the land in anticipation of a future non-irrigation use and withdraw from any location on the land groundwater for non-irrigation use on the land or for transportation to another initial active management area for the purpose of demonstrating and providing an assured water supply if all of the following apply:

1. Before January 1, 1989, the city or town filed with the director a development plan pursuant to this section for all or a portion of the land.

2. Any withdrawals pursuant to this subsection from a new well, as defined in section 45-591, will comply with the rules adopted pursuant to section 45-598, subsection A to prevent unreasonably increasing damage to surrounding land or other water users from the concentration of wells.

3. Any withdrawals for transportation to another initial active management area for the purpose of demonstrating and providing an assured water supply are made from a depth to one thousand two hundred feet at the site or sites of the withdrawals, except that the wells may be drilled to any depth.

J. The amount of groundwater that may be withdrawn and used annually pursuant to subsection I of this section shall be determined pursuant to subsection F of this section. The maximum amount of such groundwater that may be included by the director in determining whether to designate or redesignate the city or town as having an assured water supply pursuant to section 45-576 equals one hundred times the total amount that may be withdrawn annually from the land.

K. A city or town that is eligible for a type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right under subsection I of this section may:

1. Before retiring the land under subsection I of this section, substitute for the acres of land described in subsection I of this section the same number of acres owned by the city or town to which irrigation grandfathered rights are appurtenant and located in the same subbasin as the acres described in subsection I of this section.

2. At any time, elect to convert a type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right appurtenant to land in the same subbasin and acquired by the city or town before January 1, 1989 under subsection A of this section to a type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right under subsection I of this section.

L. In determining whether to designate or redesignate the city or town as having an assured water supply pursuant to section 45-576, based in whole or in part on groundwater transported from the active management area under subsection I of this section, the director shall include the amount of groundwater that may be included under subsection J of this section and can be withdrawn from a depth to one thousand two hundred feet at the site or sites of the proposed withdrawals at a rate that, when added to the existing rate of withdrawals in the area, is not expected to cause the groundwater table at the site or sites of the proposed withdrawals to decline more than an average of ten feet per year during the one hundred year evaluation period.

M. In any designation or redesignation of an assured water supply pursuant to section 45-576, the projected use of the groundwater that is demonstrated to be available for assured water supply purposes under subsection L of this section is deemed to be consistent with achieving the management goal for the active management area. In any such designation or redesignation, the director shall determine whether the projected use is consistent with the management plan for the active management area by determining whether the projected use is consistent with the management plan of the active management area in which the city or town to be designated or redesignated is located.

N. Subsections A, B and H of this section do not apply to type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered rights acquired under subsection I of this section.

O. The director may restore retired irrigation grandfathered rights to land that was retired from irrigation under this section according to the following conditions and procedures:

1. Title to the retired land has reverted involuntarily, or voluntarily in lieu of foreclosure or forfeiture, from the person who retired it from irrigation, or a successor in title, to a previous owner.

2. The current owner of the retired land must apply to the director in writing stating:

(b) The circumstances regarding the reversion of title to the current owner.

(c) Why restoring the irrigation grandfathered rights is necessary.

3. The director shall enter the application in the registry under section 45-479 and review the application. An administrative hearing shall be held in the active management area in which the use is located on whether to restore the irrigation grandfathered rights to the land.

4. The director must find that restoring the irrigation grandfathered rights:

(a) Will not adversely impact the management of the active management area.

(b) Is necessary to prevent unreasonable hardship to the current owner of the retired land.

5. If the director decides to restore the retired irrigation grandfathered rights to the land:

(a) The retired irrigation land regains its original irrigation grandfathered rights, with the debits and credits in its flexibility account at the time of retirement.

(b) The type 1 non-irrigation grandfathered right under this section is terminated.

(c) The development plan required by this section is terminated for purposes of this section.

P. Beginning January 1 of the calendar year following the year in which a groundwater replenishment district is required to submit its preliminary plan pursuant to section 45-576.02, subsection A, paragraph 1, the director shall withhold approval of a development plan that is submitted under this section by a person who seeks to obtain a non-irrigation grandfathered right associated with retired irrigated land located in the district unless at the time the plan is submitted:

1. The director has determined that the district's plan for operation is consistent with achieving the management goal, according to section 45-576.03, subsection E, and the designation has not expired.

2. The master replenishment account, as established in section 45-858.01, does not have a debit balance in an amount in excess of the amount allowed under section 45-576.01, subsection A, paragraph 3.

Dewatering does not include process water and tailing water recovered from or pumped from beneath tailing ponds.

B. A person who is engaged in or proposes to engage in the extraction and processing of minerals may recover from or pump from beneath tailing ponds process water and tailing water without obtaining a permit under this article, if that water is recycled into the extraction or metallurgical process or is withdrawn to comply with applicable environmental controls. Such a person may not drill or cause to be drilled a well for the purpose of pumping or recovering process water or tailing water from beneath tailing ponds for recycling into the extraction or metallurgical process without first filing a notice of intention to drill under section 45-596.

C. Groundwater withdrawn pursuant to a dewatering permit shall be used in the following order of priority:

1. To meet mineral extraction, metallurgical processing and environmental control requirements of the permittee.

2. To a city, town, private water company or farm and any other person whose respective ability to withdraw groundwater has been adversely affected by a dewatering permit. Such water shall be equitably allocated by the director without costs but subject to the conditions set forth in subsection D of this section among such persons adversely affected by such dewatering. A person who receives an allocation of water under this paragraph shall reduce his groundwater withdrawals by the amount of water he receives under this paragraph. A person receiving water under this paragraph does not thereby forfeit or abandon his right to withdraw groundwater.

3. For municipal, commercial, domestic and industrial needs of communities and residential areas directly related to the mineral extraction and metallurgical processing operation of the permittee.

4. To irrigate land owned or controlled by the permittee which is entitled to the use of groundwater for irrigation.

5. To the director for such distribution as will best achieve the goals and purposes of the management plan for the active management area.

6. For such other legal purpose as the permittee elects.

D. Groundwater made available to the director for distribution or allocation under this section is subject to the following conditions:

1. The permittee shall deliver the groundwater to the boundary of his property but shall not be obligated to deliver it further.

2. The permittee shall not be required to treat the chemical quality of the groundwater for distribution or allocation.

3. The permittee shall not be required to make the groundwater available if dewatering ceases, or if all or any portion of the groundwater is needed for a purpose having a higher priority as specified in subsection C of this section.

4. The person actually using the groundwater distributed or allocated by the director shall be responsible for paying any withdrawal fees required under section 45-611.

3. Irrigation grandfathered rights appurtenant to acres of land in reasonable proximity to the intended general industrial use are not available for purchase at a reasonable price or cannot be acquired by eminent domain and the applicant does not own or lease grandfathered rights that the applicant is not using or leasing, that may be used for the intended general industrial use and that can be used for the intended general industrial use without imposing an unreasonable economic burden on the applicant.

4. The intended general industrial use, if located within three miles of the exterior boundaries of the service area of a city, town or private water company, has been denied service by the city, town or private water company at the customary rate in the customary manner. The requirement of this paragraph does not apply to an expanded animal industry use.

5. The management plan for the active management area can be adjusted to accommodate the intended general industrial use consistent with the achievement of the management goal for the active management area.

6. There is an assured water supply for the intended use at the intended point of withdrawal. The director may waive this requirement if the director is unable to determine if there is an assured water supply because of hydrogeologic conditions underlying the point of withdrawal. For purposes of this section, "assured water supply" means that sufficient groundwater of adequate quality will be available to the applicant to satisfy the projected general industrial use for the duration of the permit.

B. Title to land in the Butler Valley groundwater basin that is owned by this state or a political subdivision of this state and from which groundwater is withdrawn for transportation to an initial active management area may be sold, exchanged or otherwise conveyed only to this state or to another political subdivision of this state.

#### Section 45-554. Transportation of groundwater withdrawn in Harquahala irrigation non-expansion area to an initial active management area

A. A groundwater replenishment district established under title 48, chapter 27 may lease from an irrigation district located entirely within the Harquahala irrigation non-expansion area the use of one or more of the wells in the irrigation district to withdraw the groundwater that can be withdrawn from a depth to one thousand feet, at a rate that, when added to the existing rates of withdrawal in the area, does not cause the groundwater table at the site or sites to decline more than ten feet per year, for transportation to an initial active management area. The lease payments shall be made to the members of the irrigation district on a pro rata basis, per acre of land that is eligible to be irrigated under section 45-437, subsection B, minus the irrigation district's administrative costs. Wells leased under this subsection are exempt from well spacing requirements under section 45-559.

B. This state or a political subdivision of this state that owns land eligible to be irrigated under section 45-437, subsection B in the Harquahala irrigation non-expansion area may withdraw groundwater from the land for transportation to an initial active management area for its own use or use by the Arizona water banking authority pursuant to section 45-2491 only:

1. If the groundwater is withdrawn:

(a) From a depth to one thousand feet at the site or sites of the proposed withdrawals.

(b) At a rate that, when added to the existing rate of withdrawals in the area, does not cause the groundwater table at the site or sites of the withdrawals to decline more than an average of ten feet per year during the one hundred year evaluation period.

2. In an amount either:

(a) Per acre of the eligible land, not to exceed:

(i) Six acre-feet in any year.

(ii) Thirty acre-feet for any period of ten consecutive years computed in continuing progressive series beginning in the year transportation of groundwater from the land begins.

(b) Established by the director, but only if the director determines that withdrawals in an amount greater than that permitted by subdivision (a) of this paragraph will not unreasonably increase damage to residents of surrounding land and other water users in the irrigation non-expansion area, or that one or more of the entities withdrawing the groundwater will mitigate the damage to the residents and other water users.

C. If this state or one or more political subdivisions of this state own eighty per cent or more of the land that is eligible to be irrigated under section 45-437, subsection B in the irrigation non-expansion area, each of the entities may withdraw groundwater from the eligible land it owns for transportation to an initial active management area:

1. From a depth to one thousand feet at the site or sites of withdrawals.

2. From a depth between one thousand and one thousand two hundred feet at the site or sites of the withdrawals only if the director determines either that the withdrawals will not unreasonably increase damage to residents of surrounding land or that one or more of the entities withdrawing the groundwater will mitigate the damage to the residents.

 

#### Section 45-555. Transportation of groundwater withdrawn in Big Chino sub-basin of the Verde River groundwater basin to initial active management area; exception

A. A city or town that owns land consisting of historically irrigated acres in the Big Chino sub-basin of the Verde River groundwater basin, as designated by order of the director dated June 21, 1984, or a city or town with the consent of the landowner, may withdraw from the land for transportation to an adjacent initial active management area an amount of groundwater determined pursuant to this section. The amount of groundwater that may be withdrawn from the land pursuant to this section shall not exceed:

1. In any year two times the annual transportation allotment for the land determined pursuant to subsection B.

2. For any period of ten consecutive years computed in continuing progressive series beginning in the year transportation of groundwater from the land begins, ten times the annual transportation allotment for the land.

B. The director shall determine the annual transportation allotment as follows:

1. Determine each farm or portion of a farm owned or leased by the city or town in the sub-basin.

2. For each such farm or portion of a farm, determine the historically irrigated acres retired from irrigation. Multiply the sum of those historically irrigated acres by three acre-feet per acre.

C. In making the determination required by subsection B, the director shall rely only on credible documentary evidence submitted by the city or town or otherwise obtained by the department.

D. For the purposes of subsections A, B and C:

1. "Documentary evidence" means correspondence, contracts, other agreements, aerial photography, affidavits, receipts or official records.

2. "Farm" means an area of land in the sub-basin that is or was served by a common irrigation water distribution system.

3. "Historically irrigated acres" means acres of land overlying an aquifer that were irrigated with groundwater at any time between January 1, 1975 and January 1, 1990.

E. A city or town in the Prescott active management area may withdraw and transport eight thousand sixty-eight acre-feet per year of groundwater from the Big Chino sub-basin of the Verde River groundwater basin to the Prescott active management area if the city or town does both of the following:

1. Relinquishes a supply of water from the central Arizona project allocated to the city or town.

2. Enters into a federally-approved settlement of the water rights claims of an Indian tribe in the Prescott active management area.

F. Notwithstanding the volume limitation in subsection E, in any year in which a city or town that qualifies under subsection E delivers more than two hundred thirty-one acre-feet of water to an Indian tribe for use on its reservation in the Prescott active management area pursuant to a federally-approved Indian water rights settlement, the city or town may withdraw and transport additional groundwater from the Big Chino sub-basin to the Prescott active management area in an amount equal to the amount by which those deliveries exceed two hundred thirty-one acre-feet.

G. Groundwater that is withdrawn and transported pursuant to subsections E and F may be delivered to and used by any city, town or Indian tribe in the Prescott active management area without regard to whether that entity withdraws and transports the water.

 

#### Section 45-556. Transportation fee; annual adjustment; credits; enforcement

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, a person who directly or indirectly transports groundwater, withdrawn in a groundwater basin or sub-basin as provided by this article or in the Pinal active management area, away from the county in which it was withdrawn to an initial active management area shall pay annually to the county a groundwater transportation fee determined by the director for each acre-foot of groundwater transported directly or indirectly away from the county, less any amount of central Arizona project water actually used on the property from which the groundwater is transported.

B. A person is not required to pay a transportation fee under this section for stored water withdrawn pursuant to recovery well permits issued by the director pursuant to this title.

C. Except as provided in subsection D of this section the director shall set the fee as follows for the cumulative amount of groundwater transported away from the county, less any amount of central Arizona project water actually used on the property from which the groundwater is transported:

Net Groundwater Transported   Fee Per Acre-Foot

0 - 1,000,000 acre-feet     $ 3.00

1,000,001 - 2,000,000 acre-feet     $ 5.00

2,000,001 - 3,000,000 acre-feet     $ 7.50

3,000,001 - 4,000,000 acre-feet     $10.00

4,000,001 - 5,000,000 acre-feet     $15.00

Over 5,000,000 acre-feet     $30.00

D. The director shall annually adjust the dollar amount of the fee according to the annual changes in the GDP price deflator, as defined in section 41-563, using the 1993 calendar year as the base year. The director shall immediately notify all concerned parties of the fee adjustments under this subsection.

E. Credits are allowed against the fees imposed by this section as described and in the amounts provided under this subsection. If the amount of the credit exceeds the amount of the fee imposed for any year, the unused portion of the credit may be carried forward and applied to subsequent years' fees until the amount of the credit is exhausted. The allowable credits are as follows:

1. The amount of any increase in property tax revenues, including contributions in lieu of property taxes under title 9, chapter 4, article 3, derived from remote municipal property, as defined in section 42-15251, from which the groundwater is withdrawn. The credit shall account for increased revenues due to improvements to the property and increased revenues due to higher property tax valuations and assessment ratios resulting from changes in use of the property. The credit shall not account for increased revenues due to normal market or economic factors. The amount of the credit for any year is the sum of the amounts computed under subdivisions (a) and (b) as follows:

(a) Delete from consideration under this subdivision any property with respect to which an amount is computed under subdivision (b). Subtract the amount of property tax or in lieu revenues that would have been derived from the remaining property during the immediately preceding tax year if the use of and improvements to the property had remained unchanged since the date the city or town acquired the property from the amount of property tax or in lieu revenues actually derived from that property during the immediately preceding tax year. If a city or town conveys all or part of its interest in remote municipal property to another political subdivision, the political subdivision succeeds to the credit allowed under this section. The amount of credit computed under this subdivision shall be computed each year, beginning in the year groundwater is first transported, and, if not used to offset the fee under this section, shall be cumulated from year to year.

(b) This subdivision applies with respect to any portion of the remote municipal property that, before January 1, 1992, was classified at that time as class four property for purposes of property taxation under title 42 but was developed or improved at any time after December 31, 1991 and is not currently classified as class two property. Subtract the amount of property tax or in lieu revenues that would have been derived from that developed or improved portion of the remote municipal property during the immediately preceding tax year if the use of and improvements to the property had remained unchanged since the date the city or town acquired the property from the amount of property tax or in lieu revenues actually derived from that portion of the property during the immediately preceding tax year. If a city or town conveys all or part of its interest in remote municipal property to another political subdivision, the political subdivision succeeds to the credit allowed under this section. The amount of credit computed under this subdivision shall be computed each year, beginning in the year that the property is developed or improved and reclassified for tax purposes, and, if not used to offset the fee under this section, shall be cumulated from year to year.

2. An amount equal to the market value of land donated to the county if the county agrees in writing to prohibit or limit the withdrawal of groundwater from the land. The amount of the credit shall account for the reduced value of the land due to the groundwater withdrawal limitations.

3. An amount agreed to by intergovernmental agreement between the county in which the groundwater is withdrawn and the city, town or other person transporting the groundwater.

F. The board of supervisors of a county to which fees are due and payable under this section may request the county attorney to commence and prosecute any action or proceeding to enforce the collection of the fees.

#### Section 45-557. Requirements for transporting groundwater to an initial active management area; exception

A. Except as provided in subsections B and C of this section:

1. The director shall not consider groundwater that is being or will be withdrawn in a groundwater basin or sub-basin pursuant to this article or the Pinal active management area and transported to an initial active management area for purposes of determining or providing an assured water supply pursuant to section 45-576 if the groundwater is being or will be used by a city, town or private water company that was offered but did not sign a central Arizona project water delivery subcontract.

2. A city, town or private water company that has signed a central Arizona project water delivery subcontract may not use groundwater withdrawn in a groundwater basin or sub-basin pursuant to this article or the Pinal active management area and transported to an initial active management area until it has both:

(a) Demonstrated that it has the physical capacity, including the water treatment plant and delivery system, to accept delivery of ninety-five per cent of its central Arizona project water entitlement under its central Arizona project water delivery subcontract.

(b) Accepted delivery of or exchanged eighty per cent or more of the central Arizona project water available to it under its central Arizona project water delivery subcontract in at least one of the three years immediately preceding the year it intends to begin using groundwater transported away from a groundwater basin or sub-basin pursuant to this article or the Pinal active management area.

B. Subsection A of this section does not apply to groundwater withdrawn in the Big Chino sub-basin of the Verde river groundwater basin and transported to an adjoining initial active management area pursuant to section 45-555.

C. Groundwater transported to an adjoining initial active management area pursuant to section 45-555, subsections E and F shall be deemed to be legally available under the rules adopted pursuant to section 45-576.

 

#### Section 45-558. Weeds and dust

A person shall maintain property owned by the person and from which groundwater is or will be transported pursuant to this article free of noxious weeds as defined in section 3-201, Russian thistles (salsola kali) and blowing dust that creates a threat to health or safety.

#### Section 45-559. Well spacing requirements for withdrawing groundwater for transportation to an active management area

Except as provided in section 45-554, subsection A and except for groundwater withdrawn and transported pursuant to section 45-555, subsections E and F, a person may not use a well constructed after September 21, 1991 for the purpose of withdrawing groundwater for transportation to an active management area pursuant to article 8.1 of this chapter unless the person wishing to use the well for that purpose applies to the director for approval and the director approves the application. The director shall approve the application if the director determines that the withdrawals for that purpose will not unreasonably increase damage to surrounding land or other water users from the concentration of wells. In making this determination, the director shall follow the criteria for proposed withdrawals in the rules adopted pursuant to section 45-598, subsection A.

12. "Safe-yield" means a groundwater management goal which attempts to achieve and thereafter maintain a long-term balance between the annual amount of groundwater withdrawn in an active management area and the annual amount of natural and artificial recharge in the active management area.

13. "Small municipal provider" means a municipal provider that supplies two hundred fifty acre-feet or less of water for non-irrigation use during a calendar year. For purposes of this paragraph, the amount of untreated water that is supplied by a large untreated water provider during a year shall not be counted in determining whether the municipal provider supplied two hundred fifty acre-feet or less of water for non-irrigation use.

14. "Untreated water" means water that is not treated to improve its quality and that is supplied by a municipal provider through a distribution system other than a potable water distribution system.

#### Section 45-562. Management goals for active management areas

A. The management goal of the Tucson, Phoenix and Prescott active management areas is safe-yield by January 1, 2025, or such earlier date as may be determined by the director.

B. The management goal of the Pinal active management area is to allow development of non-irrigation uses as provided in this chapter and to preserve existing agricultural economies in the active management area for as long as feasible, consistent with the necessity to preserve future water supplies for non-irrigation uses.

C. The management goal of the Santa Cruz active management area is to maintain a safe-yield condition in the active management area and to prevent local water tables from experiencing long-term declines.

D. Except as otherwise provided for the Santa Cruz active management area, all initial active management areas are subject to all provisions of this chapter.

A person who obtains a variance under section 45-574 shall comply with the applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements by the date specified in the variance and shall remain in compliance until the compliance date for any applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements established in the management plan for the second management period.

D. A municipal provider which distributes groundwater to an individual user for which an intermediate municipal conservation requirement has been established pursuant to section 45-565, subsection D is not responsible or accountable pursuant to the first management plan for a failure by the individual user to comply with the intermediate conservation requirement occurring on or after the compliance date for the intermediate conservation requirement.

E. In addition to the provisions of the management plan for the first management period prescribed by subsection A of this section, the director may include a program for the augmentation of the water supply of the Tucson active management area including incentives for artificial groundwater recharge.

#### Section 45-565. Management plan for second management period; guidelines

A. For the second management period, 1990 to 2000, the director shall promulgate a management plan for each initial active management area not later than January 1, 1988. In each plan the director shall:

1. Except as provided in section 45-411.01, subsection A, establish a new irrigation water duty for each farm unit to be reached by the end of the second management period and may establish one or more intermediate water duties to be reached at specified intervals during the second management period. Except as provided in subsection G of this section, the irrigation water duty and any intermediate water duties shall be calculated as the quantity of water reasonably required to irrigate the crops historically grown in the farm unit and shall assume the maximum conservation consistent with prudent long-term farm management practices within areas of similar farming conditions, considering the time required to amortize conservation investments and financing costs.

2. Establish additional conservation requirements for all non-irrigation uses of groundwater to be achieved by the end of the second management period and may establish intermediate conservation requirements to be achieved at specified intervals during the second management period. For municipal uses, except as provided in section 45-565.01 and paragraphs 3 and 4 of this subsection, the program shall require additional reasonable reductions in per capita use to those required in the first management period and use of such other conservation measures as may be appropriate for individual users. For industrial uses including industrial uses within the exterior boundaries of the service area of a city, town, private water company or irrigation district, the program shall require the use of or establish conservation requirements based on the use of the latest commercially available conservation technology consistent with reasonable economic return.

3. Establish conservation or rate of use requirements for deliveries of untreated water by large untreated water providers based on the use of the latest commercially available conservation technology consistent with reasonable economic return.

4. Establish reasonable conservation requirements for small municipal providers.

5. Except as provided in section 45-411.01, subsection B, establish additional economically reasonable conservation requirements for the distribution of groundwater by cities, towns, private water companies and irrigation districts within their service areas.

6. Include a program for augmentation of the water supply of the active management area including incentives for artificial groundwater recharge.

7. In cooperation with the department of environmental quality, include an assessment of groundwater quality in the active management area and any proposed program for groundwater quality protection.

B. Within thirty days after the management plan for the second management period is adopted, the director shall give written notice of:

1. The irrigation water duties and conservation requirements in the manner and to the persons prescribed in section 45-564, subsection B, except that the director shall give written notice of any municipal conservation requirement which is substantially identical to an industrial conservation requirement only to the individual users to which the municipal conservation requirement applies, and which have been identified as such by the municipal provider on a form provided by the department and received by the director no later than ninety days before the adoption of the management plan. If the municipal conservation requirement for the use of appropriate conservation measures by individual users is not substantially identical to an industrial conservation requirement, or if the director has not been notified of an individual user by a municipal provider, the director shall give written notice of a municipal conservation requirement to either the individual user or a municipal provider that directly serves the individual user.

2. The conservation requirements for small municipal providers to each small municipal provider in the active management area.

C. Two years before the compliance date specified in the management plan for any irrigation water duty, intermediate water duty, conservation requirement or intermediate conservation requirement, the director shall give additional written notice by first class mail to the last known addresses of the persons prescribed in subsection B of this section, except as provided in subsection D of this section.

D. If the director establishes in the management plan an intermediate municipal conservation requirement that subjects an individual user to a water allotment or application rate identical to the annual water allotment or application rate computed for the individual user under a conservation requirement for the use of appropriate conservation measures adopted in the management plan for the first management period, the compliance date for the intermediate conservation requirement may be two years or less from the date of adoption of the management plan for the second management period and no additional written notice to the individual user is required.

E. Except for a person who obtains a variance under section 45-574 or who is exempt from irrigation water duties under section 45-563.02, subsection A, all persons notified pursuant to subsection B of this section shall comply with the applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements for the second management period not later than January 1, 2000 and shall remain in compliance until the compliance date for any applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements established in the management plan for the third management period. If intermediate water duties or intermediate conservation requirements have been established, a person to whom those water duties or conservation requirements apply shall comply with the intermediate water duties or conservation requirements not later than the compliance date specified in the management plan, unless the person obtains a variance pursuant to section 45-574 or is exempt from intermediate water duties pursuant to section 45-563.02, subsection A. A person who obtains a variance under section 45-574 shall comply with the applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements by the date specified in the variance and shall remain in compliance until the subsequent compliance date for any applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements established in the management plan for the second management period or, if that management plan does not establish any applicable subsequent compliance date, until the applicable compliance date established in the management plan for the third management period.

F. In addition to the provisions of the management plan for the second management period prescribed by subsection A of this section, the director shall:

1. Include a program for conservation assistance to water users within the active management area.

2. Establish the historic annual net natural recharge for any groundwater replenishment district in the active management area, computed by determining the net natural recharge, as defined by section 48-4401, for the groundwater basin beneath the district during calendar years 1961 through 1990 and dividing the result by thirty.

G. A person who is entitled to use groundwater pursuant to an irrigation grandfathered right may apply to the director at any time during the management period for an exemption from the irrigation water duties established under subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section. The director shall grant the exemption if the person demonstrates to the director's satisfaction that granting the exemption is consistent with achieving the management goal of the active management area and that one of the following applies:

1. Withdrawal of groundwater pursuant to the irrigation grandfathered right during the management period will intercept groundwater that would otherwise flow out of and be lost to the active management area within the next fifteen years without entering another active management area.

2. Withdrawal of groundwater pursuant to the irrigation grandfathered right during the management period will prevent encroachment of a rising depth to groundwater level that will cause waterlogging problems within the next fifteen years.

5. Any other information that the director may require.

E. The director shall approve a municipal provider's application for a non-per capita conservation program established under this section only if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. The municipal provider agrees in writing to implement specific conservation programs that will result in achieving water use efficiency in the municipal provider's service area equivalent to the water use efficiency that was assumed by the director in establishing the municipal provider's per capita conservation requirements pursuant to section 45-565, subsection A, paragraph 2, including the programs described in subsection A of this section.

2. If the municipal provider is applying for the program under subsection C, paragraph 3 of this section, the municipal provider has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director that it will reduce the proportion of mined groundwater supplied by it for use within its service area to the proportions described in subsection C, paragraph 3, subdivision (a) of this section, and that it will not deliver mined groundwater for use within its service area after January 1, 2010.

3. If the municipal provider is applying for the program under subsection C, paragraph 5 of this section, the director has made a preliminary determination that the municipal provider's projected groundwater use is consistent with achieving the management goal of the active management area under the criteria contained in rules adopted by the director pursuant to section 45-576. A preliminary determination for purposes of this paragraph is not binding on the director at the time the director determines whether to designate the municipal provider as having an assured water supply.

4. If the municipal provider is applying for the program under subsection C, paragraph 6 of this section, the director has made a preliminary determination that if the municipal provider was applying to the director to be designated as having an assured water supply under rules adopted by the director pursuant to section 45-576, the municipal provider's projected groundwater use would be found to be consistent with achieving the management goal of the active management area under those rules. A preliminary determination of the director for purposes of this paragraph is not binding on the director at the time the director determines whether to designate the municipal provider as having an assured water supply.

G. The director shall include in a non-per capita conservation program established under this section:

1. A requirement that a municipal provider that applied for the program under subsection C, paragraph 3 of this section shall reduce the proportion of mined groundwater supplied by it for use within its service area to the proportions described in subsection C, paragraph 3, subdivision (a) of this section. The director may excuse a municipal provider's failure to comply with the requirement during any year if the municipal provider demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that the municipal provider's failure to comply with the requirement was due to drought conditions or the failure of a surface water distribution system.

2. A requirement that a municipal provider that applied for the program under subsection C, paragraph 4 or 5 of this section shall not supply groundwater for use within its service area in an amount that exceeds that amount of groundwater that the municipal provider may supply for use within its service area consistent with rules adopted by the director pursuant to section 45-576. For purposes of this requirement, if a municipal provider has applied to the director to be designated as having an assured water supply under rules adopted by the director pursuant to section 45-576 and the application is not approved, the amount of groundwater that the municipal provider may supply for use within its service area consistent with the rules is the amount of groundwater that the director determines the municipal provider would have been allowed to supply consistent with the rules if the application had been granted.

H. A municipal provider that applies for a non-per capita conservation program under this section shall comply with the per capita conservation requirements established under section 45-565, subsection A, paragraph 2 until the director approves the application. If the municipal provider's application for the non-per capita conservation program is approved by the director, the provider is exempt from the per capita conservation requirements prescribed under section 45-565, subsection A, paragraph 2.

#### Section 45-566. Management plan for third management period; guidelines

A. For the third management period, 2000 to 2010, the director shall promulgate a management plan for each initial active management area not later than January 1, 1998. The director:

1. Except as provided in section 45-411.01, subsection A and section 45-563.02, subsection B, shall establish in each plan a new irrigation water duty for each farm unit to be reached by the end of the third management period and may establish one or more intermediate water duties to be reached at specified intervals during the third management period. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, the irrigation water duty or intermediate water duties for the third management period shall be calculated as the quantity of water reasonably required to irrigate the crops historically grown in the farm unit and shall be computed by dividing the total irrigation requirement per acre of those crops by an irrigation efficiency of eighty per cent, except that a lower irrigation efficiency may be used for a farm unit or portion of a farm unit determined by the director to have limiting soils or excessive slopes and for a farm unit where orchard crops were historically grown and continue to be grown. After computing the irrigation water duty or intermediate water duties for the third management period, the director may adjust the highest twenty-five per cent of the water duties within an area of similar farming conditions by reducing each water duty in an amount up to ten per cent, except that in making the adjustment, no water duty may be reduced to an amount less than the greater of the following:

(a) The highest water duty within the lowest seventy-five per cent of the water duties computed within the area of similar farming conditions for the third management period.

(b) A water duty computed for the farm unit under this paragraph using an irrigation efficiency of eighty per cent.

2. Shall establish in each plan, except the plan for the Santa Cruz active management area, additional conservation requirements for all non-irrigation uses of groundwater to be achieved by the end of the third management period and may establish intermediate conservation requirements to be achieved at specified intervals during the third management period. In the plan for the Santa Cruz active management area, the director shall establish additional conservation requirements for all non-irrigation uses of water, other than stored water, withdrawn from a well to be achieved by the end of the third management period and may establish intermediate conservation requirements to be achieved at specified intervals during the third management period. For municipal uses, except as provided in section 45-566.01 and paragraphs 3 and 4 of this subsection, the program in each plan shall require additional reasonable reductions in per capita use to those required in the second management period and use of such other conservation measures as may be appropriate for individual users. For industrial uses, including industrial uses within the exterior boundaries of the service area of a city, town, private water company or irrigation district, the program in each plan shall require the use of or establish conservation requirements based on the use of the latest commercially available conservation technology consistent with reasonable economic return.

3. Shall establish in each plan conservation or rate of use requirements for deliveries of untreated water by large untreated water providers based on the use of the latest commercially available conservation technology consistent with reasonable economic return.

4. Shall establish in each plan reasonable conservation requirements for small municipal providers.

5. Except as provided in section 45-411.01, subsection B, shall establish in each plan, except the plan for the Santa Cruz active management area, additional economically reasonable conservation requirements for the distribution of groundwater by cities, towns, private water companies and irrigation districts within their service areas. In the plan for the Santa Cruz active management area, the director shall establish additional economically reasonable conservation requirements for the distribution of water, other than stored water, withdrawn from wells, for cities, towns, private water companies and irrigation districts within their service areas.

6. Shall include in each plan a program for additional augmentation of the water supply of the active management area, if feasible, including incentives for artificial groundwater recharge.

7. Shall, in cooperation with the department of environmental quality, include in each plan an assessment of groundwater quality in the active management area and any proposed program for groundwater quality protection. Any such program shall be submitted to the legislature for any necessary enabling legislation or coordination with existing programs of the department of environmental quality.

8. Shall include in each plan a program for conservation assistance to water users within the active management area.

9. May include in each plan a program for the purchase and retirement of grandfathered rights by the department to begin no earlier than January 1, 2006.

10. Shall establish in the plan for an active management area in which a groundwater replenishment district is located the historic annual net natural recharge for the groundwater replenishment district, computed by determining the net natural recharge, as defined by section 48-4401, for the groundwater basin beneath the district during calendar years 1967 through 1996 and dividing the result by thirty.

11. Shall include in the plan for the Santa Cruz active management area criteria for the location of new wells and replacement wells in new locations consistent with the management goal of the active management area.

12. Shall include in the plan for the Santa Cruz active management area an evaluation of the potential impact of the plan on the Tucson active management area.

13. Shall include in the plans for the Tucson, Phoenix and Pinal active management areas recommendations to the Arizona water banking authority regarding all of the following:

(a) Whether additional water storage in the active management area would help to achieve the management goal for the active management area.

(b) Where additional water storage in the active management area would be most useful to achieve the management goal for the active management area.

(c) Whether extinguishment of long-term storage credits accrued or to be accrued by the Arizona water banking authority would help to achieve the management goal for the active management area.

B. Within thirty days after the management plan for the third management period is adopted, the director shall give written notice in the manner and to the persons prescribed in section 45-565, subsection B. Two years before the compliance date specified in the management plan for any irrigation water duty, intermediate water duty, conservation requirement or intermediate conservation requirement, the director shall give additional written notice by first class mail to the last known addresses of the persons prescribed in section 45-565, subsection B.

C. Except for a person who has obtained a variance under section 45-574 or who is exempt from irrigation water duties under section 45-563.02, subsection A, all persons notified pursuant to subsection B of this section shall comply with the applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements for the third management period not later than January 1, 2010 and shall remain in compliance until the compliance date for any applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements established in the management plan for the fourth management period. If intermediate water duties or intermediate conservation requirements have been established, a person to whom those water duties or conservation requirements apply shall comply with the intermediate water duties or conservation requirements not later than the compliance date specified in the management plan unless the person obtains a variance pursuant to section 45-574 or is exempt from intermediate water duties under section 45-563.02, subsection A. A person who obtains a variance under section 45-574 shall comply with the applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements by the date specified in the variance and shall remain in compliance until the subsequent compliance date for any applicable irrigation water duty or conservation requirements established in the management plan for the third management period or, if that management plan does not establish any applicable subsequent compliance date, until the applicable compliance date established in the management plan for the fourth management period.

D. A person who is entitled to use groundwater pursuant to an irrigation grandfathered right may apply to the director at any time during the management period for an exemption from the irrigation water duties established pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section. The director shall grant the exemption if the person demonstrates to the director's satisfaction that granting the exemption is consistent with achieving the management goal of the active management area and that one of the following applies:

1. Withdrawal of groundwater pursuant to the irrigation grandfathered right during the management period will intercept the groundwater that would otherwise flow out of and be lost to the active management area within the next fifteen years without entering another active management area.

2. Withdrawal of groundwater pursuant to the irrigation grandfathered right during the management period will prevent encroachment of a rising depth to groundwater level that will cause waterlogging problems within the next fifteen years.

#### Section 45-566.01. Non-per capita conservation program for municipal providers; third management period

A. In addition to the provisions of the management plan for the third management period prescribed by section 45-566, subsection A, paragraph 2, no later than January 1, 2008, the director shall modify the management plan to replace the non-per capita conservation program for municipal providers in effect on the effective date of this amendment to this section with a non-per capita conservation program that is consistent with the guidelines in this amendment to this section.  Except as provided in subsections J, K, L and M of this section, all municipal providers shall comply with the non-per capita conservation program by the date prescribed in subsection I of this section. The non-per capita conservation program shall require a municipal provider regulated under the program to implement water conservation measures in its service area, including all of the following:

1. A public education program relating to water conservation.

2. A program to meter all service area connections, except connections to fire services, dwelling units in multifamily residential structures, mobile homes in mobile home parks with master meters and construction users.

3. One or more additional conservation measures selected by the provider from the list of conservation measures adopted by the director pursuant to subsection B of this section, subject to approval by the director pursuant to subsection G or H of this section.  The program may prescribe the number of additional conservation measures that a provider must implement under this paragraph based on the number of service connections in the provider's service area.

B. The director shall include in the non-per capita conservation program a list and description of conservation measures that municipal providers regulated under the program must select from to comply with the requirements adopted pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section.

C. In addition to the requirements prescribed in subsection A of this section, a municipal provider regulated under the non per-capita conservation program shall:

1. Include in its annual reports filed pursuant to section 45-632 a copy of the provider's current water rate structure unless no changes have been made to the rate structure since it was last submitted to the director. A municipal provider regulated under the non-per capita conservation program is encouraged to adopt a water rate structure that promotes efficient use of water, subject to approval by the corporation commission if the provider is a public service corporation.

2. For at least five years after a year in which the municipal provider is regulated under the non-per capita conservation program, keep and maintain accurate records verifying that the municipal provider implemented the conservation measures required by the non-per capita conservation program during that year.

1. No later than July 1, 2009, a municipal provider notified of the non-per capita conservation program pursuant to subsection E of this section shall submit to the director, on a form prescribed by the director, a provider profile that contains the following information:

(a) A description of the municipal provider's existing service area characteristics and water use patterns.

(b) A description of the conservation measures the municipal provider is currently implementing and any additional conservation measures that the provider intends to implement to comply with the non-per capita conservation program.

(c) An explanation of how each conservation measure described in the provider profile is relevant to the municipal provider's existing service area characteristics or water use patterns.

2. No later than the date specified in the management plan, a municipal provider notified of the non-per capita conservation program pursuant to section 45-571.01, subsection B shall submit to the director, on a form prescribed by the director, a provider profile that includes the information described in paragraph 1 of this subsection.

G. Within ninety days after receiving a municipal provider's provider profile under subsection F of this section, the director shall approve or disapprove the provider profile and send written notice of the decision to the municipal provider.  The director shall approve the provider profile if the director determines that the profile contains information demonstrating that the municipal provider will implement at least the minimum number of conservation measures required by the non-per capita conservation program and that the conservation measures are reasonably relevant to the municipal provider's existing service area characteristics or water use patterns.  If the director disapproves the provider profile, the director shall include with the written notice of the decision the reasons for the disapproval.  A decision of the director disapproving a provider profile is an appealable agency action pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.  If the director fails to send the municipal provider written notice approving or disapproving the municipal provider's provider profile within ninety days after receiving the provider profile, the provider profile shall be deemed approved.

H. If the director disapproves a municipal provider's provider profile pursuant to subsection G of this section, within ninety days after the date of the director's written notice disapproving the provider profile, or within ninety days after the director's decision is final if the municipal provider files a timely notice of appeal of the decision pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10, the municipal provider shall revise the provider profile to correct the deficiencies identified by the director in the written notice and submit the revised provider profile to the director.  Within ninety days after receiving a municipal provider's revised provider profile pursuant to this subsection, the director shall approve or disapprove the revised provider profile pursuant to subsection G of this section. If the director disapproves the revised provider profile:

1. The decision is an appealable agency action pursuant to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

2. The municipal provider is in violation of this section beginning on the date the director's decision is final until the municipal provider submits a provider profile that is approved by the director, except that the provider shall not be in violation before January 1, 2010.

A. Except as provided in subsections G and J of this section, a person who proposes to offer subdivided lands, as defined in section 32-2101, for sale or lease in an active management area shall apply for and obtain a certificate of assured water supply from the director prior to presenting the plat for approval to the city, town or county in which the land is located, where such is required, and prior to filing with the state real estate commissioner a notice of intention to offer such lands for sale or lease, pursuant to section 32-2181, unless the subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an assured water supply pursuant to this section.

B. Except as provided in subsections G and J of this section, a city, town or county may approve a subdivision plat only if the subdivider has obtained a certificate of assured water supply from the director or the subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an assured water supply pursuant to this section.  The city, town or county shall note on the face of the approved plat that a certificate of assured water supply has been submitted with the plat or that the subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the proposed subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an assured water supply pursuant to this section.

C. Except as provided in subsections G and J of this section, the state real estate commissioner may issue a public report authorizing the sale or lease of subdivided lands only on compliance with either of the following:

1. The subdivider, owner or agent has paid any activation fee required under section 48-3772, subsection A, paragraph 7 and any replenishment reserve fee required under section 48-3774.01, subsection A, paragraph 2 and has obtained a certificate of assured water supply from the director.

2. The subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the lands from a city, town or private water company designated as having an assured water supply pursuant to this section and the subdivider, owner or agent has paid any activation fee required under section 48-3772, subsection A, paragraph 7.

D. The director shall designate private water companies in active management areas that have an assured water supply. If a city or town acquires a private water company that has contracted for central Arizona project water, the city or town shall assume the private water company's contract for central Arizona project water.

E. The director shall designate cities and towns in active management areas where an assured water supply exists. If a city or town has entered into a contract for central Arizona project water, the city or town is deemed to continue to have an assured water supply until December 31, 1997.  Commencing on January 1, 1998, the determination that the city or town has an assured water supply is subject to review by the director and the director may determine that a city or town does not have an assured water supply.

F. The director shall notify the mayors of all cities and towns in active management areas and the chairmen of the boards of supervisors of counties in which active management areas are located of the cities, towns and private water companies designated as having an assured water supply and any modification of that designation within thirty days of the designation or modification.  If the service area of the city, town or private water company has qualified as a member service area pursuant to title 48, chapter 22, article 4, the director shall also notify the conservation district of the designation or modification and shall report the projected average annual replenishment obligation for the member service area based on the projected and committed average annual demand for water within the service area during the effective term of the designation or modification subject to any limitation in an agreement between the conservation district and the city, town or private water company.  For each city, town or private water company that qualified as a member service area under title 48, chapter 22 and was designated as having an assured water supply before January 1, 2004, the director shall report to the conservation district on or before January 1, 2005 the projected average annual replenishment obligation based on the projected and committed average annual demand for water within the service area during the effective term of the designation subject to any limitation in an agreement between the conservation district and the city, town or private water company. Persons proposing to offer subdivided lands served by those designated cities, towns and private water companies for sale or lease are exempt from applying for and obtaining a certificate of assured water supply.

The director has not revoked the certificate of assured water supply described in paragraph 1 of this subsection, and proceedings to revoke the certificate are not pending before the department or a court.  The department shall post on its website a list of all certificates of assured water supply that have been revoked or for which proceedings are pending before the department or a court.

3. The plat submitted to the department in the application for the certificate of assured water supply described in paragraph 1 of this subsection has not changed.

4. Water service is currently available to each lot within the subdivided land and the water provider listed on the certificate of assured water supply described in paragraph 1 of this subsection has not changed.

5. The subdivided land qualifies as a member land under title 48, chapter 22 and the subdivider has paid any activation fee required under section 48-3772, subsection A, paragraph 7 and any replenishment reserve fee required under section 48-3774.01, subsection A, paragraph 2.

6. The plat is submitted for approval to a city, town or county that is listed on the department's website as a qualified platting authority.

K. Subsection J of this section does not affect the assignment of a certificate of assured water supply as prescribed by section 45-579.

L. For the purposes of this section, "assured water supply" means all of the following:

1. Sufficient groundwater, surface water or effluent of adequate quality will be continuously available to satisfy the water needs of the proposed use for at least one hundred years. Beginning January 1 of the calendar year following the year in which a groundwater replenishment district is required to submit its preliminary plan pursuant to section 45-576.02, subsection A, paragraph 1, with respect to an applicant that is a member of the district, "sufficient groundwater" for the purposes of this paragraph means that the proposed groundwater withdrawals that the applicant will cause over a period of one hundred years will be of adequate quality and will not exceed, in combination with other withdrawals from land in the replenishment district, a depth to water of one thousand feet or the depth of the bottom of the aquifer, whichever is less. In determining depth to water for the purposes of this paragraph, the director shall consider the combination of:

(a) The existing rate of decline.

(b) The proposed withdrawals.

(c) The expected water requirements of all recorded lots that are not yet served water and that are located in the service area of a municipal provider.

2. The projected groundwater use is consistent with the management plan and achievement of the management goal for the active management area.

3. The financial capability has been demonstrated to construct the water facilities necessary to make the supply of water available for the proposed use, including a delivery system and any storage facilities or treatment works. The director may accept evidence of the construction assurances required by section 9-463.01, 11-823 or 32-2181 to satisfy this requirement.

 

#### Section 45-576.01. Determining consistency with management goal in a replenishment district, conservation district and water district

O. The director shall issue a decision that the water district's plan is consistent with achieving the management goal of the active management area in which the water district is located if the director finds that the water district has the current capability to meet the current and projected water district groundwater replenishment obligation, as that term is defined and used in title 48, chapter 28, for the five calendar years following the calendar year in which the water district submits its plan and, in addition, the director finds the water district has established an adequate plan to meet the projected water district groundwater replenishment obligation for the twenty calendar years following the calendar year in which the plan was submitted.

P. Unless the conservation district or water district successfully appeals the director's decision pursuant to subsection Q of this section, if the director finds for one or more active management areas that the conservation district's plan for operation or the water district's plan is not consistent with achieving the management goal of an active management area, the director shall notify the conservation district or water district, as the case may be, of the inconsistency in writing and shall specify how the conservation district's plan for operation or the water district's plan is inconsistent with achieving the management goal.  The conservation district or water district, as the case may be, shall modify its proposed plan and resubmit the plan within sixty days after it has been notified in writing of the director's decision, and the director shall review the plan as provided by section 45-576.02 and this section, except that the director shall only hold a hearing regarding those matters that the conservation district or water district, as the case may be, has modified in its resubmitted plan.

Q. The director's decision under subsection M or R of this section is subject to rehearing or review and to judicial review as provided in section 45-114, subsection C, but the court shall not issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction to prevent the director from acting under this chapter while the action is pending.

R. If, at any time between the second anniversary and the eighth anniversary of the director's determination of consistency with the management goal, the director finds that there has been either an unexpected increase in the conservation district's projected groundwater replenishment obligations or an unexpected reduction in water supplies available to meet the conservation district's current obligations such that the conservation district's plan no longer demonstrates consistency with the management goal for one or more active management areas, the director shall require the conservation district to submit a revised plan for operation.  The revised plan for operation shall be submitted within one calendar year after the date that the director notifies the conservation district of such a finding, unless the director extends this time for good cause.  The director shall review, hold a hearing on and make a decision on the revised plan as provided by this section, except that the director shall only hold a hearing regarding those conditions that have changed.

S. Unless the conservation district successfully appeals the director's decision pursuant to subsection Q of this section, if the director's decision includes a finding for one or more active management areas that the conservation district's revised plan for operation is not consistent with achieving the management goal of that active management area pursuant to this section and the conservation district is unable to satisfy the director's concerns within sixty days after the director has notified the conservation district of the decision, the determination that the district's plan is consistent with the management goal of the active management area shall expire.

 

#### Section 45-576.04. Report and review of plans by groundwater replenishment district

A. A holder of a certificate of assured water supply issued pursuant to section 45-576 may assign the certificate, in whole or in part, to another person if the holder applies to the director for approval within ten years after the original certificate was issued and the director approves the application. An application may be filed under this section more than ten years after the original certificate was issued if a minimum of five hundred lots within the subdivision covered by the certificate have been sold to individual home buyers by the holder of the certificate and any previous holders of the certificate. An application filed under this section shall be on a form prescribed by the director.  The director shall approve a timely application for assignment of a certificate of assured water supply if the director determines that all of the following apply:

1. The proposed assignee owns or is acquiring the subdivision to which the current certificate applies, or if the application is for a partial assignment, the portion of the subdivision to which the current certificate applies that is the subject of the proposed assignment.

2. There has not been any material change in the subdivision plat, plan or map since the certificate was originally issued, including an increase in the total water demand for the subdivision, including all assignments. For the purpose of this paragraph, a change in the total number of housing units or lots does not constitute a material change in a subdivision plat, plan or map if there is a reduction in the total water demand for the subdivision.

3. Either there is water delivery infrastructure in place that is capable of delivering water to each lot within the subdivision or the proposed assignee has demonstrated financial capability to complete the infrastructure. In determining whether the proposed assignee has demonstrated financial capability to complete the infrastructure, the director shall apply the same standards that are used in evaluating financial capability for a new certificate application.

4. The water provider serving the subdivision and the source of supply have not changed since the current certificate was issued and the water provider has agreed to serve the subdivision after the assignment.

5. Water rights, permits, licenses, contracts and easements other than the municipal provider’s service area rights at the time the current certificate was issued have been assigned and may be used to support water service to the portion of the subdivision that is the subject of the assignment and to any remaining portions of the subdivision that are retained by the subdivider.

6. There has not been any change in the manner in which the consistency with management goal requirements were satisfied at the time the original certificate was issued.

B. After a change of ownership has occurred and on approval of an assignment, the director shall issue a certificate of assured water supply in the name of the assignee, retaining the date of the original certificate as the date of issuance.

C. In the case of a partial assignment, the director shall issue a certificate in the name of the assignee for the portion of the subdivision that is the subject of the proposed assignment, and shall issue a certificate in the name of the assignor for the portion of the subdivision retained, each with the date of the original certificate as the date of issuance. The new certificates shall include all water demand for the subdivision represented by the current certificate. The allocation of demand between the certificates shall be based on a reasonable plan for allocation of the total subdivision demand as approved by the director.

D. Section 45-578 does not apply to an application filed under this section. Section 45-114, subsections A and B govern administrative proceedings, rehearing and review and judicial review of final decisions of the director under this section.  If an administrative hearing is held, it shall be conducted in the active management area in which the use is located.

E. Within two business days after receiving an application under subsection A of this section, the director shall post notice of the application on the department's website until the director issues a decision on the application. The notice shall include notice of the right to submit comments on the application as provided in this subsection, including a toll free number where comments may be submitted by telephone and the addresses where comments may be submitted by United States mail, electronic mail and hand delivery. Any person may submit comments on the application within fourteen calendar days after the first day that notice of the application is posted on the department's website. The director shall consider all timely comments submitted on the application before issuing a decision on the application. Within two business days after issuing a decision on the application, the director shall post notice of the decision on the department's website for a minimum of fourteen days. Notwithstanding title 41, chapter 6, article 10 and section 45-114, a person who submits comments on an application pursuant to this subsection is not a party for purposes of title 41, chapter 6, article 10, is not entitled to an administrative hearing before or after the director's decision on the application and is not entitled to judicial review of the director's decision.

F. For the purposes of this section, "original certificate" means the initial certificate of assured water supply that is issued by the director for a subdivision.

#### Section 45-579.01. Certificate of assured water supply; material change; plat

For the purpose of determining whether changes to a plat for which a certificate has been issued in an active management area are material under rules adopted pursuant to section 45-576, subsection H, the director shall not consider any change in the number of housing units or lots if there is a reduction in the total water demand for the subdivision.

#### Section 45-580. Assured and adequate water supply administration fund; purpose

A. The assured and adequate water supply administration fund is established consisting of the fees that are paid to the department for applications relating to adequate and assured water supply pursuant to sections 45-108, 45-576 and 45-579 and that are established by the director pursuant to section 45-113, subsection B.  The department shall administer the fund.  Monies in the fund are subject to appropriation and shall be used by the department for the costs and expenses of the department in administering sections 45-108, 45-576 and 45-579.

1. Include the county assessor's parcel identification number.

2. Show the proposed well location and the location of any septic tank or sewer system that is either located on the property or within one hundred feet of the proposed well site.

3. Show written approval by the county health authority that controls the installation of septic tanks or sewer systems in the county, or by the local health authority in areas where the authority to control installation of septic tanks or sewer systems has been delegated to a local authority.  In areas where there is no local or county authority that controls the installation of septic tanks or sewer systems, the applicant shall apply for approval directly to the department of water resources.

G. Before approving a well site plan submitted pursuant to subsection F of this section, the county or local health authority or the department of water resources, as applicable, pursuant to subsection F of this section, shall review the well site plan and determine whether the proposed well location complies with applicable local laws, ordinances and regulations and any laws or rules adopted under this title and title 49 regarding the placement of wells and the proximity of wells to septic tanks or sewer systems.  If the health authority or the department of water resources, as applicable, pursuant to subsection F of this section, finds that the proposed well location complies with this title and title 49 and with local requirements, it shall endorse the site plan and the proposed well placement in a manner indicating approval. On endorsement, the director of water resources shall approve the construction of the well, if all remaining requirements have been met. If the health authority is unable to determine whether the proposed well location complies with this title and title 49 and local requirements, it shall indicate this on the site plan and the decision to approve or reject the proposed construction rests with the director of water resources.  If parcel size, geology or location of improvements on the property prevents the well from being drilled in accordance with this title and title 49 or local requirements, the property owner may apply for a variance. The property owner shall make the request for a variance to the county or local authority if a county or local law, ordinance or regulation prevents the proposed construction. If a law or rule adopted under this title or title 49 prevents the proposed construction, the property owner shall make the request for a variance directly to the department of water resources.  The request for a variance shall be in the form and shall contain the information that the department of water resources, county or local authority may require. The department of water resources, or the county or local authority whose law, ordinance or regulation prevents the proposed construction, may expressly require that a particular variance shall include certification by a registered professional engineer or geologist that the location of the well will not pose a health hazard to the applicant or surrounding property or inhabitants. If all necessary variances are obtained, the director of water resources shall approve the construction of the well if all remaining requirements have been met.

H. If a well that was originally drilled as an exploration well, a monitor well or a piezometer well or for any use other than domestic use is later proposed to be converted to use for domestic purposes as defined in section 45-454, the well owner shall file a notice of intention to drill and shall comply with this section before the well is converted and any water from that well is used for domestic purposes.

I. Except as prescribed in subsection K of this section, the director shall not approve the drilling of the well if the director determines that the well will likely cause the migration of contaminated groundwater from a remedial action site to another well, resulting in unreasonably increasing damage to the owner of the well or persons using water from the well.  In making this determination, the director of water resources shall follow the applicable criteria in the rules adopted by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-598, subsection A and shall consult with the director of environmental quality.  For the purposes of this subsection:

If the stored water to be recovered is effluent that is stored in a managed underground storage facility and if the proposed recovery well is not an already constructed well owned by the person recovering the water and is located within the exterior boundaries of the service area of a city, town, private water company or irrigation district, that city, town, private water company or irrigation district must be notified by the person recovering the stored water and must have the right to offer to recover the water stored on behalf of that person.  If the city, town, private water company or irrigation district offers to recover the water on behalf of the person seeking recovery and the water that is offered for recovery is of comparable quality to the water that the person could recover, the person seeking to recover the water shall consider accepting the best offer from the city, town, private water company or irrigation district overlying the area of impact that has offered to recover the stored water.

(b) The proposed recovery well is located outside the area of impact of the stored water, as determined by the director, and all of the following apply:

(i) The proposed recovery well is located within the same active management area as storage.

(ii) The director determines that recovery at the proposed location is consistent with the management plan and achievement of the management goal for the active management area.

(iii) If the proposed recovery well is located within the exterior boundaries of the service area of a city, town, private water company or irrigation district, that city, town, private water company or irrigation district is the person seeking to recover the water or has consented to the location of the recovery well.

(iv) If the proposed recovery well is located outside, but within three miles of, the exterior boundaries of the service area of a city, town, private water company or irrigation district, the closest city, town, private water company or irrigation district has consented to the location of the recovery well.

(c) The proposed recovery well is located within the area of impact of the stored water, as determined by the director, the person recovering the water is not the storer, the stored water to be recovered is not Colorado river water and all of the conditions prescribed by subdivision (b), items (i) through (iv) of this paragraph are met.

3. For water stored outside of an active management area, if recovery will occur within the same irrigation non-expansion area, groundwater basin or groundwater sub-basin, as applicable, in which the water was stored.

B. Before recovering from any well water stored pursuant to a water storage permit, a person shall apply for and receive a recovery well permit from the director.  The director shall issue the recovery well permit if the director determines that:

1. If the application is for a new well, as defined in section 45-591, or except as provided in paragraphs 2 and 3 of this subsection for an existing well, as defined in section 45-591, the proposed recovery of stored water will not unreasonably increase damage to surrounding land or other water users from the concentration of wells.  The director shall make this determination pursuant to rules adopted by the director.

2. If the applicant is a city, town, private water company or irrigation district in an active management area and the application is for an existing well within the service area of the city, town, private water company or irrigation district, the applicant has a right to use the existing well.

3. If the applicant is a conservation district and the application is for an existing well within the conservation district and within the groundwater basin or sub-basin in which the stored water is located, the applicant has a right to use the existing well.

C.

D. If the applicant is a conservation district, the director may issue an emergency temporary recovery well permit without complying with section 45-871.01, subsection F if the director determines that all of the following apply:

1. The conservation district cannot reasonably continue to supply central Arizona project water directly to a city, town, private water company or irrigation district due to an unplanned failure of a portion of the central Arizona project delivery system.

2. The emergency temporary recovery well permit is necessary to allow the conservation district to provide immediate delivery of replacement water to the city, town, private water company or irrigation district.

3. The application is for an existing well as defined in section 45-591 that is within the groundwater basin or groundwater sub-basin in which the stored water is located, is within the conservation district and is within the service area of the city, town, private water company or irrigation district.

E. An emergency temporary recovery well permit issued pursuant to subsection D of this section may be issued for a period of up to ninety days and may be extended for additional ninety day periods if the director determines that the conditions prescribed in subsection D of this section continue to apply.

F. If the application for a recovery well permit is approved, the director shall issue a permit and the applicant may proceed to construct or use the well.  If the application is rejected, the applicant shall not proceed to construct or use the well.  A new well shall be completed within one year of receipt of the permit, unless the director in granting the permit approves a longer period to complete the well.  If the well is not completed within one year or the longer period approved by the director, the applicant shall file a new application before proceeding with construction.

G. A recovery well permit shall include the following information:

1. The name and mailing address of the person to whom the permit is issued.

1. A written notice of the party's intent to begin the delivery of central Arizona project water that is available to the Indian community to the holder of grandfathered groundwater rights in an active management area.

2. A sworn statement by the holder of the grandfathered groundwater rights that the holder will use the water delivered off of Indian community lands on a gallon-for-gallon substitute basis instead of groundwater that otherwise would have been pumped pursuant to the grandfathered groundwater rights from within an active management area.

3. A listing and description of the grandfathered groundwater rights that will not be exercised by the holder because of the delivery of the water that is delivered by the Indian community.

4. A hydrologic report assessing the effect of nonexercise of grandfathered groundwater rights under this section on any underground storage facility that was constructed as a state demonstration project and that is located within ten miles of the point of withdrawal for the grandfathered groundwater rights.

E. The director shall review the hydrologic report filed pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 4 of this section and shall make such modifications to the state demonstration project's underground storage facility permit as the director deems appropriate.

F. If the director determines that the parties have complied with subsection D of this section, the Indian community may begin accruing long-term storage credits for the delivery of central Arizona project water to the holder of the grandfathered groundwater rights, but only if the following apply:

1. By March 31 of each year, the holder of the grandfathered groundwater rights files an annual report with the director for the preceding calendar year.  The annual report shall include the following information:

(a) The total quantity of water received from the Indian community during the year for use by the holder under this section.

(b) A listing of those grandfathered groundwater rights that were not exercised during the year by the holder because of the receipt of central Arizona project water delivered by the Indian community.

(c) Such other information as the director may reasonably require.

2. The director finds that the water reported as received by the grandfathered groundwater right holder was used on a gallon-for-gallon substitute basis for groundwater.

3. The Indian community has offered to sell the Arizona water banking authority ten per cent of any long-term storage credits accruable by the Indian community under this section at a price per acre-foot at the time of sale equal to the authority's cost of delivering and storing water at an underground storage facility that was constructed as a state demonstration project and that is located within ten miles of the point of withdrawal of any of the grandfathered groundwater rights identified in the list filed with the director pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 3 of this section, except that any credits purchased pursuant to such offer may not be recovered within five miles of the exterior reservation boundary of the Indian community.

G. The water that is received under this section by the holder of the grandfathered groundwater right is deemed to be groundwater for all purposes of chapter 2 of this title as if the holder had withdrawn it from a well. The holder is responsible for all records, reports and fees required by chapter 2 of this title relating to the water received.

H. The director shall establish a long-term storage account for the Indian community in accordance with section 45-852.01 and each year shall credit to that long-term storage account ninety-five per cent of the water received by the holder of the grandfathered groundwater right during the preceding year that meets the requirements of subsection F of this section.

### Article 4 - Accounting

#### Section 45-851.01. Recovery of stored water on an annual basis

A. Except as provided in subsections B, E and F of this section, a storer may recover the recoverable amount of water stored after January 1 of a calendar year on or before December 31 of the same calendar year.

B. If water is stored pursuant to a water storage permit and its use is based on a decreed or appropriative water right, the approximate recoverable amount of water stored in a month shall be recovered on or before the last day of the following month or within the same calendar year, whichever is earlier, unless the water is credited to a long-term storage account as prescribed by section 45-852.01.

C. Water stored after January 1 of a calendar year and not recovered on or before December 31 of the same calendar year may be credited to the storer's long-term storage account to the extent that the stored water is eligible for long-term storage credits as prescribed by section 45-852.01.

D. Water that is stored after January 1 of a calendar year, that is not recovered on or before December 31 of the same calendar year and that is not eligible to be credited to the storer's long-term storage account may not be recovered at any other time.

E. If the water stored was effluent stored at a managed underground storage facility that has not been designated as a facility that could add value to a national park, national monument or state park and subsection F of this section does not apply, the storer may recover during a year only fifty percent of the recoverable amount of water stored between January 1 and December 31 of that year. If the storer recovers during the year less than fifty percent of the recoverable amount of the water stored during that year, the difference between fifty percent of the recoverable amount and the amount of stored water recovered during the year may be credited to the storer's long-term storage account to the extent that the stored water is eligible for long-term storage credits as prescribed by section 45-852.01.

F. If the water stored was effluent stored at a managed underground storage facility that qualifies as an existing effluent managed underground storage facility and that has not been designated as a facility that could add value to a national park, national monument or state park, the storer may recover during a year only ninety-five percent of the recoverable amount of the water stored between January 1 and December 31 of that year.  If the storer recovers during the year less than ninety-five percent of the recoverable amount of the water stored during that year, the difference between ninety-five percent of the recoverable amount and the amount of stored water recovered during the year may be credited to the storer's long-term storage account to the extent that the stored water is eligible for long-term storage credits as prescribed by section 45-852.01.

#### Section 45-852.01. Long-term storage accounts

A. The director shall establish one long-term storage account for each person holding long-term storage credits. The director shall establish subaccounts within the long-term storage account according to each active management area, irrigation non-expansion area, groundwater basin or groundwater subbasin in which the person's stored water is located.  The long-term storage account shall be further subdivided by type of water, if the person holds long-term storage credits for more than one type of water.

B. Water stored pursuant to a water storage permit at a storage facility may be credited to a long-term storage account if the director determines that all of the following apply:

1. Either:

(a) The water that was stored was water that cannot reasonably be used directly.

(b) The water was stored in a groundwater savings facility located in an active management area that does not have a management goal of achieving or maintaining a safe yield condition, the water was stored between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2026 and the director determines that the storage assists in implementing within this state a drought contingency plan for the lower basin of the Colorado River.  The total maximum amount that may qualify under this subdivision is fifteen thousand acre-feet per year.

2. If the stored water was stored at a storage facility within an active management area, either:

(a) The water would not have been naturally recharged within the active management area.

(b) If the water was stored at a managed underground storage facility that has been designated as a facility that could add value to a national park, national monument or state park and the water stored is effluent, the water stored is water that could have been used or disposed of by the storer by means other than discharging the effluent into the stream.

3. The stored water was not recovered on an annual basis pursuant to section 45-851.01.

C. The director shall credit ninety-five percent of the recoverable amount of stored water that meets the requirements of subsection B of this section to the storer's long-term storage account, except that:

1. If the water was stored at a managed underground storage facility that does not qualify as an existing effluent managed underground storage facility and that had not been designated at the time of storage as a facility that could add value to a national park, national monument or state park and the water stored is effluent, the director shall credit to the storer's long-term storage account fifty percent of the recoverable amount of water that meets the requirements of subsection B of this section.  For storage of effluent in a managed underground storage facility that is located in a recreational corridor channelization district established pursuant to title 48, chapter 35, the director may increase the storage credits earned from fifty percent to ninety-five percent if both of the following apply:

(a) The effluent was not discharged into the stream where the facility is located before the permit application for that facility was filed.

(b) The director determines that the storage of effluent in the facility will provide a greater benefit to aquifer conditions in the active management area or, if outside an active management area, to the groundwater basin than would accrue to the active management area or groundwater basin if the effluent is used or disposed of in another manner.

2. If the water was stored at a groundwater savings facility and the storer has not met the burden of proving that one hundred percent of the in lieu water was used on a gallon-for-gallon substitute basis for groundwater, the director shall credit to the storer's long-term storage account only the percentage of the in lieu water that meets the requirements of subsection B of this section and that was proven to the director's satisfaction as being used on a gallon-for-gallon substitute basis for groundwater.

3. The director shall credit to the storer's long-term storage account ninety percent of the recoverable amount of the water that meets the requirements of subsection B of this section if all of the following apply:

(a) The stored water was central Arizona project water that qualifies as water that cannot reasonably be used directly due solely to the exclusion of groundwater withdrawn by the storer for mineral extraction or metallurgical processing under section 45-802.01, paragraph  23, subdivision (c).

(b) The storer was engaged in mineral extraction and metallurgical processing within an initial active management area on or before January 1, 2011.

(c) All exterior boundaries of the storage facility that is used to store the stored water are more than twenty miles from a well owned by the storer on January 1, 2012 and that well is not an exempt well and any one or more of the following apply:

(i) The well is an existing well as defined in section 45-591, paragraph 1.

(ii) The department has issued a permit for the well under section 45-599, subsection C.

(iii) The well was drilled pursuant to a mineral extraction and metallurgical processing permit issued by the department under section 45-514.

4. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 2 of this subsection, the director shall credit to the storer's long-term storage account or conservation district account one hundred percent of the recoverable amount of water that meets the requirements of subsection B of this section if any of the following applies:

(a) The water stored was effluent that was stored at a constructed underground storage facility, a groundwater savings facility or a managed underground storage facility that was designated at the time of storage as a facility that could add value to a national park, national monument or state park.

(b) The water was stored in an active management area and the stored water is water from outside the active management area that would not have reached the active management area without the efforts of the holder of the long-term storage credits.

(c) The water was stored outside an active management area and the stored water is water from outside the groundwater basin in which the water was stored that would not have reached the groundwater basin without the efforts of the holder of the long-term storage credits.

(d) The water was stored for purposes of establishing and maintaining a replenishment reserve pursuant to section 48-3772, subsection E.

(e) The water was stored for replenishment purposes pursuant to section 48-3771 and credited directly to a conservation district account pursuant to section 45-859.01, subsection E.

D. The director shall credit a person's long-term storage account by the amount of long-term storage credits assigned to that person by another holder of long-term storage credits pursuant to section 45-854.01.

E. The director shall debit the appropriate subaccount of a person's long-term storage account:

1. One hundred percent of the amount of stored water that the holder of the long-term storage credits has recovered during the calendar year pursuant to the permit.

2. The amount of long-term storage credits that the person has assigned to another person or transferred to a master replenishment account, conservation district account or water district account.

3. If the water was stored in an active management area, the amount of water during the calendar year that migrates to a location outside the active management area or to a location within the active management area where it cannot be beneficially used within a reasonable period of time by persons other than the storer with rights to withdraw and use groundwater.

4. If the water was stored outside of an active management area, the amount of water during the calendar year that migrates to a location outside the groundwater basin in which the storage facility is located or to a location in the groundwater basin where it cannot be beneficially used within a reasonable period of time by persons other than the storer with rights to withdraw and use groundwater.

5. The amount of long-term storage credits that the storer, pursuant to section 45-853.01, subsection B, has applied to offset groundwater withdrawn or used in excess of the storer's per capita municipal conservation requirements under the second management plan.

6. The amount of long-term storage credits that are held by the Arizona water banking authority and that the authority has chosen to extinguish.

F. To the extent the total amount of water withdrawn by a person from wells designated as recovery wells pursuant to section 45-834.01 during a calendar year exceeds the amount of stored water recovered by the person on an annual basis pursuant to section 45-851.01 and the amount of long-term storage credits recovered by the person, the excess amount of water recovered shall be considered groundwater withdrawn pursuant to chapter 2 of this title.

#### Section 45-853.01. Restricted uses of long-term storage credits

A. If the director has included an amount of long-term storage credits under section 45-855.01:

1. In determining whether to issue a certificate of assured water supply to the holder of the long-term storage credits, that amount of long-term storage credits shall be recovered only for a use that, as determined by the director, supplies water to the subdivision to which the certificate of assured water supply applies.

2. In designating or redesignating a city, town or private water company as having an assured water supply, that amount of long-term storage credits shall be recovered only for a use that, as determined by the director, supplies water to that city, town or private water company.

3.

4. In designating a city, town or private water company as having an adequate water supply, that amount of long-term storage credits shall be recovered only for a use that, as determined by the director, supplies water to that city, town or private water company.

B. The storer of long-term storage credits may apply those long-term storage credits to offset any amount of groundwater that the storer withdraws or uses before 2000 in excess of the storer's per capita municipal conservation requirement in violation of the second management plan if the storer proves to the satisfaction of the director that the following conditions are met:

1. The storer stored the water at a storage facility that is located in the same active management area as the storer's service area.

2. The long-term storage credits used to offset the storer's per capita municipal conservation requirements violation were earned before 2000.

3. The water stored was effluent or central Arizona project water.

C. Long-term storage credits may not be used to demonstrate an assured water supply or an adequate water supply if the long-term storage credits were accrued by storing effluent at a managed underground storage facility that has not been designated as a facility that could add value to a national park, national monument or state park and any of the following applies:

1. The managed underground storage facility does not qualify as an existing effluent managed underground storage facility.

2. The managed underground storage facility qualifies as an existing effluent managed underground storage facility and the long-term storage credits were accrued before January 31, 2019.

#### Section 45-854.01. Assignability of long-term storage credits

A. Except as provided in section 45-855.01, subsection C, the holder of long-term storage credits may assign by grant, gift, sale, lease or exchange all or part of the holder's long-term storage credits.

B. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, an assignment of long-term storage credits from one person to another is valid on receipt by the director of notification of the assignment in writing on a form that is provided by the director and that has been signed by both the assignor and assignee.

C. The director may reject and invalidate any assignment of long-term storage credits in which the stored water would not have met the requirements for long-term storage credits as prescribed by section 45-852.01 if the assignee had stored the water.

#### Section 45-855.01. Effect of long-term storage credits on assured water supply and adequate water supply

A. In an active management area, except as provided in section 45-853.01, subsection C, and on the request of a person who holds long-term storage credits, the director shall include the amount of long-term storage credits requested by the person in determining whether to issue a certificate of assured water supply to the person pursuant to section 45-576, or if the person is a city, town or private water company, whether to designate or redesignate the city, town or private water company as having an assured water supply. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit or require the director to include projected additions to a long-term storage account in determining whether to issue a certificate of assured water supply to the person, or if the person is a city, town or private water company, whether to designate or redesignate the city, town or private water company as having an assured water supply.

B. Outside an active management area, except as provided in section 45-853.01, subsection C and on the request of a person who holds long-term storage credits, the director shall include the amount of long-term storage credits requested by the person in determining whether to issue a report of adequate water supply pursuant to section 45-108 for a subdivision to the person, or if the person is a city, town or private water company, whether to designate the city, town or private water company as having an adequate water supply. This subsection shall not be construed to prohibit or require the director to include projected additions to a long-term storage account in determining whether to issue a report of adequate water supply for a subdivision to the person, or if the person who holds the long-term storage account is a city, town or private water company, whether to designate the city, town or private water company as having an adequate water supply.

C. Long-term storage credits included by the director in making the determinations and designations in subsections A and B of this section are not assignable by the person holding the credits, unless the director has determined that the credits will continue to be used for the subdivision for which the certificate of assured water supply or certificate of adequate water supply has been issued or for the service area that has been designated as having an assured water supply or an adequate water supply.

The lien shall have the force and effect of a mechanic's and materialman's lien and may be foreclosed at any time within two years.

E. The lien referred to in subsection D of this section may be perfected and foreclosed in advance of construction or repair or after completion of the repairs. If in advance, the lien shall be perfected by the filing of an affidavit of the director setting forth the estimate of the costs of construction or repair with the county recorder in the county in which the dam is located in the same manner as prescribed for mechanics' liens in title 33, chapter 7, article 6 and may be foreclosed in the same manner as a mechanic's and materialman's lien. When the affidavit is filed, the amount set forth in the affidavit shall be a lien in such amount against all property of the owner. If the actual cost of construction or repair exceeds the estimated cost, the director may amend the affidavit setting forth the additional estimated cost. If the estimated cost exceeds the actual costs of construction or repair at completion, the director shall file an amended affidavit at completion. If a lien is perfected in advance and the construction or repair is not commenced within two years from the date of perfection, the lien shall be void. The director shall file a satisfaction of lien upon payment of the costs of construction or repair by the owner.

#### Section 45-1213. Inspection upon complaint

Upon receipt of a written complaint that the person or property of the complainant is endangered by any dam, the director shall inspect such dam unless his records disclose that the complaint is without merit. If the complainant insists upon an inspection and deposits with the director an amount sufficient to cover costs of inspection, the inspection shall be made. If an unsafe condition is found, the director shall cause it to be corrected, and the deposit shall be returned. If the complaint was without merit the deposit shall be paid into the general fund.

#### Section 45-1214. Investigations for review of design and construction

WITNESSETH THAT:

EXPLANATORY RECITALS

2. WHEREAS, for the purpose of controlling floods, improving navigation, regulating the flow of the Colorado River, providing for storage and for the delivery of stored waters for the reclamation of public lands and other beneficial uses exclusively within the United States, the Secretary acting under and in pursuance of the provisions of the Colorado River Compact and Boulder Canyon Project Act, and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, has constructed and is now operating and maintaining in the main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon that certain structure known as and designated Boulder Dam and incidental works, creating thereby a reservoir designated Lake Mead of a capacity of about thirty-two million (32,000,000) acre-feet, and

3. WHEREAS, said Boulder Canyon Project Act provides that the Secretary under such general rules and regulations, as he may prescribe, may contract for the storage of water in the reservoir created by Boulder Dam, and for the delivery of such water at such points on the river as may be agreed upon, for irrigation and domestic uses, and provides further that no person shall have or be entitled to have the use for any purpose of the water stored, as aforesaid, except by contract made as stated in said Act, and

4. WHEREAS, it is the desire of the parties to this contract to contract for the storage of water and the delivery thereof for irrigation of lands and domestic uses within Arizona, and

5. WHEREAS, nothing in this contract shall be construed as affecting the obligations of the United States to Indian tribes,

6. NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows, to wit: DELIVERY OF WATER

7. (a) Subject to the availability thereof for use in Arizona under the provisions of the Colorado River Compact and the Boulder Canyon Project Act, the United States shall deliver and Arizona, or agencies or water users therein, will accept under this contract each calendar year from storage in Lake Mead, at a point or points of diversion on the Colorado River approved by the Secretary, so much water as may be necessary for the beneficial consumptive use for irrigation and domestic uses in Arizona of a maximum of 2,800,000 acre-feet.

(b) The United States also shall deliver from storage in Lake Mead for use in Arizona, at a point or points of diversion on the Colorado River approved by the Secretary, for the uses set forth in subdivision (a) of this Article, one-half of any excess or surplus waters unapportioned by the Colorado River Compact to the extent such water is available for use in Arizona under said compact and said act, less such excess or surplus water unapportioned by said compact as may be used in Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah in accordance with the rights of said states as stated in subdivisions (f) and (g) of this Article.

(c) This contract is subject to the condition that Boulder Dam and Lake Mead shall be used: First, for river regulation, improvement of navigation, and flood control; second, for irrigation and domestic uses and satisfaction of perfected rights in pursuance of Article VIII of the Colorado River Compact; and third, for power. This contract is made upon the express condition and with the express covenant that the United States and Arizona, and agencies and water users therein, shall observe and be subject to and controlled by said Colorado River Compact and the Boulder Canyon Project Act in the construction, management, and operation of Boulder Dam, Lake Mead, canals and other works, and the storage, diversion, delivery and use of water for the generation of power, irrigation and other uses.

(d) The obligation to deliver water at or below Boulder Dam shall be diminished to the extent that consumptive uses now or hereafter existing in Arizona above Lake Mead diminish the flow into Lake Mead, and such obligation shall be subject to such reduction on account of evaporation, reservoir and river losses, as may be required to render this contract in conformity with said compact and said act.

(e) This contract is for permanent service, subject to the conditions stated in subdivision (c) of this Article, but as to the one-half of the waters of the Colorado River system unapportioned by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of Article III of the Colorado River Compact, such water is subject to further equitable apportionment at any time after October 1, 1963, as provided in Article III (f) and Article III (g) of the Colorado River Compact.

(f) Arizona recognizes the right of the United States and the State of Nevada to contract for the delivery from storage in Lake Mead for annual beneficial consumptive use within Nevada for agricultural and domestic uses of 300,000 acre-feet of the water apportioned to the Lower Basin by the Colorado River Compact, and in addition thereto to make contract for like use of 1/25 (one twenty-fifth) of any excess or surplus waters available in the Lower Basin and unapportioned by the Colorado River Compact, which waters are subject to further equitable apportionment after October 1, 1963 as provided in Article III (f) and Article III (g) of the Colorado River Compact.

(g) Arizona recognizes the rights of New Mexico and Utah to equitable shares of the water apportioned by the Colorado River Compact to the Lower Basin and also water unapportioned by such compact, and nothing contained in this contract shall prejudice such rights.

(h) Arizona recognizes the right of the United States and agencies of the State of California to contract for storage and delivery of water from Lake Mead for beneficial consumptive use in California, provided that the aggregate of all such deliveries and uses in California from the Colorado River shall not exceed the limitation of such uses in that State required by the provisions of the Boulder Canyon Project Act and agreed to by the State of California by an act of its Legislature (Chapter 16, Statutes of California of 1929) upon which limitation the State of Arizona expressly relies.

(i) Nothing in this contract shall preclude the parties hereto from contracting for storage and delivery above Lake Mead of water herein contracted for, when and if authorized by law.

(j) As far as reasonable diligence will permit, the water provided for in this contract shall be delivered as ordered and as reasonably required for domestic and irrigation uses within Arizona.  The United States reserves the right to discontinue or temporarily reduce the amount of water to be delivered, for the purpose of investigation and inspection, maintenance, repairs, replacements or installation of equipment or machinery at Boulder Dam, or other dams heretofore or hereafter to be constructed, but so far as feasible will give reasonable notice in advance of such temporary discontinuance or reduction.

(k) The United States, its officers, agents and employees shall not be liable for damages when for any reason whatsoever suspensions or reductions in the delivery of water occur.

(l) Deliveries of water hereunder shall be made for use within Arizona to such individuals, irrigation districts, corporations or political subdivisions therein of Arizona as may contract therefor with the Secretary, and as may qualify under the Reclamation Law or other federal statutes or to lands of the United States within Arizona. All consumptive uses of water by users in Arizona, of water diverted from Lake Mead or from the main stream of the Colorado River below Boulder Dam, whether made under this contract or not, shall be deemed, when made, a discharge pro tanto of the obligation of this contract. Present perfected rights to the beneficial use of waters of the Colorado River system are unimpaired by this contract.

(m) Rights-of-way across public lands necessary or convenient for canals to facilitate the full utilization in Arizona of the water herein agreed to be delivered will be granted by the Secretary subject to applicable federal statutes.

POINTS OF DIVERSION: MEASUREMENTS OF WATER

8. The water to be delivered under this contract shall be measured at the points of diversion, or elsewhere as the Secretary may designate (with suitable adjustment for losses between said points of diversion and measurement), by measuring and controlling devices or automatic gauges approved by the secretary, which devices, however, shall be furnished, installed, and maintained by Arizona, or the users of water therein in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary; said measuring and controlling devices or automatic gauges shall be subject to the inspection of the United States, whose authorized representatives may at all times have access to them, and any deficiencies found shall be promptly corrected by the users thereof. The United States shall be under obligation to deliver water only at diversion points where measuring and controlling devices or automatic gauges are maintained, in accordance with this contract, but in the event diversions are made at points where such devices are not maintained, the secretary shall estimate the quantity of such diversions and his determination thereof shall be final.

CHARGES FOR STORAGE AND DELIVERY OF WATER

9. No charge shall be made for the storage or delivery of water at diversion points as herein provided necessary to supply present perfected rights in Arizona.  A charge of 50¢ per acre-foot shall be made for all water actually diverted directly from Lake Mead during the Boulder Dam cost repayment period, which said charge shall be paid by the users of such water, subject to reduction by the Secretary in the amount of the charge if it is concluded by him at any time during said cost-repayment period that such charge is too high.  After expiration of the cost-repayment period, charges shall be on such basis as may hereafter be prescribed by Congress.  Charges for the storage or delivery of water diverted at a point or points below Boulder Dam, for users, other than those specified above, shall be as agreed upon between the Secretary and such users at the time of execution of contracts therefor, and shall be paid by such users; provided such charges shall, in no event, exceed 25 per acre-foot.

RESERVATIONS

10. Neither Article 7, nor any other provision of this contract, shall impair the right of Arizona and other states and the users of water therein to maintain, prosecute or defend any action respecting, and is without prejudice to, any of the respective contentions of said states and water users as to (1) the intent, effect, meaning and interpretation of said compact and said act; (2) what part, if any, of the water used or contracted for by any of them falls within Article III (a) of the Colorado River Compact; (3) what part, if any, is within Article III (b) thereof; (4) what part, if any, is excess or surplus waters unapportioned by said Compact; and (5) what limitations on use, rights of use and relative priorities exist as to the waters of the Colorado River system; provided, however, that by these reservations there is no intent to disturb the apportionment made by Article III (a) of the Colorado River Compact between the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin.

DISPUTES AND DISAGREEMENTS

11. Whenever a controversy arises out of this contract, and if the parties hereto then agree to submit the matter to arbitration, Arizona shall name one arbitrator and the Secretary shall name one arbitrator and the two arbitrators thus chosen shall meet within ten days after their selection and shall elect one other arbitrator within fifteen days after their first meeting, but in the event of their failure to name the third arbitrator within thirty days after their first meeting, such arbitrator not so selected shall be named by the Senior Judge of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  The decision of any two of the three arbitrators thus chosen shall be a valid and binding award.

RULES AND REGULATIONS

12. The Secretary may prescribe and enforce rules and regulations governing the delivery and diversion of waters hereunder, but such rules and regulations shall be promulgated, modified, revised or extended from time to time only after notice to the State of Arizona and opportunity is given to it to be heard. Arizona agrees for itself, its agencies and water users that in the operation and maintenance of the works for diversion and use of the water to be delivered hereunder, all such rules and regulations will be fully adhered to.

AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO COLORADO RIVER COMPACT

13. This contract is made upon the express condition and with the express covenant that all rights of Arizona, its agencies and water users, to waters of the Colorado River and its tributaries, and the use of the same, shall be subject to and controlled by the Colorado River Compact signed at Santa Fe, New Mexico, November 24, 1922, pursuant to the Act of Congress approved August 19, 1921 (42 Stat. 171), as approved by the Boulder Canyon Project Act.

EFFECTIVE DATE OF CONTRACT

14. This contract shall be of no effect unless it is unconditionally ratified by an Act of the Legislature of Arizona, within three years from the date hereof, and further, unless within three years from the date hereof the Colorado River Compact is unconditionally ratified by Arizona. When both ratifications are effective, this contract shall be effective.

INTEREST IN CONTRACT NOT TRANSFERABLE

15. No interest in or under this contract, except as provided by Article 7(l), shall be transferable by either party without the written consent of the other.

APPROPRIATION CLAUSE

16. The performance of this contract by the United States is contingent upon Congress making the necessary appropriations for expenditures for the completion and the operation and maintenance of any dams, power plants or other works necessary to the carrying out of this contract, or upon the necessary allotments being made therefor by any authorized federal agency. No liability shall accrue against the United States, its officers, agents or employees by reason of the failure of Congress to make any such appropriations or of any federal agency to make such allotments.

MEMBER OF CONGRESS CLAUSE

17. No Member of or Delegate to Congress or Resident Commissioner shall be admitted to any share or part of this contract or to any benefit that may arise herefrom, but this restriction shall not be construed to extend to this contract if made with a corporation or company for its general benefit. DEFINITIONS

18. Wherever terms used herein are defined in Article II of the Colorado River Compact or in Section 12 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, such definitions shall apply in construing this contract.

Text of Colorado River Compact

The States of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, having resolved to enter into a compact under the Act of the Congress of the United States of America approved August 19, 1921 (42 Statutes at Large, Page 171) and the Acts of the Legislatures of the said States, have through their Governors appointed as their Commissioners:

who, after negotiations participated in by Herbert Hoover appointed by The President as the representative of the United States of America, have agreed upon the following articles:

ARTICLE I

The major purposes of this compact are to provide for the equitable division and apportionment of the use of the waters of the Colorado River System; to establish the relative importance of different beneficial uses of water; to promote interstate comity; to remove causes of present and future controversies; and to secure the expeditious agricultural and industrial development of the Colorado River Basin, the storage of its waters and the protection of life and property from floods.  To these ends the Colorado River Basin is divided into two Basins, and an apportionment of the use of part of the water of the Colorado River System is made to each of them with the provision that further equitable apportionments may be made.

ARTICLE II

As used in this compact:--

(a) The term "Colorado River System" means that portion of the Colorado River and its tributaries within the United States of America.

(b) The term "Colorado River Basin" means all of the drainage area of the Colorado River System and all other territory within the United States of America to which the waters of the Colorado River System shall be beneficially applied.

(c) The term "States of the Upper Division" means the States of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.

(d) The term "States of the Lower Division" means the States of Arizona, California and Nevada.

(e) The term "Lee Ferry" means a point in the main stream of the Colorado River one mile below the mouth of the Paria River.

(f) The term "Upper Basin" means those parts of the States of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming within and from which waters naturally drain into the Colorado River System above Lee Ferry, and also all parts of said States located without the drainage area of the Colorado River System which are now or shall hereafter be beneficially served by waters diverted from the System above Lee Ferry.

(g) The term "Lower Basin" means those parts of the States of Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah within and from which waters naturally drain into the Colorado River System below Lee Ferry, and also all parts of said States located without the drainage area of the Colorado River System which are now or shall hereafter be beneficially served by waters diverted from the System below Lee Ferry.

(h) The term "domestic use" shall include the use of water for household, stock, municipal, mining, milling, industrial and other like purposes, but shall exclude the generation of electrical power.

ARTICLE III

(a) There is hereby apportioned from the Colorado River System in perpetuity to the Upper Basin and to the Lower Basin respectively the exclusive beneficial consumptive use of 7,500,000 acre feet of water per annum, which shall include all water necessary for the supply of any rights which may now exist.

(b) In addition to the apportionment in paragraph (a), the Lower Basin is hereby given the right to increase its beneficial consumptive use of such waters by one million acre feet per annum.

(c) If, as a matter of international comity, the United States of America shall hereafter recognize in the United States of Mexico any right to the use of any waters of the Colorado River System, such waters shall be supplied first from the waters which are surplus over and above the aggregate of the quantities specified in paragraphs (a) and (b); and if such surplus shall prove insufficient for this purpose, then, the burden of such deficiency shall be equally borne by the Upper Basin and the Lower Basin, and whenever necessary the States of the Upper Division shall deliver at Lee Ferry water to supply one-half of the deficiency so recognized in addition to that provided in paragraph (d).

(d) The States of the Upper Division will not cause the flow of the river at Lee Ferry to be depleted below an aggregate of 75,000,000 acre feet for any period of ten consecutive years reckoned in continuing progressive series beginning with the first day of October next succeeding the ratification of this compact.

(e) The States of the Upper Division shall not withhold water, and the States of the Lower Division shall not require the delivery of water, which cannot reasonably be applied to domestic and agricultural uses.

(f) Further equitable apportionment of the beneficial uses of the waters of the Colorado River System unapportioned by paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) may be made in the manner provided in paragraph (g) at any time after October first, 1963, if and when either Basin shall have reached its total beneficial consumptive use as set out in paragraphs (a) and (b).

(g) In the event of a desire for a further apportionment as provided in paragraph (f) any two signatory States, acting through their Governors, may give joint notice of such desire to the Governors of the other signatory States and to The President of the United States of America, and it shall be the duty of the Governors of the signatory States and of The President of the United States of America forthwith to appoint representatives, whose duty it shall be to divide and apportion equitably between the Upper Basin and Lower Basin the beneficial use of the unapportioned water of the Colorado River System as mentioned in paragraph (f), subject to the legislative ratification of the signatory States and the Congress of the United States of America.

ARTICLE IV

(a) Inasmuch as the Colorado River has ceased to be navigable for commerce and the reservation of its waters for navigation would seriously limit the development of its Basin, the use of its waters for purposes of navigation shall be subservient to the uses of such waters for domestic, agricultural and power purposes. If the Congress shall not consent to this paragraph, the other provisions of this compact shall nevertheless remain binding.

(b) Subject to the provisions of this compact, water of the Colorado River System may be impounded and used for the generation of electrical power, but such impounding and use shall be subservient to the use and consumption of such water for agricultural and domestic purposes and shall not interfere with or prevent use for such dominant purposes.

(c) The provisions of this article shall not apply to or interfere with the regulation and control by any State within its boundaries of the appropriation, use and distribution of water.

ARTICLE V

The chief official of each signatory State charged with the administration of water rights, together with the Director of the United States Reclamation Service and the Director of the United States Geological Survey shall cooperate, ex officio:

(a) To promote the systematic determination and co-ordination of the facts as to flow, appropriation, consumption and use of water in the Colorado River Basin, and the interchange of available information in such matters.

(b) To secure the ascertainment and publication of the annual flow of the Colorado River at Lee Ferry.

(c) To perform such other duties as may be assigned by mutual consent of the signatories from time to time.

ARTICLE VI

Should any claim or controversy arise between any two or more of the signatory States:  (a) with respect to the waters of the Colorado River System not covered by the terms of this compact; (b) over the meaning or performance of any of the terms of this compact; (c) as to the allocation of the burdens incident to the performance of any article of this compact or the delivery of waters as herein provided; (d) as to the construction or operation of works within the Colorado River Basin to be situated in two or more States, or to be constructed in one State for the benefit of another State; or (e) as to the diversion of water in one State for the benefit of another State; the Governors of the States affected, upon the request of one of them, shall forthwith appoint Commissioners with power to consider and adjust such claim or controversy, subject to ratification by the Legislatures of the States so affected.

Nothing herein contained shall prevent the adjustment of any such claim or controversy by any present method or by direct future legislative action of the interested States.

ARTICLE VII

Nothing in this compact shall be construed as affecting the obligations of the United States of America to Indian tribes.

ARTICLE VIII

Present perfected rights to the beneficial use of waters of the Colorado River System are unimpaired by this compact.  Whenever storage capacity of 5,000,000 acre feet shall have been provided on the main Colorado River within or for the benefit of the Lower Basin, then claims of such rights, if any, by appropriators or users of water in the Lower Basin against appropriators or users of water in the Upper Basin shall attach to and be satisfied from water that may be stored not in conflict with Article III.

All other rights to beneficial use of waters of the Colorado River System shall be satisfied solely from the water apportioned to that Basin in which they are situate.

ARTICLE IX

Nothing in this compact shall be construed to limit or prevent any State from instituting or maintaining any action or proceeding, legal or equitable, for the protection of any right under this compact or the enforcement of any of its provisions.

ARTICLE X

This compact may be terminated at any time by the unanimous agreement of the signatory States.  In the event of such termination all rights established under it shall continue unimpaired.

ARTICLE XI

This compact shall become binding and obligatory when it shall have been approved by the Legislatures of each of the signatory States and by the Congress of the United States.  Notice of approval by the Legislatures shall be given by the Governor of each signatory State to the Governors of the other signatory States and to the President of the United States, and the President of the United States is requested to give notice to the Governors of the signatory States of approval by the Congress of the United States.

(b) If any State or States of the Upper Division, in the ten years immediately preceding the water year in which curtailment is necessary, shall have consumptively used more water than it was or they were, as the case may be, entitled to use under the apportionment made by Article III of this Compact, such State or States shall be required to supply at Lee Ferry a quantity of water equal to its, or the aggregate of their, overdraft or the proportionate part of such overdraft, as may be necessary to assure compliance with Article III of the Colorado River Compact, before demand is made on any other State of the Upper Division;

(c) Except as provided in subparagraph (b) of this Article, the extent of curtailment by each State of the Upper Division of the consumptive use of water apportioned to it by Article III of this Compact shall be such as to result in the delivery at Lee Ferry of a quantity of water which bears the same relation to the total required curtailment of use by the States of the Upper Division as the consumptive use of Upper Colorado River System water which was made by each such State during the water year immediately preceding the year in which the curtailment becomes necessary bears to the total consumptive use of such water in the States of the Upper Division during the same water year; provided, that in determining such relation the uses of water under rights perfected prior to November 24, 1922, shall be excluded.

ARTICLE V

(a) All losses of water occurring from or as the result of the storage of water in reservoirs constructed prior to the signing of this Compact shall be charged to the State in which such reservoir or reservoirs are located. Water stored in reservoirs covered by this paragraph (a) shall be for the exclusive use of and shall be charged to the State in which the reservoir or reservoirs are located.

(b) All losses of water occurring from or as the result of the storage of water in reservoirs constructed after the signing of this Compact shall be charged as follows:

(1) If the Commission finds that the reservoir is used, in whole or in part, to assist the States of the Upper Division in meeting their obligations to deliver water at Lee Ferry imposed by Article III of the Colorado River Compact, the Commission shall make findings, which in no event shall be contrary to the laws of the United States of America under which any reservoir is constructed, as to the reservoir capacity allocated for that purpose.  The whole or that proportion, as the case may be, of reservoir losses as found by the Commission to be reasonably and properly chargeable to the reservoir or reservoir capacity utilized to assure deliveries at Lee Ferry shall be charged to the States of the Upper Division in the proportion which the consumptive use of water in each State of the Upper Division during the water year in which the charge is made bears to the total consumptive use of water in all States of the Upper Division during the same water year. Water stored in reservoirs or in reservoir capacity covered by this subparagraph (b) (1) shall be for the common benefit of all of the States of the Upper Division.

(2) If the Commission finds that the reservoir is used, in whole or in part, to supply water for use in a State of the Upper Division, the Commission shall make findings, which in no event shall be contrary to the laws of the United States of America under which any reservoir is constructed, as to the reservoir or reservoir capacity utilized to supply water for use and the State in which such water will be used. The whole or that proportion, as the case may be, of reservoir losses as found by the Commission to be reasonably and properly chargeable to the State in which such water will be used shall be borne by that State. As determined by the Commission, water stored in reservoirs covered by this subparagraph (b) (2) shall be earmarked for and charged to the State in which the water will be used.

(c) In the event the Commission finds that a reservoir site is available both to assure deliveries at Lee Ferry and to store water for consumptive use in a State of the Upper Division, the storage of water for consumptive use shall be given preference. Any reservoir or reservoir capacity hereafter used to assure deliveries at Lee Ferry shall by order of the Commission be used to store water for consumptive use in a State, provided the Commission finds that such storage is reasonably necessary to permit such State to make the use of the water apportioned to it by this Compact.

ARTICLE VI

The Commission shall determine the quantity of the consumptive use of water, which use is apportioned by Article III hereof, for the Upper Basin and for each State of the Upper Basin by the inflow-outflow method in terms of man-made depletions of the virgin flow at Lee Ferry, unless the Commission, by unanimous action, shall adopt a different method of determination.

ARTICLE VII

The consumptive use of water by the United States of America or any of its agencies, instrumentalities or wards shall be charged as a use by the State in which the use is made; provided, that such consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding, or conveyance of water in one State for use in another shall be charged to such latter State.

ARTICLE VIII

(a) There is hereby created an interstate administrative agency to be known as the "Upper Colorado River Commission." The Commission shall be composed of one Commissioner representing each of the States of the Upper Division, namely, the States of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, designated or appointed in accordance with the laws of each such State and, if designated by the president, one Commissioner representing the United States of America.  The president is hereby requested to designate a Commissioner.  If so designated the Commissioner representing the United States of America shall be the presiding officer of the Commission and shall be entitled to the same powers and rights as the Commissioner of any State. Any four members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum.

On or before December 1 of each year, the Commission shall adopt and transmit to the Governors of the four States and to the president a budget covering an estimate of its expenses for the following year, and of the amount payable by each State. Each State shall pay the amount due by it to the Commission on or before April 1 of the year following. The payment of the expenses of the Commission and of its employees shall not be subject to the audit and accounting procedures of any of the four States; however, all receipts and disbursement of funds handled by the Commission shall be audited yearly by a qualified independent public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become a part of the annual report of the Commission.

(c) The Commission shall appoint a Secretary, who shall not be a member of the Commission, or an employee of any signatory State or of the United States of America while so acting. He shall serve for such term and receive such salary and perform such duties as the Commission may direct. The Commission may employ such engineering, legal, clerical and other personnel as, in its judgment, may be necessary for the performance of its functions under this Compact.

ARTICLE IX

(a) No State shall deny the right of the United States of America and, subject to the conditions hereinafter contained, no State shall deny the right of another signatory State, any person, or entity of any signatory State to acquire rights to the use of water, or to construct or participate in the construction and use of diversion works and storage reservoirs with appurtenant works, canals and conduits in one State for the purpose of diverting, conveying, storing, regulating and releasing water to satisfy the provisions of the Colorado River Compact relating to the obligation of the States of the Upper Division to make deliveries of water at Lee Ferry, or for the purpose of diverting, conveying, storing or regulating water in an upper signatory State for consumptive use in a lower signatory State, when such use is within the apportionment to such lower State made by this Compact. Such rights shall be subject to the rights of water users, in a State in which such reservoir or works are located, to receive and use water, the use of which is within the apportionment to such State by this Compact.

(b) Any signatory State, any person or any entity of any signatory State shall have the right to acquire such property rights as are necessary to the use of water in conformity with this Compact in any other signatory State by donation, purchase or through the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Any signatory State, upon the written request of the Governor of any other signatory State, for the benefit of whose water users property is to be acquired in the State to which such written request is made, shall proceed expeditiously to acquire the desired property either by purchase at a price satisfactory to the requesting State, or, if such purchase cannot be made, then through the exercise of its power of eminent domain and shall convey such property to the requesting State or such entity as may be designated by the requesting State; provided, that all costs of acquisition and expenses of every kind and nature whatsoever incurred in obtaining the requested property shall be paid by the requesting State at the time and in the manner prescribed by the State requested to acquire the property.

(c) Should any facility be constructed in a signatory State by and for the benefit of another signatory State or States or the water users thereof, as above provided, the construction, repair, replacement, maintenance and operation of such facility shall be subject to the laws of the State in which the facility is located, except that, in the case of a reservoir constructed in one State for the benefit of another State or States, the water administration officials of the State in which the facility is located shall permit the storage and release of any water which, as determined by findings of the Commission, falls within the apportionment of the State or States for whose benefit the facility is constructed. In the case of a regulating reservoir for the joint benefit of all States in making Lee Ferry deliveries, the water administration officials of the State in which the facility is located, in permitting the storage and release of water, shall comply with the findings and orders of the Commission.

(d) In the event property is acquired by a signatory State in another signatory State for the use and benefit of the former, the users of water made available by such facilities, as a condition precedent to the use thereof, shall pay to the political subdivisions of the State in which such works are located, each and every year during which such rights are enjoyed for such purposes, a sum of money equivalent to the average annual amount of taxes levied and assessed against the land and improvements thereon during the ten years preceding the acquisition of such land. Said payments shall be in full reimbursement for the loss of taxes in such political subdivisions of the State, and in lieu of any and all taxes on said property, improvements and rights. The signatory States recommend to the president and the Congress that, in the event the United States of America shall acquire property in one of the signatory States for the benefit of another signatory State, or its water users, provision be made for like payment in reimbursement of loss of taxes.

(c) The uses of the waters of the San Juan River and any of its tributaries within either State which are dependent upon a common source of water and which are not covered by (a) hereof, shall in times of water shortages be reduced in such quantity that the resulting consumptive use in each State will bear the same proportionate relation to the consumptive use made in each State during times of average water supply as determined by the Commission; provided, that any preferential uses of water to which Indians are entitled under Article XIX shall be excluded in determining the amount of curtailment to be made under this paragraph.

(d) The curtailment of water use by either State in order to make deliveries at Lee Ferry as required by Article IV of this Compact shall be independent of any and all conditions imposed by this Article and shall be made by each State, as and when required, without regard to any provision of this Article.

(e) All consumptive use of the waters of the San Juan River and its tributaries shall be charged under the apportionment of Article III hereof to the State in which the use is made; provided, that consumptive use incident to the diversion, impounding or conveyance of water in one State for use in the other shall be charged to the latter State.

ARTICLE XV

(a) Subject to the provisions of the Colorado River Compact and of this Compact, water of the Upper Colorado River System may be impounded and used for the generation of electrical power, but such impounding and use shall be subservient to the use and consumption of such water for agricultural and domestic purposes and shall not interfere with or prevent use for such dominant purposes.

#### Section 45-2244. Acquisition and disposition of initial quantity of water

A. The authority, acting through its board, shall apportion the rights to the delivery of the first eighteen thousand five hundred acre-feet per year of Colorado river water that it obtains as follows:

1. The right to the delivery of fifteen thousand acre-feet per year of Colorado river water shall be apportioned by subcontract and made available to authority members for municipal uses.

2. The right to the delivery of three thousand five hundred acre-feet per year of Colorado river water shall be apportioned by subcontract and made available for industrial uses.

3. Notwithstanding the apportionment to municipal and industrial uses as prescribed by paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, Colorado river water may be made available by the authority for industrial, agricultural or miscellaneous uses as prescribed by subsection F of this section until that water is needed for municipal or industrial uses.

B. The authority, acting through its board, shall make available Colorado river water that is apportioned for municipal uses as prescribed by subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section to authority members through subcontracts between the authority and the authority member for the sale and delivery of Colorado river water. The term of these subcontracts may be coextensive with the term of the contract with the United States pursuant to which the authority obtains the Colorado river water or the duration of the subcontracts may be for a lesser term. The rate charged for the Colorado river water made available to the authority members for municipal uses may be fixed for all or part of the subcontract term but shall be established by subcontract to permit the authority member to provide the water to its customers at a reasonable cost as determined by the authority in the exercise of its discretion. Any subcontract may require the authority member to pay water supply fees or to assess and share the cost of water supply fees with the authority. Water supply fees include standby or holding charges, development impact fees, connection fees, extraction fees, user fees, administrative fees, other fees or charges that the subcontract requires and the member collects for new uses to be served with the water made available pursuant to subcontract or any other fees that the authority determines to be necessary or prudent to fund the acquisition of replacement supplies of water. Any such fees assessed or collected by the authority member shall be remitted to the authority and deposited in the funds of the authority as provided in this chapter.

C. The Colorado river water apportioned for municipal uses under subsection B of this section shall be served by the authority member within the service area established for the authority member in any water service contract between the authority member and the United States. The Colorado river water so apportioned may not be served to any single industrial user for manufacturing purposes, processing purposes or thermoelectric power generation, with a demand greater than two hundred fifty acre-feet per year until the end of the seventh year after the authority is formed.

D. If Colorado river water that is made available to authority members for municipal uses pursuant to subsection B of this section is not subcontracted for by authority members within one year of the authority's formation pursuant to section 45-2202, subsection C, the Colorado river water may be made available by subcontract to other municipal water providers in the county in which the authority is formed on terms consistent with this section.

E. The authority shall make Colorado river water that is apportioned for industrial uses as provided in subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section available to applicants through subcontracts for the sale and delivery of that water. The term of the subcontracts shall be set by the authority and may be coextensive with the term of the contract with the United States pursuant to which the authority obtains the Colorado river water. The rate charged for Colorado river water made available to applicants for industrial uses may be established by subcontract or by tariff set by the authority. The rate charged may vary or may be fixed for all or a part of the subcontract term. The initial rate charged per acre-foot shall not be less than the rate charged per acre-foot by a multi-county water conservation district, or its successors, for the capital and fixed operation and maintenance charges associated with an acre-foot of central Arizona project municipal and industrial water in the year in which the authority subcontracts for the sale and delivery of the water.

F. Notwithstanding the apportionment to municipal and industrial uses as provided in subsection A, paragraphs 1 and 2 of this section, the authority may subcontract for the delivery of Colorado river water for industrial, agricultural or miscellaneous uses for which subcontracts have not been executed as provided in subsections B and E of this section or for which subcontracts have been executed as provided in subsections B and E of this section if there is no current demand for the water by the subcontractors. A subcontract for the delivery of Colorado river water for an industrial, agricultural or miscellaneous use under this subsection shall not be for a term of more than five years. A subcontract under this subsection may serve an existing use of Colorado river water which was not supported by a contract for the delivery of Colorado river water on January 1, 1994, or a new use of Colorado river water initiated after January 1, 1994. A subcontract under this subsection shall be subject to the approval of subcontractors with subcontracts entered into pursuant to subsection B of this section. Any subcontract under this subsection shall impose the charge per acre-foot of Colorado river water delivered that the authority in its discretion determines to be adequate. Any subcontract under this subsection may be renewed or extended successively for the same or a shorter period of time. For purposes of this subsection, "miscellaneous use" means a use of water for recreational or fish and wildlife purposes.

G. The authority may accept transfers of the Colorado river water entitlements of its members and may contract with the United States for the delivery to the authority of the initial eighteen thousand five hundred acre-feet a year of Colorado river water obtained by the authority. The authority may contract with the United States for the delivery of any additional amounts of water obtained by the authority from its members and may contract as provided in section 45-2245.

H. Any subcontract under this section shall require the Colorado river water delivered pursuant to the subcontract to be used in the county in which the authority is formed.

#### Section 45-2245. Acquisition and disposition of water in excess of initial quantity

A. The authority may contract with the United States for the delivery of Colorado river water in excess of the initial eighteen thousand five hundred acre-feet a year that the United States makes available to the authority.

B. The authority may apportion Colorado river water, water credits or effluent that it obtains in excess of the initial eighteen thousand five hundred acre-feet a year between municipal and industrial uses in the manner that the authority determines to be appropriate after considering the water needs of the county in which the authority is formed.

C. The authority may contract with a multi-county water conservation district or its successors or with subcontractors of a multi-county water conservation district or their successors for the delivery to the authority of Colorado river water available to the central Arizona project.

D. The authority may purchase, lease, sever, transfer or retire water rights to the Colorado river in this state.

E. The authority may lease Colorado river water apportioned to this state from Indian tribes that are entitled by decree to that water and whose reservations are located in the lower basin of the Colorado river system in this state.

F. The authority may store, recharge and recover any water or effluent available to the authority to the extent allowed under any provision of chapter 3.1 of this title and may enter into exchanges of water or of water credits within or outside the county in which the authority is formed to the extent allowed under any provision of chapter 4 of this title.

G. The authority may contract for the storage or recovery of effluent to the extent allowed under any provision of chapter 3.1 of this title and may contract for the delivery or purchase of effluent.

H. Under terms specified by the authority and subject to subsection B, the authority may enter into subcontracts with authority members and other water providers in the county where the authority is formed for the sale, exchange or other disposition of Colorado river water, water credits or effluent acquired by the authority pursuant to this section. In connection with those subcontracts, the authority may charge or impose standby or holding charges, development impact fees, connection fees, extraction fees, user fees, administrative fees or any other fees or charges that the authority determines to be necessary to recover the authority's costs of making the water, water credits or effluent available under the subcontract. The authority may impose additional fees or charges as the authority determines to be necessary or prudent to fund the acquisition of replacement supplies of water for the authority.

I. Any subcontract under this section shall require Colorado river water delivered pursuant to the subcontract to be used in the county in which the authority is formed.

## Chapter 14 - ARIZONA WATER BANKING AUTHORITY

### Article 1 - General Provisions

#### Section 45-2401. Declaration of policy and purpose

A. The legislature finds that this state is currently and temporarily underutilizing both the entitlement to Colorado river water confirmed to it by the United States supreme court in Arizona v. California, 373 U.S. 546 (1963), and the central Arizona project, which has the capacity to divert into this state a significant portion of this state's entitlement to Colorado river water. The legislature further finds that, due to the low priority on the Colorado river of the central Arizona project and other Arizona Colorado river water users, the susceptibility of this state to future shortages of water on the Colorado river is a threat to the general economy and welfare of this state and its citizens.

B. The legislature further finds that water users within the central Arizona project service area also rely on other surface water supplies, that these supplies are susceptible to future shortages of water and that these shortages are a threat to the general economy and welfare of this state and its citizens.

C. The legislature further finds that future water needs in the states of California and Nevada could exceed the entitlements of those states to Colorado river water. Those future water needs could thereby affect the general economy and welfare of this state and its citizens because of the close economic ties among Arizona, California and Nevada.

D. The legislature further finds that Arizona water users could more efficiently manage, distribute and use available water resources through the storage of water supplies and through stored water lending arrangements, but that not all of these Arizona water users have the opportunities or resources needed to store water or enter into stored water lending arrangements.

E. The legislature further finds that for the purposes of this chapter diverting Colorado river water for storage off of the Colorado river system is a consumptive use of that water.

F. The legislature further finds that water banking is complimentary and compatible with existing water management efforts. The Arizona water banking authority will compliment and assist the activities of the central Arizona water conservation district in its mission to provide a dependable and cost-effective water supply.

G. The legislature therefore finds that it is in the best interest of the general economy and welfare of this state and its citizens to:

1. Use the central Arizona project to store otherwise unused Arizona entitlement to Colorado river water within this state to meet future water needs within this state.

2. Provide the opportunity to the states of California and Nevada to store currently unused Colorado river water in Arizona to meet future needs in those states.

3. Provide the opportunity to facilitate the storage of water and stored water lending arrangements by entities in Arizona that may not have the opportunities or resources needed to store water.

4. Provide the opportunity to facilitate the settlement of Indian water rights claims by delivering and storing water.

H. The public policy and general purposes of this chapter are to:

1. Increase utilization of Arizona's Colorado river entitlement that was confirmed to Arizona by the United States supreme court in article ii(b)(1), (2) and (6) of the decree entered at Arizona v. California, 376 U.S. 340 (1964), and that would otherwise be unused in Arizona, by delivering that water into this state through the central Arizona project aqueducts.

2. Store water brought into this state through the central Arizona project to protect Arizona municipal and industrial water users against future water shortages on the Colorado river and disruptions of operation of the central Arizona project.

3. Store water brought into this state through the central Arizona project to fulfill the water management objectives of this state set forth in chapter 2 of this title.

4. Provide the opportunity for storing water brought into this state through the central Arizona project to be available to implement the settlement of water right claims by Indian communities within Arizona.

5. Provide the opportunity to authorized agencies in the states of California and Nevada to store otherwise unused Colorado river water in Arizona to assist those states in meeting future water needs.

6. Provide the opportunity to facilitate the storage of water and stored water lending arrangements by entities in Arizona that may not have the opportunities or resources needed to store water.

 

#### Section 45-2402. Definitions

Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms defined in sections 45-101, 45-402 and 45-802.01 have the same meaning in this chapter and for purposes of this chapter:

8. "Water banking services" means services provided by the authority to persons and Indian communities in this state to facilitate for those persons and Indian communities storage of water and stored water lending arrangements.  Water banking services include the direct delivery of water to Indian communities in this state in replacement of or supplemental to the accrual of long-term storage credits pursuant to article 5 of this chapter.

6. The director shall calculate the irrigation replenishment obligation for the eastern protection zone north and the eastern protection zone south for the year as follows:

(a) Determine the total amount of underground water and stored water withdrawn during the year from within the eastern protection zone north and the eastern protection zone south and used for the irrigation of lands within those protection zones, as reported to the director on the annual reports required by section 45-632, section 45-875.01, subsection D and section 45-2602.  For the purposes of this subdivision, stored water does not include any water stored at a storage facility located within the eastern protection zone north or the eastern protection zone south.

(b) For each farm within the eastern protection zone north and the eastern protection zone south for which an annual report is filed under section 45-632, 45-875.01 or 45-2602 for the year, calculate the maximum amount of groundwater that may be used on the farm for irrigation purposes during the year without causing the flexibility account for the farm to be in arrears in excess of the amount allowed under section 45-467, subsection I. In making this calculation, the director shall use the irrigation water duty established for the farm for the third management period pursuant to section 45-566, subsection A, paragraph 1.

(c) Add together the amount calculated for each farm under subdivision (b) of this paragraph.

(d) Subtract the amount in subdivision (c) of this paragraph from the amount in subdivision (a) of this paragraph. The difference is the irrigation replenishment obligation for the year for the eastern protection zone north and the eastern protection zone south, except that if the difference is less than zero, there is no replenishment obligation.

7. Through 2023, the director shall calculate the water company replenishment obligation for the year by determining the amount of underground water and stored water withdrawn during the year from within the eastern protection zones by a water company and transported for municipal uses outside of the eastern protection zones and then subtracting from that amount one thousand two hundred seventy-five acre-feet.  The difference is the water company replenishment obligation for the year, except that if the difference is less than zero, there is no replenishment obligation.  For the purposes of this paragraph, stored water does not include any water stored at a storage facility located within an eastern protection zone and recovered within that protection zone.
