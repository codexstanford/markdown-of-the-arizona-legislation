All petitions submitted to the governing body within the twenty-day period for filing protests shall be transmitted to the director with the certified copy of the order.

D. If a person applies for a license to conduct a spirituous liquor business outside an incorporated city or town, the director shall remit the application to the clerk of the board of supervisors of the county where the applicant desires to do business, and the proceedings by the clerk and board of supervisors shall be as provided for cities and towns.

E. On receipt of an application for a spirituous liquor license, the director shall set the application for a hearing by the board on a date following the expiration of the time fixed for the submitting of the certified order by the governing body of the city or town or the board of supervisors. If the city or town or the county recommends approval of the license a hearing is not required unless the director, the board or any aggrieved party requests a hearing on the grounds that the public convenience and the best interest of the community will not be substantially served if a license is issued.  Any natural person residing or owning or leasing property within a one-mile radius of the proposed location may file a written protest with the director on a form prescribed by the director not later than fifteen calendar days after action by the local governing body or sixty days after the filing of the application, whichever is sooner. The director shall allow protests to be submitted by e-mail. The written argument shall contain the natural person's complete name, street address or post office box address and written or electronic signature.  If the written arguments are filed by a person on behalf of a corporation or other legal entity or association, the written arguments must be accompanied by a copy of the entity's organizing document, a designation of the office or position that the person holds within the organization and a copy of the written appointment of the person to speak on behalf of the organization. If the written arguments are filed by a neighborhood association, block watch or other unincorporated association, written arguments must be accompanied by a letter of authority designating that person as a spokesperson. If no hearing is requested by the director, the board or any aggrieved party, the application may be approved by the director.  If the recommendation is for disapproval of an application, the board shall hold a hearing.  If the city, town or county recommends approval of the license pursuant to subsection C of this section or makes no recommendation, the director may cancel the hearing and issue the license unless the board or any aggrieved party requests a hearing. If the reason for the protest is clearly removed or deemed satisfied by the director, the board shall cancel the hearing. If the board cancels the hearing, the department may administratively issue an order without the applicant licensee or other parties present. The certified order, the reasons contained in the order and the summary of the testimony and other evidence supporting the city, town or county disapproval of the recommendation shall be read into the record before the board and shall be considered as evidence by the board.  The board shall consider the certified order together with other facts and a report of the director relating to the qualifications of the applicant.  If the governing body of the city or town or the board of supervisors fails to return to the director, as provided in subsections C and D of this section, its order of disapproval, no hearing is required. An application shall be approved or disapproved within one hundred five days after the filing of the application.  If, after a hearing by the board where a license has been approved, a formal written order is not entered within thirty days after the hearing, the decision of the board is deemed entered on the thirtieth day after the hearing.

F. A hearing may be conducted by an administrative law judge at the request of the board to make findings and recommendations for use by the board in determining whether to grant or deny a license. The administrative law judge shall submit a report of findings to the board within twenty days after the hearing. The board may affirm, reverse, adopt, modify, supplement, amend or reject the administrative law judge's report in whole or in part.

G. Except for a person-to-person transfer of a transferable license for use at the same location and as otherwise provided in section 4-203, subsection A, in all proceedings before the governing body of a city or town, the board of supervisors of a county or the board, the applicant bears the burden of showing that the public convenience requires and that the best interest of the community will be substantially served by the issuance of a license.

H. In order to prevent the proliferation of spirituous liquor licenses the department may deny a license to a business on the grounds that the business is inappropriate for the sale of spirituous liquor.  An inappropriate business is one that cannot clearly demonstrate that the sale of spirituous liquor is directly connected to its primary purpose and that the sale of spirituous liquor is not merely incidental to its primary purpose.

I. The board shall adopt, by rule, guidelines that state criteria for use in determining whether the public convenience requires and the best interest of the community will be substantially served by the issuance or transfer of a liquor license at the location applied for. These guidelines shall govern the recommendations and other approvals of the department and the local governing authority.

J. If the governing body of a city or town recommends disapproval by a two-thirds vote of the members present and voting on an application for the issuance or transfer of a spirituous liquor license that, if approved, would result in a license being issued at a location either having no license or having a license of a different series, the application shall not be approved unless the board decides to approve the application by a two-thirds vote of the members present and voting.

#### Section 4-201.01. Extending time limits

A. In the event any decision, hearing, or other action by the department, including the board, is alleged to be untimely, an aggrieved person may file a demand that the department take action within fifteen days. In the event the department does not then act, the aggrieved person may file an action in superior court seeking an order requiring the department to act.

B. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section, if the director determines that it is in the public interest to extend the time limits for action by the department, including the board, in connection with a license issuance or transfer or acquisition of control, the director may extend the time limits by up to one hundred five days. The director may further extend the time limits as the director deems necessary if special circumstances such as litigation affecting the ownership of the license, bankruptcy, probate or other circumstances deemed meritorious by the director prevent the department from completing its action or the director requires additional time to complete an investigation of an applicant's qualifications for licensure pursuant to section 4-202. In no event shall the director extend the time limits more than one year except as necessary in the event of litigation affecting the ownership of the license, bankruptcy or probate or except on a written request of the applicant or licensee that the director determines is supported by good cause.

 

#### Section 4-202. Qualifications of licensees; application; background information; prior convictions

A. Every spirituous liquor licensee, other than a club licensee, a corporation licensee, a limited liability company licensee or an out-of-state licensee, shall be a citizen of the United States and a bona fide resident of this state or a legal resident alien who is a bona fide resident of this state.  If a partnership, each partner shall be a citizen of the United States and a bona fide resident of this state or a legal resident alien who is a bona fide resident of this state, except that for a limited partnership an individual general partner is required to meet the qualifications of an individual licensee, a corporate general partner is required to meet the qualifications of a corporate licensee and a limited partner is not required to be a citizen of the United States, a legal resident alien or a bona fide resident of this state. If a corporation or limited liability company, it shall be a domestic corporation or a foreign corporation or a limited liability company that has qualified to do business in this state.  A person shall hold a club license, corporation license, limited liability company license, partnership license or out-of-state license through an agent who shall be a natural person and meet the qualifications for licensure, except that an agent for an out-of-state license as specified in section 4-209, subsection B, paragraph 2 need not be a resident of this state. Notice of change of agent shall be filed with the director within thirty days after a change.  For the purposes of this subsection, "agent" means a person who is designated by an applicant or licensee to receive communications from the department and to file documents and sign documents for filing with the department on behalf of the applicant or licensee.

B. A person shall file an application for a spirituous liquor license on a form prescribed by the director. The director shall require any applicant and may require any controlling person, other than a bank or licensed lending institution, to furnish background information and to submit a full set of fingerprints to the department. The department of liquor licenses and control shall submit the fingerprints to the department of public safety for the purpose of obtaining a state and federal criminal records check pursuant to section 41-1750 and Public Law 92-544. The department of public safety may exchange this fingerprint data with the federal bureau of investigation. If a license is issued or transferred when fees are waived pursuant to section 4-209, subsection I, no additional background check is required if the person has already completed a background investigation in connection with the continuing business.

C. Each applicant or licensee shall designate a person who shall be responsible for managing the premises.  The designated person may be the applicant or licensee. The manager shall be a natural person and shall meet all the requirements for licensure. The same person may be designated as the manager for more than one premises owned by the same licensee. Notice of a change in the manager shall be filed with the director within thirty days after a change.

D. No license shall be issued to any person who, within one year before application, has had a license revoked. The director shall not issue an interim permit or restaurant license to any person who, at the same location, has been required to surrender a restaurant license pursuant to section 4-205.02, subsection D or section 4-213 until twelve months after the date of the surrender. No license shall be issued to or renewed for any person who, within five years before application, has been convicted of a felony, or convicted of an offense in another state that would be a felony in this state.  For a conviction of a corporation to be a basis for a denial under this section, the limitations that are provided in section 4-210, subsection A, paragraph 8 shall apply. No corporation shall have its annual license issued or renewed unless it has on file with the department a list of its officers and directors and any stockholders who own ten percent or more of the corporation.

E. The department of liquor licenses and control shall receive criminal history record information from the department of public safety for applicants for employment with the department of liquor licenses and control or for a license issued by the department of liquor licenses and control.

F. The department shall not issue or renew a license for any person who on the request of the director fails to provide the department with complete financial disclosure statements indicating all financial holdings of the person or any other person in or relating to the license applied for, including all cosignatories on financial holdings, land, buildings, leases or other forms of indebtedness that the applicant has incurred or will incur.

 

#### Section 4-203. Licenses; issuance; transfer; reversion to state

A. A spirituous liquor license shall be issued only after satisfactory showing of the capability, qualifications and reliability of the applicant and, with the exception of wholesaler, producer, government or club licenses, that the public convenience requires and that the best interest of the community will be substantially served by the issuance. If an application is filed for the issuance of a transferable or nontransferable license, other than for a craft distiller license, a microbrewery license or a farm winery license, for a location that on the date the application is filed has a valid license of the same series, or in the case of a restaurant license application filed for a location with a valid hotel-motel license, issued at that location, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the public convenience and best interest of the community at that location was established at the time the location was previously licensed. The presumption may be rebutted by competent contrary evidence. The presumption shall not apply once the licensed location has not been in use for more than one hundred eighty days and the presumption shall not extend to the personal qualifications of the applicant.

B. The license shall be to manufacture, sell or deal in spirituous liquors only at the place and in the manner provided in the license. A separate license shall be issued for each specific business, and each shall specify:

1. The particular spirituous liquors that the licensee is authorized to manufacture, sell or deal in.

2. The place of business for which issued.

3. The purpose for which the liquors may be manufactured or sold.

C. A spirituous liquor license issued to a bar, a liquor store or a beer and wine bar shall be transferable as to any permitted location within the same county, if the transfer meets the requirements of an original application.  A spirituous liquor license may be transferred to a person qualified to be a licensee, if the transfer is pursuant to either judicial decree, nonjudicial foreclosure of a legal or equitable lien, including security interests held by financial institutions pursuant to section 4-205.05, a sale of the license, a bona fide sale of the entire business and stock in trade, or other bona fide transactions that are provided for by rule. Any change in ownership of the business of a licensee, directly or indirectly, as defined by rule is deemed a transfer, except that there is no transfer if a new artificial person is added to the ownership of a licensee's business but the controlling persons remain identical to the controlling persons that have been previously disclosed to the director as part of the licensee's existing ownership.

D. All applications for a new license pursuant to section 4-201 or for a transfer to a new location pursuant to subsection C of this section shall be filed with and determined by the director, except when the governing body of the city or town or the board of supervisors receiving an application pursuant to section 4-201 orders disapproval of the application or when the director, the state liquor board or any aggrieved party requests a hearing. The application shall then be presented to the state liquor board, and the new license or transfer shall not become effective unless approved by the state liquor board.

E. A person who assigns, surrenders, transfers or sells control of a liquor license or business that has a spirituous liquor license shall notify the director within thirty business days after the assignment, surrender, transfer or sale. A spirituous liquor license shall not be leased or subleased. A concession agreement entered into under section 4-205.03 is not considered a lease or sublease in violation of this section.

F. If a person other than those persons originally licensed acquires control over a license or licensee, the person shall file notice of the acquisition with the director within thirty business days after the acquisition of control and a list of officers, directors or other controlling persons on a form prescribed by the director. There is no acquisition of control if a new person is added to the ownership of a licensee's business but the controlling persons remain identical to the controlling persons that have been previously disclosed to the director as part of the licensee's existing ownership.  All officers, directors or other controlling persons shall meet the qualifications for licensure as prescribed by this title. On request, the director shall conduct a preinvestigation before the assignment, sale or transfer of control of a license or licensee, the reasonable costs of which, not more than $1,000, shall be borne by the applicant. The preinvestigation shall determine whether the qualifications for licensure as prescribed by this title are met. On receipt of notice of an acquisition of control or request of a preinvestigation, the director, within fifteen days after receipt, shall forward the notice of the acquisition of control to the local governing body of the city or town, if the licensed premises is in an incorporated area, or the county, if the licensed premises is in an unincorporated area. The director shall include in the notice to the local governing body written instructions on how the local governing body may examine, free of charge, the results of the department's investigation regarding the capabilities, qualifications and reliability of all officers, directors or other controlling persons listed in the application for acquisition of control. The local governing body, or the governing body's designee, may provide the director with a recommendation, either in favor of or against the acquisition of control, within sixty days after the director mails the notice, but section 4-201 does not apply to the acquisition of control provided for in this section.  A local governing body may charge not more than one fee, regardless of the number of licenses held by the applicant, for review of one or more applications for acquisition of control submitted to the department at the same time and for the same entity.  Within one hundred five days after filing the notice of the acquisition of control, the director shall determine whether the applicant is qualified, capable and reliable for licensure. A recommendation by the local governing body, or the governing body's designee, against the acquisition of control or denial by the director shall be set for a hearing before the board. The person who has acquired control of a license or licensee has the burden of an original application at the hearing, and the board shall make its determination pursuant to section 4-202 and this section with respect to capability, reliability and qualification.

G. A licensee who holds a license in nonuse status for more than five months shall be required to pay a $100 surcharge for each month thereafter. The surcharge shall be paid at the time the license is returned to active status.  A license automatically reverts to the state after being held in continuous nonuse for more than thirty-six months. The director may waive the surcharge and may extend the time period provided in this subsection for good cause if the licensee files a written request for an extension of time to place the license in active status before the date of the automatic reversion. Unless the reverted license of the licensee has been subsequently reissued, the director shall relieve a licensee or its legal representative from a prior license reversion under this section if the request for such relief is filed in writing not later than two years after the date of reversion.  A license shall not be deemed to have gone into active status if the license is transferred to a location that at the time of or immediately before the transfer had an active license of the same type, unless the licenses are under common ownership or control.

H. A restructuring of a licensee's business is not an acquisition of control, a transfer of a spirituous liquor license or the issuance of a new spirituous liquor license if both of the following apply:

1. All of the controlling persons of the licensee and the new business entity are identical.

2. There is no change in control or beneficial ownership.

I. If subsection H of this section applies, the licensee's history of violations of this title is the history of the new business entity. The director may prescribe a form and shall require the applicant to provide the necessary information to ensure compliance with this subsection and subsections F and G of this section.

J. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, the holder of a retail license in this state having off-sale privileges, except a bar, beer and wine bar or restaurant licensee, may take orders by telephone, mail, fax or catalog, through the internet or by other means for the sale and delivery of spirituous liquor off of the licensed premises to a person in this state in connection with the sale of spirituous liquor. Notwithstanding the definition of "sell" prescribed in section 4-101, the placement of an order and payment pursuant to this section is not a sale until delivery has been made.  At the time that the order is placed, the licensee shall inform the purchaser that state law requires a purchaser of spirituous liquor to be at least twenty-one years of age and that the person accepting delivery of the spirituous liquor is required to comply with this state's age identification requirements as prescribed in section 4-241, subsections A and K. The licensee may maintain a delivery service and may contract with one or more independent contractors, that may also contract with one or more independent contractors, or may contract with a common carrier for delivery of spirituous liquor if the spirituous liquor is loaded for delivery at the premises of the retail licensee in this state and delivered in this state.  Except if the person delivering the order has personally retrieved and bagged or otherwise packaged the container of spirituous liquor for delivery and the licensee records, or requires to be recorded electronically, the identification information for each delivery, all containers of spirituous liquor delivered pursuant to this subsection shall be conspicuously labeled with the words "contains alcohol, signature of person who is twenty-one years of age or older is required for delivery". The licensee is responsible for any violation of this title or any rule adopted pursuant to this title that is committed in connection with any sale or delivery of spirituous liquor. Delivery must be made by an employee of the licensee or other authorized person as provided by this section who is at least twenty-one years of age to a customer who is at least twenty-one years of age and who displays an identification at the time of delivery that complies with section 4-241, subsection K. The retail licensee shall collect payment for the full price of the spirituous liquor from the purchaser before the product leaves the licensed premises. The director shall adopt rules that set operational limits for the delivery of spirituous liquors by the holder of a retail license having off-sale privileges. With respect to the delivery of spirituous liquor, for any violation of this title or any rule adopted pursuant to this title that is based on the act or omission of a licensee's employee or other authorized person, the mitigation provision of section 4-210, subsection G applies, with the exception of the training requirement. For the purposes of this subsection and notwithstanding the definition of "sell" prescribed in section 4-101, section 4-241, subsections A and K apply only at the time of delivery. For the purposes of compliance with this subsection, an independent contractor, a subcontractor of an independent contractor, the employee of an independent contractor or the employee of a subcontractor is deemed to be acting on behalf of the licensee when making a delivery of spirituous liquor for the licensee.

K. Except as provided in subsection J of this section, Arizona licensees may transport spirituous liquors for themselves in vehicles owned, leased or rented by the licensee.

L. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, an off-sale retail licensee may provide consumer tasting of wines off of the licensed premises subject to all applicable provisions of section 4-206.01.

M. The director may adopt reasonable rules to protect the public interest and prevent abuse by licensees of the activities permitted such licensees by subsections J and L of this section.

N. Failure to pay any surcharge prescribed by subsection G of this section or failure to report the period of nonuse of a license shall be grounds for revocation of the license or grounds for any other sanction provided by this title. The director may consider extenuating circumstances if control of the license is acquired by another party in determining whether or not to impose any sanctions under this subsection.

O. If a licensed location has not been in use for three years, the location must requalify for a license pursuant to subsection A of this section and shall meet the same qualifications required for issuance of a new license except when the director deems that the nonuse of the location was due to circumstances beyond the licensee's control and an extension of time has been granted pursuant to subsection G of this section.

P. If the licensee's interest is forfeited pursuant to section 4-210, subsection L, the location shall requalify for a license pursuant to subsection A of this section and shall meet the same qualifications required for issuance of a new license except when a bona fide lienholder demonstrates mitigation pursuant to section 4-210, subsection K.

Q. The director may implement a procedure for the issuance of a license with a licensing period of two years.

R. For any sale of a farm winery or craft distiller or change in ownership of a farm winery or craft distiller directly or indirectly, the business, stock-in-trade and spirituous liquor may be transferred with the ownership, in compliance with the applicable requirements of this title.

S. Notwithstanding subsection B of this section, bar, beer and wine bar, liquor store, beer and wine store or restaurant licensees in this state may take orders by telephone, mail, fax or catalog, through the internet or by other means for the sale and delivery of spirituous liquor off the licensed premises as follows:

1. Bar licensees for beer, wine, distilled spirits and mixed cocktails.

2. Beer and wine bar licensees for beer and wine.

3. Liquor store licensees for beer, wine, distilled spirits and mixed cocktails.

4. Beer and wine store licensees for beer and wine.

5. Restaurant licensees for any of the following:

(a) Mixed cocktails, with the sale of menu food items for consumption on or off the licensed premises, if the restaurant holds a permit issued pursuant to section 4-203.07 and section 4-205.02, subsection K or a lease pursuant to section 4-203.06.

(b) Beer if the restaurant holds a permit issued pursuant to section 4-205.02, subsection H.

(c) Beer, wine and distilled spirits if the restaurant holds an off-sale privileges lease with a bar or liquor store pursuant to section 4-203.07.

(d) Beer and wine if the restaurant holds an off-sale privileges lease with a beer and wine bar pursuant to section 4-203.07.

T. Notwithstanding the definition of "sell" prescribed in section 4-101, placing an order and paying for that order pursuant to subsection S of this section is not a sale until delivery has been made.  At the time that the order is placed, the licensee shall inform the purchaser that state law requires a purchaser of spirituous liquor to be at least twenty-one years of age and that the person accepting delivery of the spirituous liquor is required to comply with this state's age identification requirements as prescribed in section 4-241, subsections A and K.  The licensee may maintain a delivery service and may contract with one or more alcohol delivery contractors registered pursuant to section 4-205.13 for delivery of spirituous liquor if the spirituous liquor is packaged and tamperproof sealed by the bar, beer and wine bar, liquor store, beer and wine store or restaurant licensee or the licensee's employee and is loaded for delivery at the premises of the restaurant, beer and wine bar, liquor store, beer and wine store or bar licensee in this state and delivered in this state on the same business day. A liquor store or beer and wine store licensee may contract with one or more independent contractors as provided in subsection J of this section for delivery of spirituous liquor if the spirituous liquor is loaded for delivery at the premises of the liquor store or beer and wine store licensee in this state and delivered in this state on the same business day.  All containers of spirituous liquor delivered pursuant to subsection S of this section shall be tamperproof sealed and conspicuously labeled with the words "contains alcohol, signature of person who is twenty-one years of age or older is required for delivery". The licensee is responsible for any violation of this title or any rule adopted pursuant to this title that is committed in connection with any sale or delivery of spirituous liquor.  Delivery must be made by an employee of the licensee or an employee or authorized independent contractor of a registered alcohol delivery contractor as provided by this section who is at least twenty-one years of age and delivery must be made to a customer who is at least twenty-one years of age and who displays an identification at the time of delivery that complies with section 4-241, subsection K.  The restaurant, beer and wine bar, liquor store, beer and wine store or bar licensee shall collect payment for the full price of the spirituous liquor from the purchaser before the product leaves the licensed premises.  The director shall adopt rules that set operational limits for the delivery of spirituous liquor pursuant to this subsection and subsection S of this section with respect to the delivery of spirituous liquor. For any violation of this title or any rule adopted pursuant to this title that is based on the act or omission of a licensee's employee or a registered alcohol delivery contractor, the mitigation provision of section 4-210, subsection G applies, with the exception of the training requirement. For the purposes of this subsection and notwithstanding the definition of "sell" prescribed in section 4-101, section 4-241, subsections A and K apply only at the time of delivery. An alcohol delivery contractor, a subcontractor of an alcohol delivery contractor, an employee of an alcohol delivery contractor or an employee of a subcontractor is deemed to be acting on behalf of the licensee when making a delivery of spirituous liquor for the licensee. For the purposes of this subsection, "business day" means between the hours of 6:00 a.m. of one day and 2:00 a.m. of the next day.

 

#### Section 4-203.01. Interim permit; fee; rules

A. The director may issue an interim permit to the applicant for a license of the same series, or for the replacement of a hotel-motel license with a restaurant license, at the same premises whether that license is transferrable or nontransferable and any of the following conditions exists:

1. The director has good cause to believe the licensee is no longer in possession of the licensed premises.

2. The license for such premises was surrendered pursuant to rules of the department.

3. The applicant for the interim permit filed with the department an application for the issuance of a license of the same series of nontransferable license or the transfer or replacement of a transferable license of the same series, or for the replacement of a hotel-motel license with a restaurant license, at the same premises.

B. The application for the interim permit shall be accompanied by an interim permit fee of one hundred dollars.

C. An interim permit issued by the director pursuant to this section shall be for a period of not more than one hundred five days and shall not be extended except as provided in subsection D of this section. An interim permit is a conditional permit and authorizes the holder to sell such alcoholic beverages as would be permitted to be sold under the privileges of the license for which application has been filed with the department.

D. Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, if the director extends the time limit for action by the department in connection with a license issuance or transfer pursuant to section 4-201.01, subsection B, the director shall issue an additional interim permit for a period equal to such extension unless either:

1. No interim permit has previously been issued.

2. For good cause shown the director denies the additional interim permit.

E. Notwithstanding any other law, an interim permit may be canceled or suspended summarily at any time, if the director determines that good cause for such cancellation or suspension exists. There shall be no appeal from such cancellation or suspension of an interim permit to the board. The board may cancel an interim permit on applications that have been disapproved by the board. The cancellation or suspension of an interim permit may be appealed directly to the superior court.

F. Application for an interim permit shall be on such form as the director shall prescribe. If an application for an interim permit is withdrawn before issuance or is refused by the director, the fee that accompanies such application shall be refunded.

G. If an application for transfer of a license, person to person, or nontransferable spirituous liquor license is denied or an interim permit is revoked, suspended or expires, the licensee may request the return of the surrendered license that has been issued for such premises.

H. The director may prescribe rules governing the issuance of interim permits under this section.

I. The director may deny an interim permit in situations in which a current licensee holds a license described in section 4-209, subsection B, paragraph 12 and the current license is not in compliance with section 4-205.02.

 

#### Section 4-203.02. Special event license; rules

A. The director may issue on a temporary basis:

1. A daily on-sale special event license authorizing the sale of spirituous liquor for consumption on the premises where sold.  The fee for the license is $25 per day. The director shall transfer the monies collected to the department of health services for the purposes prescribed in title 36, chapter 18, article 2.

2. A daily off-sale special event license authorizing a charitable auction for the sale of spirituous liquor for consumption off premises.

B. Before the director may issue a temporary special event license, a special event that is to occur at an otherwise unlicensed location or by a licensee at a location that is not fully within the licensee's existing licensed premises must be approved by the board of supervisors of a county, or the board's designee, if the event is to be held in an unincorporated area or by the governing body of the city or town, or the governing body's designee, if the event is to be held in a city or town.  A denial by the county, city or town must be forwarded to the director within sixty days after the submission of an application to the county, city or town, unless the applicant has requested more time for consideration of the application.

C. The approval process prescribed in this section does not apply to physical locations that are fully within premises that are licensed pursuant to this title.

D. A physical location, other than a physical location that is owned, operated, leased, managed or controlled by the United States, this state or a city, town or county of this state, that is not licensed pursuant to this title may not be issued more than a total of thirty days of special event licenses during the same calendar year.  All applications for a special event license issued pursuant to this section must be submitted to the department at least ten days before the scheduled event. The director may waive the ten-day requirement for good cause shown.

E. The director may issue the special event license only to a government entity or a political party or campaign committee supporting a candidate for public office or a ballot measure, or a nonprofit entity that is organized as a nonprofit entity in this state or pursuant to the laws of another state and that is a nonprofit entity under section 501(c) of the internal revenue code of the United States. The nonprofit entity shall demonstrate that it is in good standing in this state. An applicant for a special event license may contract with a special event contractor for assistance in selling and serving spirituous liquor at the special event.  The special event contractor shall be listed on the application form.  The director shall require a special event contractor to provide the controlling persons' identification and background information deemed necessary to identify the special event contractor and to demonstrate proof of the contractor's authority to conduct business in this state, including providing copies of any required state or local business licenses or permits. The department shall maintain a list of special event contractors that have been employed by special event licensees during the past year and that are not otherwise in penalty status pursuant to subsection I of this section. A licensee holding a currently active series 6, 7, 11 or 12 license may serve as the special event contractor for a special event license without any additional requirements.  A new applicant for an initial special event license may be required by the department to demonstrate it is qualified, capable and reliable to conduct a special event. The department may require new special event contractors and new special event licensees to require persons who serve or sell spirituous liquor to patrons at the special event to complete an approved training course in accordance with section 4-112, subsection G, paragraph 2. A special event contractor is subject to examinations conducted pursuant to section 4-112, subsection G, paragraph 1.

F. The director may issue a temporary special event license under subsection E of this section to an affiliate of a national, statewide or international parent nonprofit organization for a special event if all of the following requirements are met:

A. The director shall determine the total number of spirituous liquor licenses by type and in each county. The director shall publish a listing of that information as determined by the director.

B. In each county, the director, each year, shall issue additional bar or liquor store licenses at the rate of one of each type for each additional ten thousand person increase over the population in that county as of July 1, 2010. For every license that has been revoked or reverted in any county, the director may issue a new license of the same series in the same county, except that if there are more than five licenses of a particular class, the director may issue five new licenses plus an additional number of new licenses equivalent to twenty percent of the difference between the number of revoked or reverted licenses per year and five. The director may waive the issuance of licenses in a county for one year where there has been no request made to the department for the issuance of a new license of that series. For the purposes of this subsection, the population of a county is deemed to be the population estimated by the office of economic opportunity as of July 1 of each year.

C. In each county, the director, each year, shall issue additional beer and wine bar licenses at the rate of one for each additional five thousand person increase over the population in that county as of July 1, 2010.  Beginning January 1, 2022, in each county, the director, each year, shall issue additional beer and wine bar licenses at the rate of one for each additional ten thousand person increase over the population in that county as of July 1, 2010.

A person issued a license authorized by subsection B or C of this section shall pay an additional issuance fee equal to the license's fair market value that shall be paid to the state general fund. An appraisal shall be conducted to determine the fair market value of that license type in a specific county.  The fair market value is defined to mean the price arrived at in good faith that a knowledgeable and willing buyer will pay and is computed by determining the average value, or weighted average value if there are trends in license pricing in that county, of licenses of the same type, free of any encumbrances, sold on the open market in the same county during the prior twelve months, but if there are not three or more sales then the fair market value is determined by two appraisals furnished to the department by independent professional appraisers employed by the director. The valuation method under both approaches shall take into account trends in the value of licenses of the specific type during the previous twelve months. A new license authorized pursuant to subsection B or C of this section may not be issued to a person or entity that has had a similar license revoked or reverted unless the person or entity provides the director with satisfactory proof that all previous liens on the revoked or reverted license have been satisfied in full.

E. The director shall employ professional appraisal services to determine the fair market value of bar, beer and wine bar or liquor store licenses.

F. If more than one person applies for an available license, a priority of applicants shall be determined by a random selection method prescribed by the director, except that the number of times that a person may enter the random selection process shall not exceed the number of licenses of that series that are available for issuance.  For the purposes of this subsection, a partnership, limited liability company, association, company or corporation is considered the same person if it is owned, managed, operated or controlled by the same controlling person.

A bar license or a beer and wine bar license shall not be issued or used if the associated off-sale use, by total retail spirituous liquor sales, exceeds thirty percent of the sales price of on-sale spirituous liquors by the licensee at that location. For dual licenses issued pursuant to a single site or where a second license is issued to a site that already has a spirituous liquor license, other than settlement licenses issued as provided by law, the applicant has the burden of establishing that public convenience and the best interest of the community will be served by the issuance of the license.

For the purposes of compliance with section 4-205.02, subsection M, paragraph 2, it shall be conclusively presumed that all on-premises sales of spirituous liquors are made under the authority of the restaurant license.

K. An applicant for a liquor store license or a beer and wine store license and the licensee of a liquor store license or a beer and wine store license may apply for sampling privileges associated with the license.  Beer and wine store premises containing less than five thousand square feet must dedicate at least seventy-five percent of retail shelf space to the sale of spirituous liquor in order to be eligible for sampling privileges. A person desiring a sampling privilege associated with a liquor store license shall apply to the director on a form prescribed and furnished by the director. The application for sampling privileges may be filed for an existing license or may be submitted with an initial license application.

#### Section 4-210. Grounds for revocation, suspension and refusal to renew; notice; complaints; hearings; defense

A. After notice and hearing, the director may suspend, revoke or refuse to renew any license, registration, lease or permit issued pursuant to this chapter for any of the following reasons:

1. There occurs on the licensed premises repeated acts of violence.

2. The licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee fails to satisfactorily maintain the capability, qualifications and reliability requirements of an applicant for a license, registration, lease or permit prescribed in section 4-202, 4-203, 4-203.06, 4-203.07 or 4-205.13.

3. The licensee, registrant, lessee, permittee or controlling person knowingly files with the department an application or other document that contains material information that is false or misleading or while under oath knowingly gives testimony in an investigation or other proceeding under this title that is false or misleading.

4. The licensee, registrant, lessee, permittee or controlling person is on the premises habitually intoxicated.

5. The licensed, registered, leased or permitted business is delinquent for more than one hundred twenty days in paying taxes, penalties or interest in an amount that exceeds $250 to this state or to any political subdivision of this state.

6. The licensee or controlling person obtains, assigns, transfers or sells a spirituous liquor license without complying with this title or leases or subleases a license.

7. The licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee fails to keep for two years and make available to the department on reasonable request all invoices, records, bills or other papers and documents relating to the purchase, sale and delivery of spirituous liquors and, in the case of a restaurant or hotel-motel licensee, all invoices, records, bills or other papers and documents relating to the purchase, sale and delivery of food.

8. The licensee, registrant, lessee, permittee or controlling person is convicted of a felony, provided that for a conviction of a corporation to serve as a reason for any action by the director, conduct that constitutes the corporate offense and was the basis for the felony conviction must have been engaged in, authorized, solicited, commanded or recklessly tolerated by the directors of the corporation or by a high managerial agent acting within the scope of employment.

9. The licensee, registrant, lessee, permittee or controlling person violates or fails to comply with this title, any rule adopted pursuant to this title or any liquor law of this state or any other state.

10. The licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee fails to take reasonable steps to protect the safety of a customer of the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee or any other person entering, leaving or remaining on the licensed premises when the licensee knew or reasonably should have known of the danger to the person, or the licensee fails to take reasonable steps to intervene by notifying law enforcement officials or otherwise to prevent or break up an act of violence occurring on the licensed premises or immediately adjacent to the premises when the licensee knew or reasonably should have known of the acts of violence.  The duty to protect a customer or other person on the licensed premises does not limit the licensee from using, as necessary, reasonable intervention, reasonable restraint or reasonable removal of a person from the premises to prevent that person from injuring other persons on the premises or damaging or disrupting the premises.

11. The licensee, registrant, lessee, permittee or controlling person knowingly associates with a person who has engaged in racketeering, as defined in section 13-2301, or who has been convicted of a felony, and the association is of a nature as to create a reasonable risk that the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee will fail to conform to the requirements of this title or of any criminal statute of this state.

12. A licensee that is a liquor store as defined in section 46-297 violates the restrictions on use of automatic teller machines or point-of-sale terminals regarding electronic benefit transfer cards prescribed in section 4-242.01.

13. There occurs on the licensed premises a serious act of violence.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "serious act of violence" means an act of violence in which a serious injury causes the death or critical injury of a person and the injuries would be obvious to a reasonable person.

14. The licensee fails to report a serious act of violence that occurs on the licensed premises.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "serious act of violence" means an act of violence in which a serious injury causes the death or critical injury of a person and the injuries would be obvious to a reasonable person.

15. The licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee violates an order of the board.

B. For the purposes of:

1. Subsection A, paragraph 8 of this section, "high managerial agent" means an officer of a corporation or any other agent of the corporation in a position of comparable authority with respect to the formulation of corporate policy.

2. Subsection A, paragraphs 9 and 10 of this section, acts or omissions of an employee of a licensee that violate this title or rules adopted pursuant to this title are deemed to be acts or omissions of the licensee.  Acts or omissions by an employee or licensee committed during the time the licensed premises were operated pursuant to an interim permit or without a license may be charged as if they had been committed during the period the premises were duly licensed.

C. The director may suspend, revoke or refuse to issue, transfer or renew a license, registration, lease or permit under this section based solely on the unrelated conduct or fitness of any officer, director, managing agent or other controlling person if the controlling person retains any interest in or control of the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee after sixty days following written notice to the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee. If the controlling person holds stock in a corporate licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee or is a partner in a partnership licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee, the controlling person may only divest himself of the controlling person's interest by transferring the interest to the existing stockholders or partners who must demonstrate to the department that they meet all the requirements for licensure, registration, leasing or permitting.  For the purposes of this subsection, the conduct or fitness of a controlling person is unrelated if it would not be attributable to the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee.

D. If the director finds, based on clear and convincing evidence in the record, that a violation involves the use by the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee of a drive-through or walk-up service window or other physical feature of the licensed premises that allows a customer to purchase spirituous liquor without leaving the customer's vehicle or, with respect to a walk-up service window that prevents the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee from fully observing the customer, and that the use of that drive-through or walk-up service window or other physical feature caused the violation, the director may suspend or terminate the licensee's, registrant's, lessee's or permittee's use of the drive-through or walk-up service window or other physical feature for the sale of spirituous liquor, in addition to any other sanction.

E. The director may refuse to transfer any license, registration, lease or permit or issue a new license, registration, lease or permit at the same location if the director has filed a complaint against the license, registration, lease, permit or location that has not been resolved alleging a violation of any of the grounds stated in subsection A of this section until the time the complaint has been finally adjudicated.

F. The director shall receive all complaints of alleged violations of this chapter and is responsible for investigating all allegations of a violation of, or noncompliance with, this title, any rule adopted pursuant to this title or any condition imposed on the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee by the license, registration, lease or permit. When the director receives three complaints from any law enforcement agency resulting from three separate incidents at a licensed, leased or permitted establishment or by a registrant within a twelve-month period, the director shall transmit a written report to the board setting forth the complaints, the results of any investigation conducted by the law enforcement agency or the department relating to the complaints and a history of all prior complaints against the license, registration, lease or permit and their disposition. The board shall review the report and may direct the director to conduct further investigation of a complaint or to serve a licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee with a complaint and notice of a hearing pursuant to subsection G of this section.

G. On the director's initiation of an investigation or on the receipt of a complaint and an investigation of the complaint as deemed necessary, the director may cause a complaint and notice of a hearing to be directed to the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee that states the violations alleged against the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee and directing the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee, within fifteen days after service of the complaint and notice of a hearing, to appear by filing with the director an answer to the complaint.  Failure of the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee to answer may be deemed an admission by the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee of commission of the act charged in the complaint. The director may then vacate the hearing and impose any sanction provided by this article.  The director may waive any sanction for good cause shown, including excusable neglect. With respect to any violation of this title or any rule adopted pursuant to this title that is based on the act or omission of a licensee's, registrant's, lessee's or permittee's employee, the director shall consider evidence of mitigation presented by the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee and established by a preponderance of the evidence that the employee acted intentionally and in violation of the express direction or policy adopted by the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee and communicated to the employee and that the employee successfully completed training in a course approved by the director pursuant to section 4-112, subsection G, paragraph 2. The director may set the hearing before the director or an administrative law judge on any of the grounds stated in subsection A of this section. Instead of issuing a complaint, the director may provide for informal disposition of the matter by consent agreement or may issue a written warning to the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee.  If a warning is issued, the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee may reply in writing and the director shall keep a record of the warning and the reply.

H. A hearing shall conform to the requirements of title 41, chapter 6, article 10. At the hearing an attorney or corporate officer or employee of a corporation may represent the corporation. The revoking, suspending or refusing to renew a license, registration, lease or permit for unpaid taxes, penalties or interest pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 5 of this section is a contested case with the department of revenue pursuant to section 42-1251.01.

I. The expiration, cancellation, revocation, reversion, surrender, acceptance of surrender or termination in any other manner of a license, registration, lease or permit does not prevent the initiation or completion of a disciplinary proceeding pursuant to this section against the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee or license, registration, lease or permit.  An order issued pursuant to a disciplinary proceeding against a license, registration, lease or permit is enforceable against other licenses, registrations, leases or permits or subsequent licenses, registrations, leases or permits in which the licensee, registrant, lessee, permittee or controlling person of the license, registration, lease or permit has a controlling interest.

J. The department shall provide the same notice as is provided to the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee to a lienholder, which has provided a document under section 4-112, subsection B, paragraph 3, of all disciplinary or compliance action with respect to a license, registration, lease or permit issued pursuant to this title. The state is not liable for damages for any failure to provide any notice pursuant to this subsection.

K. In any disciplinary action pursuant to this title, a lienholder may participate in the determination of the action.  The director shall consider mitigation on behalf of the lienholder if the lienholder proves all of the following by a preponderance of the evidence:

1. That the lienholder's interest is a bona fide security interest.  For the purposes of this paragraph, "bona fide security interest" means the lienholder provides actual consideration to the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee or the licensee's, registrant's, lessee's or permittee's predecessor in interest in exchange for the lienholder's interest.  Bona fide security interest includes a lien taken by the seller of a license, registration, lease or permit as security for the seller's receipt of all or part of the purchase price of the license, registration, lease or permit.

2. That a statement of legal or equitable interest was filed with the department before the alleged conduct occurred that is the basis for the action against the license, registration, lease or permit.

3. That the lienholder took reasonable steps to correct the licensee's, registrant's, lessee's or permittee's prior actions, if any, or initiated an action pursuant to available contract rights against the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee for the forfeiture of the license, registration, lease or permit after being provided with notice by the department of disciplinary action as provided in subsection J of this section.

4. That the lienholder was free of responsibility for the conduct that is the basis for the proposed revocation.

5. That the lienholder reasonably attempted to remain informed by the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee about the business's conduct.

L. If the director decides not to revoke the license, registration, lease or permit based on the circumstances provided in subsection K of this section, the director may issue an order requiring either, or both, of the following:

1. The forfeiture of all interest of the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee in the license, registration, lease or permit.

2. The lienholder to pay any civil monetary penalty imposed on the licensee, registrant, lessee or permittee.

M. If any on-sale licensee proposes to provide large capacity entertainment events or sporting events with an attendance capacity exceeding a limit established by the director, the director may request a security plan from the licensee that may include trained security officers, lighting and other requirements. This subsection exclusively prescribes the security requirements for a licensee and does not create any civil liability for this state, its agencies, agents or employees or a person licensed under this title or agents or employees of a licensee.

N. The director may consider as a mitigating factor or defense to a complaint against a licensee for a violation of subsection A, paragraph 10 or 13 of this section that the licensee acted reasonably, responsibly and as expeditiously as possible by asking for intervention by a peace officer to prevent or to break up a riot, a fight, an altercation or tumultuous conduct.

#### Section 4-210.01. Authority to impose civil penalty; training

A. In lieu of or in addition to the suspension or revocation of or refusal to renew a registration pursuant to section 4-205.13, subsection G and a license authorized by section 4-210, subsection A, the director may impose a civil penalty of at least $200 and not more than $3,000 for each violation. The licensee or registrant is entitled to appeal the decision of the director to the board. The board may affirm, modify or reverse the finding and decision of the director and may decrease the civil penalty imposed by the director.

B. The director may require a licensee or registrant to pay a civil penalty assessed pursuant to subsection A of this section in a single payment or in installment payments.

C. In addition to the imposition of any other penalty authorized by this title, the director may impose a requirement that the licensee or registrant or other person attend a training program approved by the department.

#### Section 4-210.02. Appeals from director

A. Except as provided in section 4-203.01, subsection E, a decision issued by the director is not final for purposes of appeal to superior court until it has first been appealed to and ruled on by the board.  Any aggrieved party may appeal any final decision of the director regarding applicants or licensees to the board based on a contention that the decision was any of the following:

1. Founded on or contained errors of law which shall specifically include errors of construction or application of any relevant rules.

2. Unsupported by any competent evidence as disclosed by the entire record.

D. The board may affirm, reverse or modify any decision issued by the director.

#### Section 4-211. Judicial review; bond

A. Except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, final decisions of the board are subject to judicial review pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

B. In the case of any judicial review of a decision of the department, the director may require the posting of a bond with the court to reimburse the department for reasonable costs in transcribing and preparing the record of the department.  The bond is payable to the department if the court awards costs to the department pursuant to section 12-912.

#### Section 4-212. Injunctions

If the board or the director has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is violating section 4-244.05 or 4-250.01 or is manufacturing, selling or dealing in spirituous liquor without a valid license, permit or registration in violation of this title, the board or the director may apply to the superior court for a temporary restraining order and other injunctive relief prohibiting the specific acts complained of by the board or the director.

 

#### Section 4-213. Restaurant audit

A. The director may require a restaurant to submit an audit of its records to demonstrate compliance with section 4-205.02. The director shall not require an establishment to submit to such an audit more than once a year after the initial twelve months of operation and shall not audit the first three months of operation even if the establishment is allowed to continue operating as a restaurant pursuant to subsection E of this section.

B. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, the department shall audit accounts, records and operations of a licensee that cover a twelve month period.  When conducting an audit, the department shall use generally accepted auditing standards.  An establishment that averages at least forty percent of its gross revenue from the sale of food during the twelve month audit period shall be deemed to comply with the gross revenue requirements of section 4-205.02. The twelve month audit period shall fall within the sixteen months immediately preceding the beginning of the audit.

C. If the audit or a consent agreement that may be offered at the discretion of the director and that is signed by the licensee and the director reveals that the licensee did not meet the definition of a restaurant as prescribed in section 4-205.02 and the percentage of food sales determined by the audit or consent agreement was:
