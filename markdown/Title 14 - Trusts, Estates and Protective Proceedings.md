3. If there is no surviving descendant or parent, to the descendants of the decedent's parents or either of them by representation.

4. If there is no surviving descendant, parent or descendant of a parent, but the decedent is survived by one or more grandparents or descendants of grandparents, half of the estate passes to the decedent's paternal grandparents equally if both survive or to the surviving paternal grandparent or the descendants of the decedent's paternal grandparents or either of them if both are deceased with the descendants taking by representation. The other half passes to the decedent's maternal relatives in the same manner. If there is no surviving grandparent or descendant of a grandparent on either the paternal or the maternal side, the entire estate passes to the decedent's relatives on the other side in the same manner as the half.

#### Section 14-2104. Heirs; surviving of decedent; time requirement; presumption; exception

A. A person who does not survive the decedent by at least one hundred twenty hours is deemed to have predeceased the decedent for purposes of homestead allowance, exempt property and intestate succession, and the decedent's heirs are determined accordingly.

B. If it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that a person who would otherwise be an heir survived the decedent by at least one hundred twenty hours, it is deemed that the individual failed to survive for the required period.

C. This section does not apply if its application would result in a taking of intestate estate by the state under section 14-2105.

#### Section 14-2105. Unclaimed estate; passage to state

If no one is qualified to claim the estate under this article, the intestate estate passes to the state.

#### Section 14-2106. Passing of estate by representation; assigning of shares; definitions

A. If under section 14-2103, paragraph 1 all or part of a decedent's intestate estate passes by representation to the decedent's descendants, that estate is divided into as many equal shares as there are surviving descendants in the generation nearest to the decedent that contains one or more surviving descendants and to deceased descendants in the same generation who left any surviving descendants. Each surviving descendant in the nearest generation is allocated one share. Any remaining shares are combined and then divided in the same manner among the surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the decedent.

B. If under section 14-2103, paragraph 3 or 4 all or part of a decedent's intestate estate passes by representation to the descendants of either of the decedent's deceased parents or to the descendants of either of the decedent's deceased paternal or maternal grandparents, all or part of the estate is divided into as many equal shares as there are surviving descendants in the generation nearest the deceased parents or either of them, or the deceased grandparents or either of them, that contains one or more surviving descendants and to deceased descendants in the same generation who left any surviving descendants. Each surviving descendant in the nearest generation is allocated one share. Any remaining shares are combined and then divided in the same manner among the surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the decedent.

C. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Deceased descendant", "deceased parent" or "deceased grandparent" means a descendant, parent or grandparent who either predeceased the decedent or is deemed to have predeceased the decedent under section 14-2104.

2. "Surviving descendant" means a descendant who neither predeceased the decedent nor is deemed to have predeceased the decedent under section 14-2104.

#### Section 14-2107. Kindred by half blood; right of inheritance

Relatives of the half blood inherit the same share they would inherit if they were of the whole blood.

#### Section 14-2108. After-born heirs; requirements

A child in gestation at a particular time is treated as living at that time if the child lives at least one hundred twenty hours after its birth.

#### Section 14-2109. Advancements of property during lifetime; effect on distribution of estate

A. If a person dies intestate as to all or a portion of that person's estate, property the decedent gave during the decedent's lifetime to a person who, at the decedent's death, is an heir is treated as an advancement against the heir's intestate share only if the decedent declared in a contemporaneous writing or the heir acknowledged in writing that the gift is an advancement or if the decedent's contemporaneous writing or the heir's written acknowledgment otherwise indicates that the gift is to be taken into account in computing the division and distribution of the decedent's intestate estate.

B. For the purposes of this section, property advanced during the decedent's lifetime is valued as of the time the heir came into possession or enjoyment of the property or as of the time of the decedent's death, whichever first occurs.

C. If the recipient of the property fails to survive the decedent the property is not taken into account in computing the division and distribution of the decedent's intestate estate unless the decedent's contemporaneous writing provides otherwise.

#### Section 14-2110. Debts owed to a decedent; effect on distribution of estate

A debt owed to a decedent is not charged against the intestate share of any person except the debtor. If the debtor fails to survive the decedent, the debt is not taken into account in computing the intestate share of the debtor's descendants.

#### Section 14-2111. Effect of alienage on distribution of estate

No person is disqualified to take as an heir because that person or a person through whom that person claims is or has been an alien.

#### Section 14-2113. Heirs related to decedent through two lines; single share

A person who is related to the decedent through two lines of relationship is entitled to only a single share based on the relationship that would entitle the person to the larger share.

#### Section 14-2114. Parent and child relationship; intestate succession; adopted children

A. Except as provided in subsections B and C of this section, for the purposes of intestate succession, a person is the child of that person's natural parents, regardless of their marital status. If this issue is in dispute the court shall establish that relationship under title 25, chapter 6, article 1.

B. An adopted person is the child of that person's adopting parent or parents and not of the natural parents. Adoption of a child by the spouse of either natural parent has no effect on the relationship between the child and that natural parent or on the right of the child or a descendant of the child to inherit from or through the other natural parent.

C. Inheritance from or through a child by either natural parent or the natural parent's kindred is precluded unless that natural parent has openly treated the child as a natural child and has not refused to support the child.

### Article 2 - Waiver of Rights of Spouse

#### Section 14-2207. Rights of surviving spouse; waiver; requirements; effect

A. A surviving spouse may waive the person's homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance rights in whole or in part either before or after marriage by a written contract, agreement or waiver that is signed by the surviving spouse.

B. A surviving spouse's waiver is not enforceable if the surviving spouse provides that either of the following is true:

1. That person did not execute the waiver voluntarily.

2. The waiver was unconscionable when it was executed and before its execution that person:

(a) Was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the decedent.

(b) Did not voluntarily and expressly waive, in writing, any right to disclosure of the property or financial obligations of the decedent beyond the disclosure provided.

(c) Did not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge of the property or financial obligations of the decedent.

C. The issue of a waiver's unconscionability may only be decided by the court as a matter of law.

D. Unless it provides to the contrary, a waiver that contains the words "all rights" or equivalent language, in relation to the property or estate of a present or prospective spouse or a complete property settlement entered into after or in anticipation of separation or divorce, is a waiver of all rights of homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance by each spouse in the property of the other and a renunciation by each of all benefits that would otherwise pass to each person from the other by intestate succession or by virtue of any will executed before the waiver or property settlement.

### Article 3 - Spouse and Children Unprovided for in Will

#### Section 14-2301. Entitlement of spouse; premarital will

A. If a testator's surviving spouse married the testator after the testator executed a will, the surviving spouse is entitled to receive as an intestate share that is not less than the value of the share of the estate the spouse would have received if the testator had died intestate as to any portion of the testator's estate that neither is devised to a child of the testator who was born before the testator married the surviving spouse and who is not a child of the surviving spouse nor is devised to a descendant of that child or that passes under section 14-2603 or 14-2604 to that child or to a descendant of that child, unless:

1. It appears from the will or other evidence that the will was made in contemplation of the testator's marriage to the surviving spouse.

2. The will expresses the intention that it is to be effective notwithstanding any subsequent marriage.

3. The testator provided for the spouse by transfer outside the will and the intent that the transfer is in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown by the testator's statements or can be reasonably inferred from the amount of the transfer or other evidence.

B. In satisfying the share provided by subsection A of this section, any devises made by the will to the testator's surviving spouse are applied first. Other devises abate pursuant to section 14-3902 unless the devise is to a child of the testator who was born before the testator married the surviving spouse and who is not a child of the surviving spouse or is a devise or substitute gift under section 14-2603 or 14-2604 to a descendant of that child.

#### Section 14-2302. Omitted children; shares; definition

A. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, if a testator fails to provide by will for a child who is born or adopted after the testator executes the will, the omitted child receives a share in the estate as follows:

1. If the testator had no child living when the testator executed the will, an omitted child receives a share in the estate equal in value to what the child would have received if the testator had died intestate, unless the will devised all or substantially all of the estate to the other parent of the omitted child and that other parent survives the testator and is entitled to take under the will.

2. If the testator had one or more children living when the testator executed the will and the will devised property or an interest in property to one or more of the then-living children, an omitted child is entitled to share in the testator's estate as follows:

(a) The portion of the testator's estate in which the omitted child is entitled to share is limited to devises made to the testator's then-living children under the will.

(b) As limited under subdivision (a) of this paragraph, the omitted child is entitled to receive the share of the testator's estate that the child would have received if the testator had included all omitted children with the children to whom devises were made under the will and had given an equal share of the estate to each child.

B. To the extent feasible, the interest granted an omitted child under subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section shall be of the same character, whether equitable or legal, present or future, as that devised to the testator's then-living children under the will.

C. In satisfying a share prescribed by subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section, devises to the testator's children who were living when the will was executed abate ratably. In abating the devises of the then-living children, the court shall preserve to the maximum extent possible the character of the testamentary plan adopted by the testator.

D. Subsection A of this section does not apply if either of the following is true:

1. It appears from the will that the omission was intentional.

2. The testator provided for the omitted child by transfer outside the will and the intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown by the testator's statements or can be reasonably inferred from the amount of the transfer or other evidence.

E. If at the time the testator executed the will the testator fails to provide by will for a living child solely because the testator believes the child to be dead, the child is entitled to share in the estate as if the child were an omitted after-born or after-adopted child.

F. In satisfying a share provided by subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, devises made by the will abate under section 14-3902.

G. For the purposes of this section, "omitted child" means a child who was born or adopted after the testator executed a will.

### Article 4 - Exempt Property and Allowances

#### Section 14-2401. Applicable law

This article applies to the estate of a decedent who dies domiciled in this state. Rights to homestead allowance, exempt property and family allowance for a decedent who is not domiciled in this state at the time of death are governed by the law of the decedent's domicile at death.

#### Section 14-2402. Homestead allowance

A. A decedent's surviving spouse is entitled to a homestead allowance of eighteen thousand dollars. If there is no surviving spouse each minor child and each dependent child of the decedent are entitled to a homestead allowance of eighteen thousand dollars divided by the number of minor and dependent children of the decedent.

B. The homestead allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims against the estate, except expenses of administration.

C. The homestead allowance is chargeable against any benefit or share that passes to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent child by the decedent's will, by nonprobate transfer pursuant to section 14-6102 or by intestate succession, unless it is otherwise provided by the decedent's will or by the governing instrument for a nonprobate transfer.  To determine the homestead allowance under this section, a survivorship interest in a joint tenancy of real estate is considered a nonprobate transfer pursuant to section 14-6102.

#### Section 14-2403. Exempt property; value; priority

A. In addition to the homestead allowance, the decedent's surviving spouse is entitled from the estate to a value that is not more than seven thousand dollars in excess of any security interests in that estate in the following:

1. Household furniture.

2. Automobiles.

3. Furnishings.

4. Appliances.

5. Personal effects.

B. If there is no surviving spouse the decedent's minor and dependent children are entitled jointly to the same value as prescribed in subsection A of this section.

C. If encumbered chattels are selected and the value in excess of security interests and that of other exempt property is less than seven thousand dollars or if there is not seven thousand dollars worth of exempt property in the estate, the spouse or minor or dependent children are entitled to any other assets of the estate to the extent necessary to make up the seven thousand dollar value.

D. Rights to exempt property and assets needed to make up a deficiency of exempt property have priority over all claims against the estate except expenses of administration. The right to any assets to make up a deficiency of exempt property abates as necessary to permit earlier payment of the homestead allowance and family allowance. These rights are chargeable against any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or minor or dependent children by the decedent's will by a nonprobate transfer pursuant to section 14-6102 or by intestate succession, unless otherwise provided by the decedent's will or by the governing instrument for a nonprobate transfer.

#### Section 14-2404. Family allowance; use; length; priority; termination by death

A. The decedent's surviving spouse and minor children whom the decedent was obligated to support and children who were in fact being supported by the decedent are entitled to a reasonable allowance in money out of the estate for their maintenance during the period of administration. This allowance shall not continue for longer than one year if the estate is inadequate to discharge allowed claims. The allowance may be paid as a lump sum or in periodic installments. It is payable to the surviving spouse, if living, for the use of the surviving spouse and minor and dependent children. Otherwise this allowance is payable to the children or to persons who have the care and custody of these children. If a minor child or a dependent child is not living with the surviving spouse, the allowance may be made partially to the child or the child's guardian or other person who has the care and custody of the child and partially to the spouse, as their needs may appear.

B. The family allowance is exempt from and has priority over all claims except expenses of administration and except the homestead allowance.

C. The family allowance is chargeable against any benefit or share passing to the surviving spouse or children by the decedent's will, by a nonprobate transfer pursuant to section 14-6102 or by intestate succession unless otherwise provided by the decedent's will or by the governing instrument for a nonprobate transfer.

D. The death of a person entitled to the family allowance terminates the right to allowances not yet paid.

 

 

 

#### Section 14-2405. Homestead; exempt property and allowances; restriction; source; determination; documentation

A. If the estate is otherwise sufficient, property specifically devised may not be used to satisfy rights to homestead allowance or exempt property. Subject to this restriction, the surviving spouse, guardians of minor children or children who are adults may select property of the estate as homestead allowance and exempt property. The personal representative may make those selections if the surviving spouse, the children or the guardians of the minor children are unable or fail to do so within a reasonable time or if there is no guardian of a minor child.

B. The personal representative may execute an instrument or deed of distribution to establish the ownership of property taken as homestead allowance or exempt property.

C. The personal representative may determine the family allowance in a lump sum that does not exceed twelve thousand dollars or in periodic installments that do not exceed one thousand dollars per month for one year, and may disburse monies of the estate in payment of the family allowance and any part of the homestead allowance payable in cash.

D. The personal representative or an interested person aggrieved by any selection, determination, payment, proposed payment or failure to act under this section may petition the court for appropriate relief including a family allowance other than one that the personal representative determined or could have determined.

#### Section 14-2503. Holographic will

A will that does not comply with section 14-2502 is valid as a holographic will, whether or not witnessed, if the signature and the material provisions are in the handwriting of the testator.

#### Section 14-2504. Self-proved wills; sample form; signature requirements

A. A will may be simultaneously executed, attested and made self-proved by its acknowledgment by the testator and by affidavits of the witnesses if the acknowledgment and affidavits are made before an officer authorized to administer oaths under the laws of the state in which execution occurs and are evidenced by the officer's certificate, under official seal, in substantially the following form:

C. A signature affixed to a self-proving affidavit attached to a will is considered a signature affixed to the will, if necessary to prove the will's due execution.

#### Section 14-2505. Witnesses; requirements; definition

A. A person who is generally competent to be a witness may act as a witness to a will.

B. For any will executed on or after October 1, 2019, unless the will is made self-proved as prescribed in section 14-2504 or 14-2519, a person may not act as a witness to a will if that person is a devisee under that will or is related by blood, marriage or adoption to a devisee under that will.

C. For the purposes of this section, "devisee" means a person who is designated in the will to receive a devise or who is a beneficiary of a trust that is designated in the will to receive a devise.

#### Section 14-2506. Execution; choice of law

A. A paper will is valid if it is executed in compliance with section 14-2502.  An electronic will is valid if it is executed in compliance with section 14-2518.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a paper will or an electronic will is valid if its execution complies with the law at the time of execution of the place where the testator is physically present when the testator executes the will, or of the law of the place where at the time of execution or at the time of death the testator is domiciled, has a place of abode or is a national.

#### Section 14-2507. Revocation of will; requirements

A. A testator may revoke a will in whole or in part:

1. By executing a subsequent will that revokes the previous will or part expressly or by inconsistency.

2. By performing a revocatory act on the will if the testator performs the act with this intent or if another person performs the act in the testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction. For the purposes of this paragraph, "revocatory act on the will" includes burning, tearing, canceling, obliterating, rendering unreadable or destroying the will or any part of it. A burning, tearing or canceling is a revocatory act on the will whether or not the burn, tear or cancellation touched any of the words on the will.

B. If a subsequent will does not expressly revoke a previous will, the execution of the subsequent will wholly revokes the previous will by inconsistency if the testator intended the subsequent will to replace rather than supplement the previous will.

C. The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will to replace rather than supplement a previous will if the subsequent will makes a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the previous will is revoked and only the subsequent will is operative on the testator's death.

D. The testator is presumed to have intended a subsequent will to supplement rather than replace a previous will if the subsequent will does not make a complete disposition of the testator's estate. If this presumption arises and is not rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, the subsequent will revokes the previous will only to the extent the subsequent will is inconsistent with the previous will and each will is fully operative on the testator's death to the extent the wills are not inconsistent.

#### Section 14-2508. Change of circumstances; effect on will

Except as provided in sections 14-2803 and 14-2804, a change of circumstances does not revoke a will or any part of it.

#### Section 14-2509. Revoking a subsequent will; effect; reviving a revoked will; requirements

A. If a testator revokes a subsequent will that wholly revoked a previous will under section 14-2507, subsection A, paragraph 2, the previous will remains revoked unless it is revived. The previous will is revived if it is evident from the circumstances of the revocation of the subsequent will or from the testator's contemporary or subsequent declarations that the testator intended the previous will to take effect as executed.

B. If a testator revokes a subsequent will that partly revoked a previous will under section 14-2507, subsection A, paragraph 2, the revoked part of the previous will is revived unless it is evident from the circumstances of the revocation of the subsequent will or from the testator's contemporary or subsequent declarations that the testator did not intend the revoked part to take effect as executed.

C. If a testator revokes a subsequent will that revoked a previous will in whole or in part by another later will, the previous will remains revoked in whole or in part, unless the testator revives it or its revoked part. The previous will or its revoked part is revived to the extent it appears from the terms of the later will that the testator intended the previous will to take effect.

#### Section 14-2510. Incorporating outside document into a will; requirements

A testator may incorporate a written document into the testator's will by reference if the following requirements are met:

1. The document exists at the time the testator executes the will.

2. The will's language manifests the testator's intent to incorporate this document.

3. The will's language describes the document with enough specificity to allow its identification.

#### Section 14-2511. Testamentary additions to trusts; requirements; effect of revocation

A. A will may validly devise property to the trustee of a trust established or to be established:

1. During the testator's lifetime by the testator alone, by the testator and some other person or by some other person, including a funded or unfunded life insurance trust, even if the settlor has reserved any or all rights of ownership of the insurance contracts.

2. At the testator's death by the testator's devise to the trustee if the trust is identified in the testator's will and its terms are set forth in a written instrument other than a will executed before, concurrently with or after the execution of the testator's will or in another individual's will if that other individual has predeceased the testator, regardless of the existence, size or character of the corpus of the trust. The devise is not invalid because the trust is amendable or revocable or because the trust was amended after the execution of the will or after the testator's death.

B. Unless the testator's will provides otherwise, property devised to a trust described in subsection A is not held under a testamentary trust of the testator but becomes a part of the trust to which it is devised and must be administered and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the governing instrument that states the terms of the trust, including any amendments made before or after the testator's death.

C. Unless the testator's will provides otherwise, a revocation or termination of the trust before the testator's death causes the devise to lapse.

#### Section 14-2512. Disposition of property by reference to acts of independent significance

A will may dispose of property by reference to acts, such as the execution or revocation of another person's will, that have significance apart from their effect on the dispositions made by the will whether they occur before or after the execution of the will or before or after the testator's death.

#### Section 14-2513. References to separate lists; requirements

A. Notwithstanding section 14-2503 relating to holographic wills, a will may refer to a written statement or list to dispose of items of tangible personal property other than money and not otherwise specifically disposed of by the will.

B. To be admissible under this section as evidence of the intended disposition, the writing shall either be in the testator's handwriting or be signed by the testator and shall describe the items and the devisees with reasonable certainty.

C. The writing may be:

1. Referred to as one to be in existence at the time of the testator's death.

2. Prepared before or after the execution of the will.

3. Altered by the testator after its preparation.

4. A writing that has no significance apart from its effect on the dispositions made by the will.

#### Section 14-2514. Contracts regarding wills; requirements; effect

A. After December 31, 1994, a person may enter into a contract to make a will or devise or not to revoke a will or devise or to die intestate only by:

1. Provisions of a will that state the material provisions of the contract.

2. An express reference in a will to a contract and extrinsic evidence proving the terms of the contract.

3. A writing signed by the decedent evidencing the contract.

B. The execution of a joint will or mutual wills does not create a presumption of a contract not to revoke the will or wills.

#### Section 14-2516. Custodian of will; duties; liability

A. After the death of a testator and on request of an interested person, a person having custody of a will of the testator shall deliver it with reasonable promptness to a person able to secure its probate or, if none is known, to an appropriate court.

B. A person who wilfully fails to deliver a will as required by this section is liable to any person aggrieved for any damages caused by this failure.

C. A person who wilfully refuses or fails to deliver a will after being ordered by the court in a proceeding brought for the purpose of compelling delivery is subject to penalty for contempt of court.

#### Section 14-2517. Penalty clause for contest; restriction

A provision in a will purporting to penalize an interested person for contesting the will or instituting other proceedings or actions relating to the estate is unenforceable if probable cause exists for the contest, proceedings or actions.

#### Section 14-2518. Electronic will; requirements; interpretation

A. An electronic will must meet all of the following requirements:

1. Be created and maintained in an electronic record.

2. Contain the electronic signature of the testator or the testator's electronic signature made by some other individual in the testator's conscious presence and by the testator's direction.

3. Contain the electronic signatures of at least two persons, each of whom met both of the following requirements:

(a) Was physically present with the testator when the testator electronically signed the will, acknowledged the testator's signature or acknowledged the will.

(b) Electronically signed the will within a reasonable time after the person witnessed the testator signing the will, acknowledging the testator's signature or acknowledging the will as described in subdivision (a) of this paragraph.

4. State the date that the testator and each of the witnesses electronically signed the will.

5. Contain a copy of a government-issued identification card of the testator that was current at the time of execution of the will.

B. Except as provided in this section and sections 14-2519, 14-2520, 14-2521, 14-2522 and 14-2523, any question raised about the force, effect, validity and interpretation of an electronic will shall be determined in the same manner as a question regarding a paper will executed pursuant to section 14-2502.

C. This section does not apply to a trust except a testamentary trust created in an electronic will.

#### Section 14-2519. Self-proved electronic will

In addition to the requirements of section 14-2504, to be self-proved, an electronic will must meet all of the following requirements:

1. Contain the electronic signature and electronic seal of a notary public placed on the will in accordance with applicable law.

2. Designate a qualified custodian to maintain custody of the electronic will.

3. Before being offered for probate or being reduced to a certified paper original, be under the exclusive control of a qualified custodian at all times.

#### Section 14-2520. Qualified custodian

### Article 6 - Rules of Construction

#### Section 14-2601. Scope of article

In the absence of a finding of a contrary intention, the rules of construction in this article control the construction of a will.

 

 

#### Section 14-2602. Passage of existing and after-acquired property by will

A will may provide for the passage of all property the testator owns at death and all property acquired by the estate after the testator's death.

 

 

#### Section 14-2603. Substitute gifts; class gifts; definitions

A. If a devisee fails to survive the testator and is a grandparent, a descendant of a grandparent or a stepchild of either the testator or the donor of a power of appointment exercised by the testator's will, the following apply:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 3 of this subsection, if the devise is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased devisee leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the devisee's surviving descendants and they take, by representation, the property to which the devisee would have been entitled if the devisee had survived the testator.

2. Except as provided in paragraph 3 of this subsection, if the devise is in the form of a class gift, other than a devise to issue, descendants, heirs of the body, heirs, next of kin, relatives or family or a class described by similar language, a substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of the deceased devisee. The property to which the devisees would have been entitled if all of them had survived the testator passes to the surviving devisees and the surviving descendants of the deceased devisees. Each surviving devisee takes the share to which that person would have been entitled if the deceased devisees had survived the testator. Each deceased devisee's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased devisee take by representation the share to which the deceased devisee would have been entitled if the deceased devisee had survived the testator. For the purposes of this paragraph, "deceased devisee" means a class member who failed to survive the testator and left one or more surviving descendants.

3. If the will creates an alternative devise with respect to a devise for which a substitute gift is created by paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection, the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative devise, whether or not an expressly designated devisee of the alternative devise is entitled to take under the will.

B. Unless the language that creates a power of appointment expressly prohibits the substitution of the appointee's descendants for the appointee, a surviving descendant of a deceased appointee can be substituted for the appointee, whether or not the descendant is an object of the power of appointment.

C. For the purposes of section 14-2601, words of survivorship, such as in a devise to an individual "if he survives me", or in a devise to "my surviving children", are, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section.

D. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Alternative devise" means a devise that is expressly created by the will and under the terms of the will can take effect instead of another devise on the happening of one or more events, including the survival of the testator or the failure to survive the testator, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent or any other form. A residuary clause may constitute an alternative devise with respect to a nonresiduary devise, whether or not the will specifically provides that, on lapse or failure, the nonresiduary devise or nonresiduary devises in general pass under the residuary clause.

2. "Class member" includes a person who fails to survive the testator but who would have taken under a devise in the form of a class gift if that person had survived the testator.

3. "Devise" includes an alternative devise, a devise in the form of a class gift and an exercise of a power of appointment.

4. "Devisee" includes:

(a) A class member if the devise is in the form of a class gift.

(b) A person or class member who was deceased at the time the testator executed the will as well as a person or class member who was then living but who failed to survive the testator.

(c) An appointee under a power of appointment exercised by the testator's will.

5. "Stepchild" means a child of the surviving, deceased or former spouse of the testator or of the donor of a power of appointment and not of the testator or donor.

6. "Surviving devisee" or "surviving descendant" means a devisee or a descendant who neither predeceased the testator nor is deemed to have predeceased the testator under section 14-2702.

7. "Testator" includes the donee of a power of appointment if the power is exercised in the testator's will.

#### Section 14-2604. Failure of testamentary provision; effect

A. Except as provided in section 14-2603, a devise, other than a residuary devise, that fails for any reason becomes a part of the residue.

B. Except as provided in section 14-2603, if the residue is devised to two or more persons, the share of a residuary devisee that fails for any reason passes to the other residuary devisee or to other residuary devisees in proportion to the interest of each in the remaining part of the residue.

 

 

#### Section 14-2605. Securities increase in value after death; effect; exception

A. If a testator executes a will that devises securities and the testator then owned securities that meet the description in the will, the devise includes additional securities owned by the testator at death to the extent the additional securities were acquired by the testator after the will was executed as a result of the testator's ownership of the described securities and are securities of any of the following types:

1. Securities of the same organization acquired by reason of action initiated by the organization or any successor, related or acquiring organization, excluding any acquired by exercise of purchase options.

2. Securities of another organization acquired as a result of any merger, consolidation, reorganization or other distribution by the organization or any successor, related or acquiring organization.

3. Securities of the same organization acquired as a result of a plan of reinvestment.

B. Distributions in cash before death with respect to a described security are not part of the devise.

 

 

#### Section 14-2606. Right to specific devises; unpaid proceeds of sale, condemnation or insurance; sale by conservator or agent

A. A specific devisee has a right to the specifically devised property in the testator's estate at death and to the following:

1. Any balance of the purchase price, together with any security agreement, owing from a purchaser to the testator at death by reason of sale of the property.

2. Any amount of a condemnation award for the taking of the property unpaid at death.

3. Any proceeds unpaid at death on fire or casualty insurance on or other recovery for injury to the property.

4. Property owned by the testator at death and acquired as a result of foreclosure or obtained in lieu of foreclosure of the security interest for a specifically devised obligation.

B. If specifically devised property is sold or mortgaged by a conservator or by an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated principal or if a condemnation award, insurance proceeds or recovery for injury to the property are paid to a conservator or to an agent acting within the authority of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated principal, the specific devisee has the right to a general pecuniary devise equal to the net sale price, the amount of the unpaid loan, the condemnation award, the insurance proceeds or the recovery. It is not necessary to adjudicate the issue of incapacity for an agent to act under this subsection. An agent's actions that are within the authority of a durable power of attorney are presumed to be on behalf of the incapacitated principal. For the purposes of this subsection, "incapacitated principal" means a principal who is an incapacitated person.

C. The right of a specific devisee under subsection B is reduced by any right the devisee has under subsection A.

D. The provisions in subsection B that relate to the actions of a conservator do not apply if, after the sale, mortgage, condemnation, casualty or recovery, it was adjudicated that the testator's incapacity ceased and the testator survived the adjudication by one year.

 

 

#### Section 14-2607. Specific devise; nonexoneration

Subject to any mortgage interest existing at the date of death, a specific devise passes without right of exoneration, regardless of a general directive in the will to pay debts.

 

 

#### Section 14-2608. Exercise of power of appointment

In the absence of a requirement that a power of appointment be exercised by a reference or by an express or specific reference to that power, a general residuary clause in a will or a will making general disposition of all of the testator's property expresses an intention to exercise a power of appointment held by the testator only if the power is a general power and the creating instrument does not contain a gift if the power is not exercised or the testator's will manifests an intention to include the property subject to the power.

 

 

#### Section 14-2609. Satisfaction of a devise during the testator's life; requirements; valuation

A. Property a testator gave to a person while the testator was alive is treated as a satisfaction of a devise in whole or in part if any of the following requirements are met:

1. The will provides for deduction of the gift.

2. The testator declared in a contemporaneous writing that the gift is in satisfaction of the devise or that its value is to be deducted from the value of the devise.

3. The devisee acknowledged in writing that the gift is in satisfaction of the devise or that its value is to be deducted from the value of the devise.

B. For purposes of partial satisfaction, property given while the testator was alive is valued as of the time the devisee came into possession or enjoyment of the property or at the testator's death, whichever occurs first.

C. To satisfy the requirements of sections 14-2603 and 14-2604 if the devisee fails to survive the testator, the gift is treated as a full or partial satisfaction of the devise, as appropriate, unless the testator's contemporaneous writing provides otherwise.

 

 

### Article 7 - Governing Instruments

#### Section 14-2701. Scope of article

In the absence of a finding of a contrary intention, the rules of construction in this article control the construction of a governing instrument. The rules of construction in this article apply to a governing instrument of any type, except as the application of a particular section is limited by its terms to a specific type or types of provision or governing instrument.

#### Section 14-2702. Devisees; surviving of testator; requirement; exception

A. For the purposes of this article, except as provided in subsection D of this section, a person who is not established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived an event, including the death of another person, by one hundred twenty hours is deemed to have predeceased the event.

B. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, for purposes of a provision of a governing instrument that relates to a person surviving an event, including the death of another person, a person who is not established by clear and convincing evidence to have survived the event by one hundred twenty hours is deemed to have predeceased the event.

C. Except as provided in subsection D of this section, if it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that one of two co-owners with right of survivorship survived the other co-owner by one hundred twenty hours, one-half of the property passes as if one had survived by one hundred twenty hours and one-half as if the other had survived by one hundred twenty hours, and if there are more than two co-owners and it is not established by clear and convincing evidence that at least one of them survived the others by one hundred twenty hours, the property passes in the proportion that one bears to the whole number of co-owners. For the purposes of this subsection, "co-owners with right of survivorship" includes joint tenants, tenants by the entireties and other co-owners of property or accounts held under circumstances that entitle one or more to the whole of the property or account on the death of the other or others.

D. The survival requirements of this section do not apply if:

1. The governing instrument contains language that deals explicitly with simultaneous deaths or deaths in a common disaster and that language is operable under the facts of the case.

2. The governing instrument expressly indicates that a person is not required to survive an event, including the death of another person, by any specified period or expressly requires the person to survive the event by a specified period. However, survival of the event or the specified period must be established by clear and convincing evidence.

3. The imposition of a one hundred twenty hour requirement of survival would cause a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment to fail to qualify for validity, or to become invalid under section 14-2901, subsection A, B or C. However, survival must be established by clear and convincing evidence.

4. The application of a one hundred twenty hour requirement of survival to multiple governing instruments would result in an unintended failure or duplication of a disposition. However, survival must be established by clear and convincing evidence.

E. A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument who is not entitled to the payment or item of property or for having taken any other action in good faith reliance on the beneficiary's apparent entitlement under the terms of the governing instrument, before the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this section. A payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or any other action taken after the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this section.

F. Written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under subsection E of this section must be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by certified mail, return receipt requested, or served on the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. On receipt of written notice of a claimed lack of entitlement under this section, a payor or other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents' estates located in the county of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the monies or item of property and, on making its determination under this section, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. Payments, transfers or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.

G. A person who purchases property for value and without notice or who receives any payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation is neither obligated to return the payment, item of property or benefit nor is liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit. However, a person who, not for value, receives a payment, an item of property or any other benefit to which the person is not entitled is obligated to return the payment, item of property or benefit or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit to the person who is entitled to it.

 

 

#### Section 14-2703. Choice of law; effect on governing instrument

The meaning and legal effect of a governing instrument is determined by the local law of the state selected in the governing instrument unless the application of that law is contrary to the requirements of article 4 of this chapter relating to exempt property and allowances or is contrary to any other public policy of this state otherwise applicable to the disposition.

 

 

#### Section 14-2704. Power of appointment; exercise by reference; presumption

If a governing instrument that creates a power of appointment expressly requires that the power be exercised by a reference, an express reference or a specific reference to the power or its source, it is presumed that the donor's intention was to prevent an inadvertent exercise of the power.

 

 

#### Section 14-2705. Adopted children; children born out of wedlock; class gifts

A. A person who is adopted or born out of wedlock and that person's descendants, if appropriate to the class, are included in class gifts and other terms of relationship in accordance with the intestate succession under article 1 of this chapter. Terms of relationship that do not differentiate relationships by blood from those by affinity, such as "uncles", "aunts", "nieces" or "nephews", are construed to exclude relatives by affinity. Terms of relationship that do not differentiate relationships by the half blood from those by the whole blood, such as "brothers", "sisters", "nieces" or "nephews", are construed to include both types of relationships.

B. In addition to the requirements of subsection A, in construing a dispositive provision of a transferor who is not the adopting parent, an adopted person is not considered the child of the adopting parent unless the adopted person lived while a minor, either before or after the adoption, as a regular member of the household of the adopting parent at any time.

 

 

#### Section 14-2706. Failure of beneficiary to survive decedent; effect; protection from liability; third parties; definitions

A. If a beneficiary fails to survive the decedent and is a grandparent, a descendant of a grandparent or a stepchild of the decedent, the following apply:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 4 of this subsection, if the beneficiary designation is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased beneficiary leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the beneficiary's surviving descendants. They take by representation the property to which the beneficiary would have been entitled if the beneficiary had survived the decedent.

2. Except as provided in paragraph 4 of this subsection, if the beneficiary designation is in the form of a class gift, other than a beneficiary designation to issue, descendants, heirs of the body, heirs, next of kin, relatives, or family, or a class described by similar language, a substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of any deceased beneficiary. The property to which the beneficiaries would have been entitled if all of them had survived the decedent passes to the surviving beneficiaries and the surviving descendants of the deceased beneficiaries. Each surviving beneficiary takes the share to which that beneficiary would have been entitled if the deceased beneficiaries had survived the decedent. Each deceased beneficiary's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased beneficiary take by representation the share to which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled if the deceased beneficiary had survived the decedent. For the purposes of this paragraph, "deceased beneficiary" means a class member who failed to survive the decedent and who left one or more surviving descendants.

3. Words of survivorship, such as in a beneficiary designation to an individual "if he survives me" or in a beneficiary designation to "my surviving children" are, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section.

4. If a governing instrument creates an alternative beneficiary designation with respect to a beneficiary designation for which a substitute gift is created by paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection, the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative beneficiary designation, whether or not an expressly designated beneficiary of the alternative beneficiary designation is entitled to take.

B. A payor is protected from liability in making payments under the terms of the beneficiary designation until the payor has received written notice of a claim to a substitute gift under this section. Payment made before the receipt of written notice of a claim to a substitute gift under this section discharges the payor, but not the recipient, from all claims for the amounts paid. A payor is liable for a payment made after the payor has received written notice of the claim. A recipient is liable for a payment received, whether or not written notice of the claim is given.

C. The written notice of the claim must be mailed to the payor's main office or home by certified mail, return receipt requested, or served on the payor in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. On receipt of written notice of the claim, a payor may pay any amount owed by it to the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents' estates located in the county of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the monies and, on its determination under this section, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. Payment made to the court discharges the payor from all claims for the amounts paid.

D. A person who purchases property for value and without notice or who receives a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation is neither obligated under this section to return the payment, item of property or benefit nor is liable under this section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit. However, a person who, not for value, receives a payment, an item of property or any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property or benefit or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit to the person who is entitled to it under this section.

E. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Alternative beneficiary designation" means a beneficiary designation that is expressly created by the governing instrument and, under the terms of the governing instrument, can take effect instead of another beneficiary designation on the happening of one or more events, including survival of the decedent or failure to survive the decedent, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent or any other form.

2. "Beneficiary" means the beneficiary of a beneficiary designation and includes a class member if the beneficiary designation is in the form of a class gift and also includes a person or class member who was deceased at the time the beneficiary designation was executed as well as a person or class member who was then living but who failed to survive the decedent.

3. "Beneficiary designation" includes an alternative beneficiary designation and a beneficiary designation in the form of a class gift.

4. "Class member" includes a person who fails to survive the decedent but who would have taken under a beneficiary designation in the form of a class gift if that person had survived the decedent.

5. "Stepchild" means a child of the decedent's surviving, deceased or former spouse and not of the decedent.

6. "Surviving beneficiary" or "surviving descendant" means a beneficiary or a descendant who neither predeceased the decedent nor is deemed to have predeceased the decedent under section 14-2702.

#### Section 14-2707. Future interests; trusts; distribution date; passage of property; alternative future interest; definitions

A. A future interest under the terms of a trust is contingent on the beneficiary surviving the distribution date. If a beneficiary of a future interest under the terms of a trust fails to survive the distribution date, the following apply:

1. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, if the future interest is not in the form of a class gift and the deceased beneficiary leaves surviving descendants, a substitute gift is created in the beneficiary's surviving descendants. Surviving descendants take by representation the property to which the beneficiary would have been entitled if the beneficiary had survived the distribution date.

2. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, if the future interest is in the form of a class gift, other than a future interest to issue, descendants, heirs of the body, heirs, next of kin, relatives, or family or a class described by similar language, a substitute gift is created in the surviving descendants of any deceased beneficiary. The property to which the beneficiaries would have been entitled if all of them had survived the distribution date passes to the surviving beneficiaries and the surviving descendants of the deceased beneficiaries. Each surviving beneficiary takes the share to which that person would have been entitled if the deceased beneficiaries had survived the distribution date. Each deceased beneficiary's surviving descendants who are substituted for the deceased beneficiary take by representation the share to which the deceased beneficiary would have been entitled if the deceased beneficiary had survived the distribution date.

B. Words of survivorship attached to a future interest are, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, a sufficient indication of an intent contrary to the application of this section. Words of survivorship include words of survivorship that relate to the distribution date or to an earlier or an unspecified time, whether those words of survivorship are expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent or any other form.

C. If a governing instrument creates an alternative future interest with respect to a future interest for which a substitute gift is created by subsection A of this section, the substitute gift is superseded by the alternative future interest, whether or not an expressly designated beneficiary of the alternative future interest is entitled to take in possession or enjoyment.

D. If after the application of this section there is no surviving taker, the property passes in the following order:

1. If the trust was created in a nonresiduary devise in the transferor's will or in a codicil to the transferor's will, the property passes under the residuary clause in the transferor's will. For purposes of this paragraph, the residuary clause is treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust.

2. If no taker is produced by the application of paragraph 1 of this subsection, the property passes to the transferor's heirs under section 14-2711.

E. A residuary clause in a will does not create an alternative future interest with respect to a future interest created in a nonresiduary devise in the will, whether or not the will specifically provides that lapsed or failed devises are to pass under the residuary clause.

F. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Alternative future interest" means an expressly created future interest that can take effect in possession or enjoyment instead of another future interest on the happening of one or more events, including survival of an event or failure to survive an event, whether an event is expressed in condition-precedent, condition-subsequent or any other form.

2. "Beneficiary" means the beneficiary of a future interest and includes a class member if the future interest is in the form of a class gift.

3. "Class member" includes a person who does not survive the distribution date but who would have taken under a future interest in the form of a class gift if that person had survived the distribution date.

4. "Deceased beneficiary" means a class member who failed to survive the distribution date and left one or more surviving descendants.

5. "Distribution date", with respect to a future interest, means the time when the future interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment. Distribution date does not mean a date that necessarily occurs at the beginning or end of a calendar day but that may occur at a time during the course of a day.

6. "Future interest" includes an alternative future interest and a future interest in the form of a class gift.

7. "Future interest under the terms of a trust" means a future interest that was created by a transfer creating a trust or to an existing trust or by an exercise of a power of appointment to an existing trust, directing the continuance of an existing trust, designating a beneficiary of an existing trust or creating a trust.

8. "Surviving beneficiary" or "surviving descendant" means a beneficiary or a descendant who neither predeceased the distribution date nor is deemed to have predeceased the distribution date under section 14-2702.

#### Section 14-2708. Class gifts to descendants, issue or heirs of the body; form of distribution if none specified

If a class gift in favor of descendants, issue or heirs of the body does not specify the manner in which the property is to be distributed among the family members who comprise that class, the property that comprises the class gift is distributed among the class members who are living when the interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment. These class members receive shares they would receive under the applicable law of intestate succession if the designated ancestor had died intestate owning the subject matter of the class gift.

#### Section 14-2709. Property distribution by representation or per capita at each generation; distribution per stirpes; application of section; definitions

A. If an applicable statute or a governing instrument calls for property to be distributed by representation or per capita at each generation, the property is divided into as many equal shares as there are surviving descendants in the generation nearest to the designated ancestor that contains one or more surviving descendants and deceased descendants in the same generation who left any surviving descendants. Each surviving descendant in the nearest generation is allocated one share. Any remaining shares are combined and then divided in the same manner among the surviving descendants of the deceased descendants as if the surviving descendants who were allocated a share and their surviving descendants had predeceased the distribution date.

B. If a governing instrument calls for property to be distributed per stirpes, the property is divided into as many equal shares as there are surviving children of the designated ancestor and deceased children who left surviving descendants. Each surviving child is allocated one share. The share of each deceased child with surviving descendants is divided in the same manner, with subdivision repeating at each succeeding generation until the property is fully allocated among surviving descendants.

C. For the purposes of subsections A and B of this section, a person who is deceased and who left no surviving descendant is disregarded. A person who leaves a surviving ancestor who is a descendant of the designated ancestor is not entitled to a share.

D. This section applies to governing instruments executed after December 31, 1994. In the case of a codicil to a will, an amendment to a trust or another document amending a governing instrument, the date of execution is the date of the codicil, amendment or amending document only if the codicil, amendment or amending document materially affects the dispositive provision being construed under this section.

E. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Deceased child" or "deceased descendant" means a child or a descendant who either predeceased the distribution date or is deemed to have predeceased the distribution date under section 14-2702.

2. "Distribution date" with respect to an interest means the time when the interest is to take effect in possession or enjoyment. Distribution date does not mean a date that necessarily occurs at the beginning or end of a calendar day but that may occur at a time during the course of a day.

3. "Surviving ancestor", "surviving child" or "surviving descendant" means an ancestor, a child or a descendant who neither predeceased the distribution date nor is deemed to have predeceased the distribution date under section 14-2702.

#### Section 14-2710. Worthier title doctrine; nonrecognition

The common law doctrine of worthier title is not recognized in this state. Therefore, language in a governing instrument that describes the beneficiaries of a disposition as the transferor's heirs, heirs at law, next of kin, distributees, relatives, or family, or by similar language, does not create or presumptively create a reversionary interest in the transferor.

#### Section 14-2711. Distribution to heirs; effect

A. If an applicable statute or a governing instrument calls for a present or future distribution to or creates a present or future interest in a designated individual's heirs, heirs at law, next of kin, relatives, or family, or by similar language, the property passes to those persons, including the state, who would inherit the designated individual's intestate estate under the intestate succession law of the designated individual's domicile if the designated individual died when the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment.  The property passes to those persons in the proportion described by the laws of intestate succession.

B. If the designated individual's surviving spouse is living but is remarried at the time the disposition is to take effect in possession or enjoyment, the surviving spouse is not an heir of the designated individual.

#### Section 14-2712. Burdens relating to validity of governing instruments

A. A proponent of a governing instrument has the burden of establishing prima facie proof of due execution in all cases.

B. It is a rebuttable presumption that a person who executes a governing instrument is presumed to have capacity to execute the governing instrument and to have done so free from undue influence and duress.

C. If the validity of a governing instrument is challenged on the grounds of revocation by a later governing instrument, the validity of the later governing instrument must be determined first.

D. Except as prescribed pursuant to subsections E and F of this section, a party that challenges the validity of a governing instrument has the burden of establishing the invalidity of that governing instrument by a preponderance of the evidence.

E. A governing instrument is presumed to be the product of undue influence if either:

1. A person who had a confidential relationship to the creator of the governing instrument was active in procuring its creation and execution and is a principal beneficiary of the governing instrument.

2. The preparer of the governing instrument or the preparer's spouse or parents or the issue of the preparer's spouse or parents is a principal beneficiary of the governing instrument.  This paragraph does not apply if the governing instrument was prepared for a person who is a grandparent of the preparer, the issue of a grandparent of the preparer or the respective spouses or former spouses of persons related to the preparer.

F. The beneficiary of the governing instrument may overcome a presumption of undue influence by a preponderance of the evidence.

G. For the purposes of this section, determining if a person is a principal beneficiary of a governing instrument or the preparer of a governing instrument is a question of fact to be determined by the totality of the circumstances.

H. This section does not apply to the following:

1. Proceedings to determine the validity of a durable power of attorney pursuant to section 14-5506, subsection B.

2. Proceedings to determine ownership of multiple party accounts pursuant to section 14-6211.

 

### Article 8 - Disqualification

#### Section 14-2802. Effect of divorce, annulment and decree of separation

A. A person who is divorced from the decedent or whose marriage to the decedent has been annulled is not a surviving spouse unless, by virtue of a subsequent marriage, that person is married to the decedent at the time of death. A decree of separation that does not terminate the status of husband and wife is not a divorce for purposes of this section.

B. For the purposes of this section, "surviving spouse" does not include:

1. A person who obtains or consents to a final decree or judgment of divorce from the decedent or an annulment of the marriage if that decree or judgment is not recognized as valid in this state, unless they subsequently participate in a marriage ceremony purporting to marry each to the other or live together as husband and wife.

2. A person who, after an invalid decree or judgment of divorce or annulment obtained by the decedent, participates in a marriage ceremony with a third person.

3. A person who was a party to a valid proceeding concluded by an order purporting to terminate all marital property rights.

#### Section 14-2803. Murder of decedent; effect; federal law; definitions

A. A person who feloniously and intentionally kills the decedent forfeits all benefits under this chapter with respect to the decedent's estate, including an intestate share, an elective share, an omitted spouse's or child's share, a homestead allowance, exempt property and a family allowance. If the decedent died intestate, the decedent's intestate estate passes as if the killer disclaimed that person's intestate share.

B. The felonious and intentional killing of the decedent:

1. Revokes any revocable:

(a) Disposition or appointment of property made by the decedent to the killer in a governing instrument.

(b) Provision in a governing instrument conferring a general or nongeneral power of appointment on the killer.

(c) Nomination of the killer in a governing instrument, nominating or appointing the killer to serve in any fiduciary or representative capacity, including a personal representative, executor, trustee or agent.

2. Severs the interests of the decedent and killer in property held by them at the time of the killing as joint tenants with the right of survivorship or as community property with the right of survivorship, transforming the interests of the decedent and killer into tenancies in common.

C. A severance under subsection B, paragraph 2 does not affect any third party interest in property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an apparent title by survivorship in the killer unless a writing declaring the severance has been noted, registered, filed or recorded in records appropriate to the kind and location of the property that is relied on as evidence of ownership in the ordinary course of transactions involving that property.

D. Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the killer disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section or, in the case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, as if the killer predeceased the decedent.

E. A wrongful acquisition of property or interest by a killer not covered by this section shall be treated in accordance with the principle that a killer cannot profit from that person's wrong.

F. After all right to appeal has been exhausted, a judgment of conviction establishing criminal accountability for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent conclusively establishes the convicted person as the decedent's killer for purposes of this section. In the absence of a conviction, the court, on the petition of an interested person, shall determine whether, under the preponderance of evidence standard, the person would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent. If the court determines under that standard that the person would be found criminally accountable for the felonious and intentional killing of the decedent, the determination conclusively establishes that person as the decedent's killer for purposes of this section.

G. A payor or other third party is not liable for having made a payment or transferred an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument affected by an intentional and felonious killing or for having taken any other action in good faith reliance on the validity of the governing instrument on request and satisfactory proof of the decedent's death and before the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section. Any payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or any other action taken after the payor or other third party received written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.

H. Written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under subsection G of this section must be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by certified mail, return receipt requested, or served on the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. On receipt of written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section, a payor or any other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate, or if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents' estates located in the county of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the monies or item of property and, on its determination under this section, shall order disbursement in accordance with the determination. Payments, transfers or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.

I. A person who purchases property for value and without notice or who receives a payment or any other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation is neither obligated under this section to return the payment, item of property or benefit nor is liable under this section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit. However, a person who, not for value, receives a payment, an item of property or any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property or benefit, or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit, to the person who is entitled to it under this section.

J. If this section or any part of this section is preempted by federal law with respect to a payment, an item of property or any other benefit covered by this section, a person who, not for value, receives the payment, item of property or any other benefit to which the person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return it to the person who would have been entitled to it if this section or part of this section were not preempted or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit.

K. The decedent's estate may petition the court to establish a constructive trust on the property or the estate of the killer, effective from the time of the killer's act that caused the death, in order to secure the payment of all damages and judgments from conduct that, pursuant to subsection F of this section, resulted in criminal conviction of either spouse in which the other spouse or a child was the victim.

L. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Disposition or appointment of property" includes a transfer of an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument.

2. "Felonious and intentional" means a conviction or a finding of guilty except insane for a homicide pursuant to section 13-1103, 13-1104 or 13-1105.

3. "Governing instrument" means a governing instrument executed by the decedent.

4. "Revocable", with respect to a disposition, appointment, provision or nomination, means one under which the decedent, at the time of or immediately before death, was alone empowered, by law or under the governing instrument, to cancel the designation in favor of the killer, whether or not the decedent was then empowered to designate the decedent in place of the decedent's killer or the decedent then had capacity to exercise the power.

 

#### Section 14-2804. Termination of marriage; effect; revocation of probate and nonprobate transfers; federal law; definitions

A. Except as provided by the express terms of a governing instrument, a court order or a contract relating to the division of the marital estate made between a divorced couple before or after the marriage, divorce or annulment, the divorce or annulment of a marriage:

1. Revokes any revocable:

(a) Disposition or appointment of property made by a divorced person to that person's former spouse in a governing instrument and any disposition or appointment created by law or in a governing instrument to a relative of the divorced person's former spouse.

(b) Provision in a governing instrument conferring a general or nongeneral power of appointment on the divorced person's former spouse or on a relative of the divorced person's spouse.

(c) Nomination in a governing instrument that nominates a divorced person's former spouse or a relative of the divorced person's former spouse to serve in any fiduciary or representative capacity, including a personal representative, executor, trustee, conservator, agent or guardian.

2. Severs the interests of the former spouses in property held by them at the time of the divorce or annulment as joint tenants with the right of survivorship or as community property with the right of survivorship and transforms the interests of the former spouses into tenancies in common.

B. A severance under subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section does not affect any third party interest in property acquired for value and in good faith reliance on an apparent title by survivorship in the survivor of the former spouses unless a writing declaring the severance has been noted, registered, filed or recorded in records appropriate to the kind and location of the property that a person relied on as evidence of ownership in the ordinary course of transactions involving that property.

C. Provisions of a governing instrument are given effect as if the former spouse and relatives of the former spouse disclaimed all provisions revoked by this section or, in the case of a revoked nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, as if the former spouse and relatives of the former spouse died immediately before the divorce or annulment.

D. Provisions revoked solely by this section are revived by the divorced person's remarriage to the former spouse or by a nullification of the divorce or annulment.

E. No change of circumstances other than as described in this section and in section 14-2803 effects a revocation.

F. Any payor or other third party is not liable for making a payment or transferring an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument affected by a divorce, annulment or remarriage, or for taking any other action in good faith reliance on the validity of the governing instrument, before the payor or other third party receives written notice of the divorce, annulment or remarriage. Any payor or other third party is liable for a payment made or any other action taken after the payor or other third party receives written notice of a claimed forfeiture or revocation under this section.

G. Written notice of the divorce, annulment or remarriage under subsection F of this section must be mailed to the payor's or other third party's main office or home by certified mail, return receipt requested, or served on the payor or other third party in the same manner as a summons in a civil action. On receipt of written notice of the divorce, annulment or remarriage, a payor or any other third party may pay any amount owed or transfer or deposit any item of property held by it to or with the court having jurisdiction of the probate proceedings relating to the decedent's estate or, if no proceedings have been commenced, to or with the court having jurisdiction of probate proceedings relating to decedents' estates located in the county of the decedent's residence. The court shall hold the monies or item of property and, on its determination under this section, shall order disbursement or transfer in accordance with the determination. Payments, transfers or deposits made to or with the court discharge the payor or other third party from all claims for the value of amounts paid to or items of property transferred to or deposited with the court.

H. A person who purchases property from a former spouse, a relative of a former spouse or any other person for value and without notice or who receives from a former spouse, a relative of a former spouse or any other person a payment or other item of property in partial or full satisfaction of a legally enforceable obligation is neither obligated under this section to return the payment, item of property or benefit nor is liable under this section for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit. However, a former spouse, a relative of a former spouse or any other person who, not for value, received a payment, an item of property or any other benefit to which that person is not entitled under this section is obligated to return the payment, item of property or benefit to the person who is entitled to it under this section or is personally liable for the amount of the payment or the value of the item of property or benefit.

I. For the purpose of this section:

1. "Disposition or appointment of property" includes a transfer of an item of property or any other benefit to a beneficiary designated in a governing instrument.

2. "Divorce or annulment" means any divorce or annulment or any dissolution or declaration of invalidity of a marriage that would exclude the spouse as a surviving spouse within the meaning of section 14-2802 but does not include a decree of separation that does not terminate the status of husband and wife.

3. "Divorced person" includes a person whose marriage has been annulled.

4. "Governing instrument" means an instrument executed by the divorced person before the divorce or annulment of that person's marriage to that person's former spouse.

5. "Relative of the divorced person's former spouse" means a person who is related to the divorced person's former spouse by blood, adoption or affinity and who, after the divorce or annulment, is not related to the divorced person by blood, adoption or affinity.

6. "Revocable", with respect to a disposition, appointment, provision or nomination, means one under which the divorced person, at the time of the divorce or annulment, was alone empowered by law or under the governing instrument to cancel a designation in favor of that person's former spouse or former spouse's relative, whether or not the divorced person was then empowered to designate himself or herself in place of that person's former spouse or in place of the former spouse's relative and whether or not the divorced person then had the capacity to exercise the power.

### Article 9 - Nonvested Interests

#### Section 14-2901. Nonvested property interest; general power of appointment; validity; exception

A. A nonvested property interest is invalid unless at least one of the following is true:

1. At the time the interest is created it is certain to vest or to terminate not later than twenty-one years after the death of a person who is then alive.

2. The interest either vests or terminates within five hundred years after its creation.

3. The interest is under a trust whose trustee has the expressed or implied power to sell the trust assets and at one or more times after the creation of the interest one or more persons who are living when the trust is created have an unlimited power to terminate the interest.

B. A general power of appointment that is not presently exercisable because of a condition precedent is invalid unless any of the following is true:

1. At the time the power is created the condition precedent is certain to be satisfied or becomes impossible to satisfy no later than twenty-one years after the death of a person who is then alive.

2. The condition precedent either is satisfied or becomes impossible to satisfy within five hundred years after its creation.

3. The power is with respect to an interest under a trust whose trustee has the expressed or implied power to sell the trust assets and at one or more times after the creation of the interest one or more persons who are living when the trust is created have an unlimited power to terminate the interest.

C. A nongeneral power of appointment or a general testamentary power of appointment is invalid unless at least one of the following is true:

1. At the time the power is created it is certain to be irrevocably exercised or otherwise to terminate not later than twenty-one years after the death of a person who is then alive.

2. The power is irrevocably exercised or otherwise terminates within five hundred years after its creation.

3. The power is with respect to an interest under a trust whose trustee has the expressed or implied power to sell the trust assets and at one or more times after the creation of the interest one or more persons who are living when the trust is created have an unlimited power to terminate the interest.

D. In determining whether a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment is valid under subsection A, paragraph 1, subsection B, paragraph 1 or subsection C, paragraph 1, the possibility that a child will be born to a person after that person's death is disregarded.

E. If the governing instrument seeks to do either of the following after the expiration of the latest period described by subsection A, B or C, that language is inoperative to the extent it produces a period of time that exceeds five hundred years after the creation of the trust:

1. Disallow the vesting or termination of an interest or trust beyond that time.

2. Postpone the vesting or termination of an interest or trust until that time.

#### Section 14-2902. Nonvested property interest or power of appointment; creation

B. If there is a person who alone can exercise a power created by a governing instrument to become the unqualified beneficial owner of a nonvested property interest or a property interest subject to a power of appointment described in section 14-2901, subsection B or C, the nonvested property interest or power of appointment is created when that person's power to become the unqualified beneficial owner terminates. A joint power with respect to community property or to marital property held by a married couple is a power exercisable by one person alone.

C. A nonvested property interest or a power of appointment arising from a transfer of property to a previously funded trust or any other existing property arrangement is created when the nonvested property interest or power of appointment in the original contribution was created.

 

#### Section 14-2903. Reformation of a disposition plan; conditions

On the petition of an interested person, a court shall reform a disposition in the manner that most closely approximates the transferor's manifested plan of distribution and that is within the five hundred years allowed under section 14-2901 if:

5. A nonvested property interest held by a charity, government or governmental agency or subdivision, if the nonvested property interest is preceded by an interest held by another charity, government or governmental agency or subdivision.

6. A nonvested property interest in or a power of appointment with respect to a trust or any other property arrangement forming part of any pension, profit sharing, stock bonus, health, disability, death benefit, income deferral or other current or deferred benefit plan for one or more employees, independent contractors or their beneficiaries or spouses, to which contributions are made for the purpose of distributing to or for the benefit of the participants or their beneficiaries or spouses the property, income or principal in the trust or other property arrangement, except a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment that is created by an election of a participant or a beneficiary or spouse.

7. A property interest, power of appointment or arrangement that was not subject to the common law rule against perpetuities or is excluded by the laws of this state.

B. If a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment is determined in a judicial proceeding to violate this state's rule against perpetuities as that rule existed when the nonvested property interest or power of appointment was created, a court on the petition of an interested person may reform the disposition in the manner that most closely approximates the transferor's manifested plan of distribution and that is within the limits of the requirements of section 14-2901.

C. For the purposes of this article, if the person who exercises a power of appointment so provides in the exercise, a nonvested property interest or a power of appointment created by the exercise of a power of appointment is created when the power is irrevocably exercised or when a revocable exercise becomes irrevocable.

 

#### Section 14-2906. Rule against perpetuities; supersession

This article applies notwithstanding common law rules against perpetuities or section 33-261.

#### Section 14-2907. Honorary trusts; trusts for pets; conditions

A. If a trust is for a specific lawful noncharitable purpose or for lawful noncharitable purposes to be selected by the trustee and there is no definite or definitely ascertainable beneficiary designated, the trust may be performed by the trustee for not longer than ninety years whether or not the terms of the trust contemplate a longer duration.

B. A trust for the care of a designated domestic or pet animal is valid.  The trust terminates when no living animal is covered by the trust.  A governing instrument shall be liberally construed to bring the transfer within this subsection, to presume against the merely precatory or honorary nature of the disposition and to carry out the general intent of the transferor.  Extrinsic evidence is admissible in determining the transferor's intent.

C. In addition to the provisions of subsection A or B, a trust created under this section is subject to the following:

1. Except as expressly provided otherwise in the trust instrument, no portion of the principal or income may be converted to the use of the trustee or to any use other than for the trust's purposes or for the benefit of a covered animal.

2. On termination, the trustee shall transfer the unexpended trust property in the following order:

(a) As directed in the trust instrument.

(b) If the trust was created in a nonresiduary clause in the transferor's will or in a codicil to the transferor's will, under the residuary clause in the transferor's will.

(c) If no taker is produced by the application of subdivision (a) or (b) of this paragraph, to the transferor's heirs under section 14-2711.

3. For the purposes of section 14-2707, the residuary clause is treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust.

4. The intended use of the principal or income can be enforced by a person who is designated for that purpose in the trust instrument or, if none, by a person appointed by a court on application to it by any person.

5. Except as ordered by the court or required by the trust instrument, no filing, report, registration, periodic accounting, separate maintenance of funds, appointment or fee is required by reason of the existence of the fiduciary relationship of the trustee.

6. A court may reduce the amount of the property transferred if it determines that amount substantially exceeds the amount required for the intended use. The amount of the reduction, if any, passes as unexpended trust property under paragraph 2 of this subsection.

7. If no trustee is designated or no designated trustee is willing or able to serve, a court shall name a trustee. A court may order the transfer of the property to another trustee if this is necessary to assure that the intended use is carried out and if no successor trustee is designated in the trust instrument or if no designated successor trustee agrees to serve or is able to serve. A court may also make other orders and determinations that it determines advisable to carry out the intent of the transferor and this section.

## Chapter 3 - PROBATE OF WILLS AND ADMINISTRATION

### Article 1 - General Provisions

#### Section 14-3101. Devolution of estate at death; administration on deaths of husband and wife

A. The power of a person to leave property by will, and the rights of creditors, devisees and heirs to his property are subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this title to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates. Upon the death of a person, his separate property and his share of community property devolves to the persons to whom the property is devised by his last will, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse, renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of testamentary disposition to his heirs, or to those indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving renunciation or other circumstances affecting the devolution of intestate estates. The devolution of separate property and decedent's share of community property is subject to rights to the allowance in lieu of homestead, exempt property and family allowance, to rights of creditors and to administration as provided in this title. In addition, the surviving spouse's share of the community property is subject to administration until the time for presentation of claims has expired, and thereafter only to the extent necessary to pay community claims.

B. If a husband and wife both die, and the administration of one of their estates is not completed prior to commencement of administration of the other, their estates may be combined in a single administration with the same personal representative, if feasible. A single application or petition may be made to obtain appointment of a personal representative and to determine testacy. If their estates devolve as if each spouse survived the other because of application of section 14-2702, and their estates are not combined, half of their community property is subject to administration in each estate and community claims will be charged ratably to each half of the community property.

#### Section 14-3102. Necessity of statement or order of probate for will; exception

Except as provided in section 14-3971, to be effective to prove the transfer of any property or to nominate an executor, a will must be declared to be valid by a statement of informal probate by the registrar, or an adjudication of probate by the court, except that a duly executed and unrevoked will which has not been probated may be admitted as evidence of a devise if both:

1. No court proceeding concerning the succession or administration of the estate has occurred.

2. Either the devisee or his successors and assigns possessed the property devised in accordance with the provisions of the will, or the property devised was not possessed or claimed by anyone by virtue of the decedent's title during the time period for testacy proceedings.

#### Section 14-3103. Necessity of appointment for administration

Except as otherwise provided in chapter 4 of this title, to acquire the powers and undertake the duties and liabilities of a personal representative of a decedent, a person shall be appointed by order of the court or statement of the registrar, shall qualify and shall be issued letters. Administration of an estate is commenced by the issuance of letters.

#### Section 14-3104. Claims against decedent; necessity of administration

No proceeding to enforce a claim against the estate of a decedent or his successors may be revived or commenced before the appointment of a personal representative. After the appointment and until distribution, all proceedings and actions to enforce a claim against the estate are governed by the procedure prescribed by this chapter. After distribution a creditor whose claim has not been barred may recover from the distributees as provided in section 14-3934 or from a former personal representative individually liable as provided in section 14-3935. This section has no application to a proceeding by a secured creditor of the decedent to enforce his right to his security except as to any deficiency judgment which might be sought therein.

#### Section 14-3105. Proceedings affecting devolution and administration; jurisdiction of subject matter

A. Persons interested in decedents' estates may apply to the registrar for determination in the informal proceedings provided in this chapter and may petition the court for orders in formal proceedings within the court's jurisdiction including but not limited to those described in this article.

B. The court may hear and determine any matter affecting the administration and distribution of decedents' estates after notice to interested persons in conformity with section 14-1401 and only in a formal proceeding. Persons notified are bound though less than all interested persons may have been given notice.

C. The court has general jurisdiction that it may exercise in a formal proceeding in any other action or proceeding concerning succession or to which an estate, through a personal representative, may be a party, including:

1. Actions to determine title or to quiet title to property alleged to belong to the estate.

2. Actions for personal injury and wrongful death.

3. Actions to quiet title of property that belongs to the estate.

4. Actions against third parties to recover estate assets.

5. Any action or proceeding in which property distributed by a personal representative or its value is sought to be subjected to rights of creditors or successors of the decedent.

#### Section 14-3107. Scope of proceedings; proceedings independent; exception

Unless supervised administration as described in article 5 is involved:

1. Each proceeding before the court or registrar is independent of any other proceeding involving the same estate.

2. Petitions for formal orders of the court may combine various requests for relief in a single proceeding if the orders sought may be finally granted without delay. Except as required for proceedings which are particularly described by other sections of this chapter, no petition is defective because it fails to embrace all matters which might then be the subject of a final order.

3. Proceedings for probate of wills or adjudications of no will may be combined with proceedings for appointment of personal representatives.

4. A proceeding for appointment of a personal representative is concluded by an order making or declining the appointment.

#### Section 14-3108. Probate, testacy and appointment proceedings; ultimate time limit

An informal probate or appointment proceeding or formal testacy or appointment proceeding, other than a proceeding to probate a will previously probated at the testator's domicile and appointment proceedings relating to an estate in which there has been a prior appointment, shall not be commenced more than two years after the decedent's death, except:

1. If a previous proceeding was dismissed because of doubt about the fact of the decedent's death, appropriate probate, appointment or testacy proceedings may be maintained at any time thereafter upon a finding that the decedent's death occurred prior to the initiation of the previous proceeding and the applicant or petitioner has not delayed unduly in initiating the subsequent proceeding.

2. Appropriate probate, appointment or testacy proceedings may be maintained in relation to the estate of an absent, disappeared or missing person for whose estate a conservator has been appointed, at any time within two years after the conservator becomes able to establish the death of the protected person.

3. A proceeding to contest an informally probated will and to secure appointment of the person with legal priority for appointment in the event the contest is successful may be commenced within the later of twelve months from the informal probate or two years from the decedent's death.

4. An informal probate or appointment or a formal testacy or appointment proceeding may be commenced thereafter if no court proceeding concerning the succession or administration has occurred within the two year period. If proceedings are brought under this exception, the personal representative has no right to possess estate assets as provided in section 14-3709 beyond that necessary to confirm title thereto in the rightful successors to the estate. Claims other than expenses of administration shall not be presented against the estate.

These limitations do not apply to proceedings to construe probated wills or determine heirs of an intestate. In cases under paragraph 1 or 2 of this section, the date on which a testacy or appointment proceeding is properly commenced shall be deemed to be the date of the decedent's death for purposes of other limitations provisions of this title which relate to the date of death.

#### Section 14-3109. Statutes of limitation on decedent's cause of action

Upon the death of a person in whose favor there is a cause of action which has not been barred as of the date of his death, the limitation of the action ceases to run until a personal representative is appointed or until twelve months after the death, whichever first occurs, but shall not bar such action sooner than four months after death even if a personal representative is appointed earlier.

#### Section 14-3110. Action by or against personal representative; survival of causes of action

Every cause of action, except a cause of action for damages for breach of promise to marry, seduction, libel, slander, separate maintenance, alimony, loss of consortium or invasion of the right of privacy, shall survive the death of the person entitled thereto or liable therefor, and may be asserted by or against the personal representative of such person, provided that upon the death of the person injured, damages for pain and suffering of such injured person shall not be allowed.

### Article 2 - Venue for Probate and Administration; Priority to Administer; Demand for Notice

#### Section 14-3201. Venue for first and subsequent estate proceedings; location of property

A. Venue for the first informal or formal testacy or appointment proceedings after a decedent's death is:

1. In the county where the decedent had his domicile at the time of his death.

2. If the decedent was not domiciled in this state, in any county where property of the decedent was located at the time of his death.

B. Venue for all subsequent proceedings within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court is in the place where the initial proceeding occurred, unless the initial proceeding has been transferred as provided in section 14-1303 or subsection C of this section.

C. If the first proceeding was informal, on application of an interested person and after notice to the proponent in the first proceeding, the court, upon finding that venue is elsewhere, may transfer the proceeding and the file to the other court.

D. For the purpose of aiding determinations concerning location of assets which may be relevant in cases involving non-domiciliaries, a debt, other than one evidenced by investment or commercial paper or other instrument in favor of a non-domiciliary, is located where the debtor resides, or if the debtor is a person other than an individual, at the place where it has its principal office. Commercial paper, investment paper and other instruments are located where the instrument is. An interest in property held in trust is located where the trustee may be sued.

#### Section 14-3202. Appointment or testacy proceedings; conflicting claim of domicile in another state

If conflicting claims as to the domicile of a decedent are made in a formal testacy or appointment proceeding commenced in this state, and in a testacy or appointment proceeding after notice pending at the same time in another state, the court of this state must stay, dismiss or permit suitable amendment in, the proceeding here unless it is determined that the local proceeding was commenced before the proceeding elsewhere. The determination of domicile in the proceeding first commenced must be accepted as determinative in the formal testacy or appointment proceeding in this state.

#### Section 14-3203. Priority among persons seeking appointment as personal representative

A. Whether the proceedings are formal or informal, persons who are not disqualified have priority for appointment in the following order:

1. The person with priority as determined by a probated will including a person nominated by a power conferred in a will.

2. The surviving spouse of the decedent who is a devisee of the decedent.

3. Other devisees of the decedent.

4. The surviving spouse of the decedent.

5. Other heirs of the decedent.

6. If the decedent was a veteran or the spouse or child of a veteran, the department of veterans' services.

7. Forty-five days after the death of the decedent, any creditor, except a funeral director or funeral establishment owner who has control of the decedent's remains.

8. The public fiduciary.

B. An objection to an appointment can be made only in formal proceedings. In case of objection the priorities stated in subsection A of this section apply, except that:

1. If the estate appears to be more than adequate to meet exemptions and costs of administration but inadequate to discharge anticipated unsecured claims, the court, on petition of creditors, may appoint any qualified person.

2. In case of objection to appointment of a surviving spouse, other than one whose priority is determined by will, by an heir or devisee appearing to have a substantial interest in the estate, and the surviving spouse is found by the court to be unsuitable, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to heirs and devisees, whose interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than half of the probable distributable value or, in default of this accord, any suitable person.

3. In case of objection to appointment of a person who is not a surviving spouse, other than one whose priority is determined by will, by an heir or devisee appearing to have a substantial interest in the estate, the court may appoint a person who is acceptable to heirs and devisees whose interests in the estate appear to be worth in total more than half of the probable distributable value, or, in default of this accord any suitable person.

C. A person entitled to letters under subsection A, paragraphs 2 through 5 of this section and a person who is at least fourteen years of age who would be entitled to letters but for the person's age may nominate a qualified person to act as personal representative.  Any person who is at least eighteen years of age may renounce the person's right to nominate or to an appointment by appropriate writing filed with the court. If two or more persons share a priority, those of them who do not renounce must concur in nominating another to act for them or in applying for appointment.

D. Conservators of the estates of protected persons, or if there is no conservator, any guardian except a guardian ad litem of a minor or incapacitated person, may exercise the same right to nominate, to object to another's appointment, or to participate in determining the preference of a majority in interest of the heirs and devisees that the protected person or ward would have if qualified for appointment.

E. Formal proceedings are required to appoint a personal representative in any of the following situations:

1. If there is a person with a higher order of priority who has not renounced or waived the person's right by appropriate writing filed with the court.

2. If a priority is shared by two or more persons, as devisees under subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section, or as heirs under subsection A, paragraph 5 of this section, and one or more of them has not renounced or concurred in nominating the person whose appointment is applied for.

3. If appointment is sought for a person who does not have any priority under this section, under this paragraph the court shall determine that those having priority do not object to the appointment, and that administration is necessary.

F. A person is not qualified to serve as a personal representative who is:

1. Under the age of majority as defined in section 1-215.

2. A person whom the court finds unsuitable in formal proceedings.

3. A foreign corporation.

G. A personal representative appointed by a court of the decedent's domicile has priority over all other persons except if the decedent's will nominates different persons to be personal representative in this state and in the state of domicile. The domiciliary personal representative may nominate another, who shall have the same priority as the domiciliary personal representative.

H. This section governs priority for appointment of a successor personal representative but does not apply to the selection of a special administrator.

#### Section 14-3204. Demand for notice of order or filing concerning decedent's estate

Any person desiring notice of any order or filing pertaining to a decedent's estate in which he has a financial or property interest may file a demand for notice with the court at any time after the death of the decedent stating the name of the decedent, the nature of his interest in the estate and the demandant's address or that of his attorney. The demandant shall mail a copy of the demand to the personal representative if one has been appointed. After filing of a demand, no order or filing to which the demand relates shall be made or accepted without notice as prescribed in section 14-1401 to the demandant or his attorney. The validity of an order which is issued or filing which is accepted without compliance with this requirement shall not be affected by the error, but the petitioner receiving the order or the person making the filing may be liable for any damage caused by the absence of notice. The requirement of notice arising from a demand under this provision may be waived in writing by the demandant and shall cease upon the termination of his interest in the estate.

### Article 3 - Informal Probate and Appointment Proceedings

(f) A statement that the time limit for informal probate or appointment as provided in this chapter has not expired either because two years or less have passed since the decedent's death, or, if more than two years from death have passed, that circumstances as described by section 14-3108 authorizing tardy probate or appointment have occurred.

2. An application for informal probate of a will shall state the following in addition to the statements required by paragraph 1 of this subsection:

(a) That the original of the decedent's last will is in the possession of the court, or accompanies the application, or that a certified copy of a will probated in another jurisdiction accompanies the application.

(b) That the applicant, to the best of the applicant's knowledge, believes the will to have been validly executed.

(c) That, after the exercise of reasonable diligence, the applicant is unaware of any instrument revoking the will, and that the applicant believes that the instrument that is the subject of the application is the decedent's last will.

C. By verifying an application for informal probate, or informal appointment, the applicant submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding for relief from fraud relating to the application, or for perjury, that may be instituted against the applicant.

#### Section 14-3302. Informal probate; duty of registrar; effect of informal probate

Upon receipt of an application requesting informal probate of a will, the registrar, upon making the findings required by section 14-3303 shall issue a written statement of informal probate if at least one hundred twenty hours have elapsed since the decedent's death. Informal probate is conclusive as to all persons until superseded by an order in a formal testacy proceeding. No defect in the application or procedure relating thereto which leads to informal probate of a will renders the probate void.

#### Section 14-3303. Informal probate; proof and findings required

A. In an informal proceeding for original probate of a will, the registrar shall determine whether:

1. The application is complete.

2. The applicant has made oath or affirmation that the statements contained in the application are true to the best of his knowledge and belief.

3. The applicant appears from the application to be a person permitted to apply as provided in section 14-3301, subsection A.

4. On the basis of the statements in the application, venue is proper.

5. An original, duly executed and apparently unrevoked will is in the registrar's possession.

6. Any notice required by section 14-3204 has been given and that the application is not within section 14-3304.

7. It appears from the application that the time limit for original probate has not expired.

B. The application shall be denied if it indicates that a personal representative has been appointed in another county of this state or except as provided in subsection D of this section, if it appears that this or another will of the decedent has been the subject of a previous probate order.

C. A will which appears to have the required signatures and which contains an attestation clause showing that requirements of execution under chapter 2, article 5 of this title have been met shall be probated without further proof. In other cases, the registrar may assume execution if the will appears to have been properly executed, or he may accept a sworn statement or affidavit of any person having knowledge of the circumstances of execution, whether or not the person was a witness to the will.

D. Informal probate of a will which has been previously probated in another jurisdiction may be granted at any time upon written application by any interested person, together with deposit of a certified copy of the will and of the statement probating it from the office or court where it was first probated.

E. A will from a place which does not provide for probate of a will after death and which is not eligible for probate under subsection A of this section may be probated in this state upon receipt by the registrar of a duly authenticated copy of the will and a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy filed is a true copy and that the will has become operative under the law of the other place.

#### Section 14-3304. Informal probate; unavailable in certain cases

An application for informal probate shall be declined if it relates to one or more of a known series of testamentary instruments the latest of which does not expressly revoke the earlier, except that a series consisting of a will with its codicils may be informally probated.

#### Section 14-3305. Informal probate; registrar not satisfied

If the registrar is not satisfied that a will is entitled to be probated in informal proceedings because of failure to meet the requirements of sections 14-3303 and 14-3304 or any other reason, he may decline the application. A declination of informal probate is not an adjudication and does not preclude formal probate proceedings.

#### Section 14-3306. Informal probate; notice requirements

A. The applicant must give notice as described by section 14-1401 of the applicant's application for informal probate:

1. To any person demanding it pursuant to section 14-3204.

2. To any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been terminated.  No other notice need be given before issuance of a statement of informal probate by the registrar.

B. On issuance of a statement of informal probate, the applicant must within thirty days give written information to all heirs and devisees of the admission of the will to probate, together with a copy of the will.  The information shall describe the court where papers relating to the estate are on file and state that an heir or devisee has four months from receipt of the information within which to commence a formal testacy proceeding if the heir or devisee wishes to contest the probate. If a personal representative has been appointed, the information given pursuant to this section may be combined with the information required by section 14-3705 and may in that case be given by either the applicant or the personal representative on behalf of both. This information shall be delivered or sent by mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the applicant.  An heir or devisee to whom the information is given is barred from commencing a formal testacy proceeding to contest the probate of the will after four months have elapsed from receipt of the information, but an heir or devisee is not barred from commencing a formal testacy proceeding to probate a later discovered will. An heir or devisee to whom the information is not given may contest the informal probate within the time limit specified in section 14-3108. The applicant shall be liable to any heir or devisee damaged by failure to comply with this subsection. An applicant's failure to give information as required by this section is a breach of the applicant's duty to the heirs and devisees but does not affect the validity of the probate.

#### Section 14-3307. Informal appointment proceedings; delay in order; duty of registrar; effect of appointment

A. Upon receipt of an application for informal appointment of a personal representative other than a special administrator as provided in section 14-3614, if at least one hundred twenty hours have elapsed since the decedent's death, the registrar, after making the findings required by section 14-3308, shall appoint the applicant subject to qualification and acceptance, except that if the decedent was a nonresident the registrar shall delay the order of appointment until thirty days have elapsed since death unless the personal representative appointed at the decedent's domicile is the applicant or the decedent's will directs that his estate be subject to the laws of this state.

B. The status of personal representative and the powers and duties pertaining to the office are fully established by informal appointment. An appointment, and the office of personal representative created thereby, is subject to termination as provided in sections 14-3608 through 14-3612, but is not subject to retroactive vacation.

#### Section 14-3308. Informal appointment proceedings; proof and findings required

A. In informal appointment proceedings, the registrar must determine whether:

1. The application for informal appointment of a personal representative is complete.

2. The applicant has made oath or affirmation that the statements contained in the application are true to the best of his knowledge and belief.

3. The applicant appears from the application to be a person permitted to apply as provided in section 14-3301, subsection A.

4. On the basis of the statements in the application, venue is proper.

5. Any will to which the requested appointment relates has been or is being simultaneously formally or informally probated, except this requirement does not apply to the appointment of a special administrator.

6. Any notice required by section 14-3204 has been given.

7. From the statements in the application, the person whose appointment is sought has priority entitling him to the appointment.

8. The will, if any, requires supervised administration.

B. Unless section 14-3612 controls, the application must be denied if it indicates any of the following:

1. A personal representative who has not filed a written statement of resignation as provided in section 14-3610, subsection C has been appointed in this or another county of this state.

2. The decedent was not domiciled in this state, a personal representative whose appointment has not been terminated has been appointed by a court in the state of domicile and the applicant is not the domiciliary personal representative or his nominee.

3. Other requirements of this section have not been met.

#### Section 14-3309. Informal appointment proceedings; registrar not satisfied

If the registrar is not satisfied that a requested informal appointment of a personal representative should be made because of failure to meet the requirements of sections 14-3307 and 14-3308, or for any other reason, the registrar may decline the application. A declination of informal appointment is not an adjudication and does not preclude appointment in formal proceedings.

#### Section 14-3310. Informal appointment proceedings; notice requirements

The moving party must give notice as described by section 14-1401 of his intention to seek an appointment informally:

1. To any person demanding it pursuant to section 14-3204.

2. To any person having a prior or equal right to appointment not waived in writing and filed with the court. No other notice of an informal appointment proceeding is required.

#### Section 14-3311. Informal appointment unavailable in certain cases

If an application for informal appointment indicates the existence of a possible unrevoked testamentary instrument which may relate to property subject to the laws of this state, and which is not filed for probate in this court, the registrar shall decline the application.

### Article 4 - Formal Testacy and Appointment Proceedings

#### Section 14-3401. Formal testacy proceedings; nature; when commenced

A. A formal testacy proceeding is litigation to determine whether a decedent left a valid will. A formal testacy proceeding may be commenced by an interested person filing a petition as described in section 14-3402, subsection A in which he requests that the court, after notice and hearing, enter an order probating a will, or a petition to set aside an informal probate of a will or to prevent informal probate of a will which is the subject of a pending application, or a petition in accordance with section 14-3402, subsection B for an order that the decedent died intestate.

B. A petition may seek formal probate of a will without regard to whether the same or a conflicting will has been informally probated. A formal testacy proceeding may involve a request for appointment of a personal representative.

C. During the pendency of a formal testacy proceeding, the registrar shall not act upon any application for informal probate of any will of the decedent or any application for informal appointment of a personal representative of the decedent.

D. Unless a petition in a formal testacy proceeding also requests confirmation of the previous informal appointment, a previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice of the commencement of a formal probate proceeding, must refrain from exercising his power to make any further distribution of the estate during the pendency of the formal proceeding. A petitioner who seeks the appointment of a different personal representative in a formal proceeding also may request an order restraining the acting personal representative from exercising any of the powers of his office and requesting the appointment of a special administrator. In the absence of a request or if the request is denied, the commencement of a formal proceeding has no effect on the powers and duties of a previously appointed personal representative other than those relating to distribution.

#### Section 14-3402. Formal testacy or appointment proceedings; petition; contents

A. Petitions for formal probate of a will, or for adjudication of intestacy with or without request for appointment of a personal representative, must be directed to the court, request a judicial order after notice and hearing and contain further statements as indicated in this section. A petition for formal probate of a will must:

1. Request an order as to the testacy of the decedent in relation to a particular instrument which may or may not have been informally probated and determining the heirs;

2. Contain the statements required for informal applications as stated in paragraph 1 of subsection B of section 14-3301 and the statements required by subdivisions (b) and (c), paragraph 2 of subsection B of section 14-3301; and

3. State whether the original of the last will of the decedent is in the possession of the court or accompanies the petition. If the original will or a certified copy of a will probated in another jurisdiction neither is in the possession of the court nor accompanies the petition, the petition also must state the contents of the will, and indicate that it is lost, destroyed or otherwise unavailable.

B. A petition for adjudication of intestacy and appointment of an administrator in intestacy must request a judicial finding and order that the decedent left no will and determining the heirs, contain the statements required by paragraphs 1 and 4 of subsection B of section 14-3301 and indicate whether supervised administration is sought. A petition may request an order determining intestacy and heirs without requesting the appointment of an administrator, in which case, the statements required by subdivision (b), paragraph 4 of subsection B of section 14-3301 may be omitted.

#### Section 14-3403. Formal testacy proceeding; notice of hearing on petition

A. On commencement of a formal testacy proceeding, the clerk shall fix a time and place of hearing. Notice shall be given in the manner prescribed by section 14-1401 by the petitioner to the persons specified in this section and to any additional person who has filed a demand for notice under section 14-3204. Notice shall be given to the following persons: the surviving spouse, children and other heirs of the decedent, the devisees and executors named in any will that is being, or has been, probated, or offered for informal or formal probate in the county, or that is known by the petitioner to have been probated, or offered for informal or formal probate in another jurisdiction, and any personal representative of the decedent whose appointment has not been terminated.  Notice may be given to other persons. To the extent that the petitioner is not otherwise required by section 14-1401 to give notice by publication, the petitioner shall give notice by publication in the manner prescribed by section 14-1401, subsection A, paragraph 3 to all unknown persons.

B. If it appears by the petition or otherwise that the fact of the death of the alleged decedent may be in doubt, or on the written demand of any interested person, a copy of the notice of the hearing on the petition shall be sent by registered mail to the alleged decedent at the decedent's last known address. The court shall direct the petitioner to report the results of, or make and report back concerning, a reasonably diligent search for the alleged decedent in any manner that may seem advisable, including any or all of the following methods:

1. By inserting in one or more suitable periodicals a notice requesting information from any person having knowledge of the whereabouts of the alleged decedent.

2. By notifying law enforcement officials and public welfare agencies in appropriate locations of the disappearance of the alleged decedent.

3. By engaging the services of an investigator. The costs of any search so directed shall be paid by the petitioner if there is no administration or by the estate of the decedent in case there is administration.

#### Section 14-3404. Formal testacy proceedings; written objections to probate

Any party to a formal proceeding who opposes the probate of a will for any reason shall state in his pleadings his objections to probate of the will.

#### Section 14-3405. Formal testacy proceedings; uncontested cases; hearings and proof

If a petition in a testacy proceeding is unopposed, the court may order probate or intestacy on the strength of the pleadings if satisfied that the conditions of section 14-3409 have been met, or conduct a hearing in open court and require proof of the matters necessary to support the order sought. If evidence concerning execution of the will is necessary, the affidavit or testimony of one of any attesting witnesses to the instrument is sufficient. If the affidavit or testimony of an attesting witness is not available, execution of the will may be proved by other evidence or affidavit.

#### Section 14-3406. Formal testacy proceedings; contested cases; testimony of attesting witnesses

A. If evidence concerning execution of an attested will which is not self-proved is necessary in contested cases, the testimony of at least one of the attesting witnesses, if within the state, competent and able to testify, is required. Due execution of an attested or unattested will may be proved by other evidence.

B. If the will is self-proved, compliance with signature requirements for execution is conclusively presumed and other requirements of execution are presumed subject to rebuttal without the testimony of any witness upon filing the will and the acknowledgment and affidavits annexed or attached thereto, unless there is proof of fraud or forgery affecting the acknowledgment or affidavit.

#### Section 14-3407. Formal testacy proceedings; burdens in contested cases

In contested cases, petitioners who seek to establish intestacy have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death, venue and heirship. Proponents of a will, if they are also petitioners, have the burden of establishing prima facie proof of death and venue.  If a will is opposed by a petition for a declaration of intestacy, it shall be determined first whether the will is entitled to probate.

 

#### Section 14-3408. Formal testacy proceedings; will construction; effect of final order in another jurisdiction

A final order of a court of another state determining testacy, the validity or construction of a will, made in a proceeding involving notice to and an opportunity for contest by all interested persons must be accepted as determinative by the courts of this state if it includes, or is based upon, a finding that the decedent was domiciled at his death in the state where the order was made.

#### Section 14-3409. Formal testacy proceedings; order; foreign will

After the time required for any notice has expired, upon proof of notice, and after any hearing that may be necessary, if the court finds that the testator is dead, venue is proper and that the proceeding was commenced within the limitation prescribed by section 14-3108, it shall determine the decedent's domicile at death, his heirs and his state of testacy. Any will found to be valid and unrevoked shall be formally probated. Termination of any previous informal appointment of a personal representative, which may be appropriate in view of the relief requested and findings, is governed by section 14-3612. The petition shall be dismissed or appropriate amendment allowed if the court is not satisfied that the alleged decedent is dead. A will from a place which does not provide for probate of a will after death, may be proved for probate in this state by a duly authenticated certificate of its legal custodian that the copy introduced is a true copy and that the will has become effective under the law of the other place.

#### Section 14-3410. Formal testacy proceedings; probate of more than one instrument

If two or more instruments are offered for probate before a final order is entered in a formal testacy proceeding, more than one instrument may be probated if neither expressly revokes the other or contains provisions which work a total revocation by implication. If more than one instrument is probated, the order shall indicate what provisions control in respect to the nomination of an executor, if any. The order may, but need not, indicate how any provisions of a particular instrument are affected by the other instrument. After a final order in a testacy proceeding has been entered, no petition for probate of any other instrument of the decedent may be entertained, except incident to a petition to vacate or modify a previous probate order and subject to the time limits of section 14-3412.

#### Section 14-3411. Formal testacy proceedings; partial intestacy

If it becomes evident in the course of a formal testacy proceeding that, though one or more instruments are entitled to be probated, the decedent's estate is or may be partially intestate, the court shall enter an order to that effect.

#### Section 14-3412. Formal testacy proceedings; effect of order; vacation

A. Subject to appeal and subject to vacation as provided in this section and in section 14-3413, a formal testacy order under sections 14-3409 through 14-3411, including an order that the decedent left no valid will and determining heirs, is final as to all persons with respect to all issues concerning the decedent's estate that the court considered or might have considered incident to its rendition relevant to the question of whether the decedent left a valid will, and to the determination of heirs, except that:

1. Not later than sixty days after entry of a formal testacy order probating a will or a formal adjudication of intestacy, any interested person who did not oppose the probate of the will or the allegations of intestacy at the original hearing may petition the court to vacate its order and reopen the matter; the court shall thereupon fix a time and place of hearing, with notice to the heirs, the devisees named in the will, the personal representative, and other persons as directed by the court. The court shall proceed as in any contested testacy case; the court may vacate the original order and make a new order determining the decedent's state of testacy, or deny the petition to vacate and confirm the original order.

2. The court shall entertain a petition for modification or vacation of its order and probate of another will of the decedent if it is shown that the proponents of the later-offered will were unaware of its existence at the time of the earlier proceeding or were unaware of the earlier proceeding and were given no notice thereof, except by publication.

3. If intestacy of all or part of the estate has been ordered, the determination of heirs of the decedent may be reconsidered if it is shown that one or more persons were omitted from the determination and it is also shown that the persons were unaware of their relationship to the decedent, were unaware of his death or were given no notice of any proceeding concerning his estate, except by publication.

4. A petition for vacation under either paragraph 2 or 3 of this subsection must be filed prior to the earlier of the following time limits:

(a) If a personal representative has been appointed for the estate, the time of entry of any order approving final distribution of the estate, or, if the estate is closed by statement, six months after the filing of the closing statement.

(b) Whether or not a personal representative has been appointed for the estate of the decedent, the time prescribed by section 14-3108 when it is no longer possible to initiate an original proceeding to probate a will of the decedent.

(c) Twelve months after the entry of the order sought to be vacated.

5. The order originally rendered in the testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated, if appropriate under the circumstances, by the order of probate of the later-offered will or the order redetermining heirs.

6. The finding of the fact of death is conclusive as to the alleged decedent only if notice of the hearing on the petition in the formal testacy proceeding was sent by registered or certified mail addressed to the alleged decedent at his last known address and the court finds that a search under section 14-3403, subsection B was made.

B. If the alleged decedent is not dead, even if notice was sent and search was made, he may recover estate assets in the hands of the personal representative. In addition to any remedies available to the alleged decedent by reason of any fraud or intentional wrongdoing, the alleged decedent may recover any estate or its proceeds from distributees that is in their hands, or the value of distributions received by them, to the extent that any recovery from distributees is equitable in view of the circumstances.

#### Section 14-3413. Formal testacy proceedings; vacation of order for other cause

For good cause shown, an order in a formal testacy proceeding may be modified or vacated within the time allowed for appeal.

#### Section 14-3414. Formal proceedings concerning appointment of personal representative

A. A formal proceeding for adjudication regarding the priority or qualification of one who is an applicant for appointment as personal representative, or of one who previously has been appointed personal representative in informal proceedings, if an issue concerning the testacy of the decedent is or may be involved, is governed by section 14-3402, as well as by this section. In other cases, the petition shall contain or adopt the statements required by section 14-3301, subsection B, paragraph 1 and describe the question relating to priority or qualification of the personal representative which is to be resolved. If the proceeding precedes any appointment of a personal representative, it shall stay any pending informal appointment proceedings as well as any commenced thereafter. If the proceeding is commenced after appointment, the previously appointed personal representative, after receipt of notice thereof, shall refrain from exercising any power of administration except as necessary to preserve the estate or unless the court orders otherwise.

B. After notice to interested persons, including all persons interested in the administration of the estate as successors under the applicable assumption concerning testacy, any previously appointed personal representative and any person having or claiming priority for appointment as personal representative, the court shall determine who is entitled to appointment under section 14-3203, make a proper appointment and, if appropriate, terminate any prior appointment found to have been improper as provided in cases of removal under section 14-3611.

#### Section 14-3415. Lost and missing wills; wills probated in other jurisdictions

A. If an original will that was last seen in the possession of the testator cannot be found after the testator's death, the testator is presumed to have destroyed the will with the intention of revoking it. This presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. If this presumption arises and is not rebutted the will is revoked.

B. If a will is found to be valid and unrevoked and the original will is not available, its contents can be proved by a copy of the will and the testimony of at least one credible witness that the copy is a true copy of the original. It is not necessary for this person to be an attesting witness to the will.

C. If a will is found to be valid and unrevoked and a copy of the will is not available, its contents can be proved only by clear and convincing evidence. For this purpose it is not necessary for a witness to be an attesting witness to the will. On a finding of clear and convincing evidence of the contents of such a will, the court, by order, shall set forth the contents of the will in reasonable detail.

D. If a certified copy of the will, as probated in another jurisdiction, is not available, the contents of the will can be proved by a copy of the will and the testimony of at least one credible witness that the copy is a true copy of the original, as probated in the other jurisdiction. It is not necessary for this person to be an attesting witness to the will.

### Article 5 - Supervised Administration

#### Section 14-3501. Supervised administration; nature of proceeding

Supervised administration is a single in rem proceeding to secure complete administration and settlement of a decedent's estate under the continuing authority of the court which extends until entry of an order approving distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative or other order terminating the proceeding. A supervised personal representative is responsible to the court, as well as to the interested parties, and is subject to directions concerning the estate made by the court on its own motion or on the motion of any interested party. Except as otherwise provided in this article, or as otherwise ordered by the court, a supervised personal representative has the same duties and powers as a personal representative who is not supervised.

#### Section 14-3502. Supervised administration; petition; order

A petition for supervised administration may be filed by any interested person or by a personal representative at any time or the prayer for supervised administration may be joined with a petition in a testacy or appointment proceeding. If the testacy of the decedent and the priority and qualification of any personal representative have not been adjudicated previously, the petition for supervised administration shall include the matters required of a petition in a formal testacy proceeding and the notice requirements and procedures applicable to a formal testacy proceeding apply. If not previously adjudicated, the court shall adjudicate the testacy of the decedent and questions relating to the priority and qualifications of the personal representative in any case involving a request for supervised administration, even though the request for supervised administration may be denied. After notice to interested persons, the court shall order supervised administration of a decedent's estate:

1. If the decedent's will directs supervised administration, it shall be ordered unless the court finds that circumstances bearing on the need for supervised administration have changed since the execution of the will and that there is no necessity for supervised administration.

2. If the decedent's will directs unsupervised administration, supervised administration shall be ordered only upon a finding that it is necessary for protection of persons interested in the estate.

3. In other cases if the court finds that supervised administration is necessary under the circumstances.

#### Section 14-3503. Supervised administration; effect on other proceedings

A. The pendency of a proceeding for supervised administration of a decedent's estate stays action on any informal application then pending or thereafter filed.

B. If a will has been previously probated in informal proceedings, the effect of the filing of a petition for supervised administration is as provided for formal testacy proceedings by section 14-3401.

C. After he has received notice of the filing of a petition for supervised administration, a personal representative who has been appointed previously shall not exercise his power to distribute any estate. The filing of the petition does not affect his other powers and duties unless the court restricts the exercise of any of them pending full hearing on the petition.

#### Section 14-3504. Supervised administration; powers of personal representative

Unless restricted by the court, a supervised personal representative has, without interim orders approving exercise of a power, all powers of personal representatives under this title, but all sales of real property shall be subject to court confirmation and the personal representative shall not exercise his power to make any distribution of the estate without prior order of the court. Any other restriction on the power of a personal representative which may be ordered by the court must be endorsed on his letters of appointment and, unless so endorsed, is ineffective as to persons dealing in good faith with the personal representative.

#### Section 14-3505. Supervised administration; interim orders; distribution and closing orders; annual accounts; accounting on closing

A. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, supervised administration is terminated by order in accordance with time restrictions, notices and contents of orders prescribed for proceedings under section 14-3931. Interim orders approving or directing partial distributions or granting other relief may be issued by the court at any time during the pendency of a supervised administration on the application of the personal representative or any interested person.

B. A supervised personal representative shall file an account with the court not less than annually during his administration, and on closing shall file a final account to be approved under section 14-3931. He shall also account to the court on resignation or removal. Subject to appeal or vacation within the time permitted, an order made on notice and hearing allowing an intermediate account of a personal representative adjudicates his liabilities concerning matters considered in connection therewith. A copy of the intermediate account must be sent to all interested parties along with notice of hearing on the account. In connection with any account, the court may require the personal representative to submit to physical check of the estate in his control, to be made in any manner the court may specify.

### Article 6 - Personal Representative; Appointment, Control and Termination of Authority

#### Section 14-3601. Qualification

Prior to receiving letters, a personal representative shall qualify by filing with the appointing court any required bond and a statement of acceptance of the duties of the office.

#### Section 14-3602. Acceptance of appointment; consent to jurisdiction

By accepting appointment, a personal representative submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted by any interested person. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the personal representative, or mailed to him by ordinary first class mail at his address as listed in the application or petition for appointment or as thereafter reported to the court and to his address as then known to the petitioner.

#### Section 14-3603. Bond required; exceptions

A. A bond is required of a personal representative unless either:

1. The will expressly waives the bond.

2. All of the heirs if no will has been probated, or all of the devisees under a will that does not provide for waiver of the bond, file with the court a written waiver of the bond requirement. A duly appointed guardian or conservator may waive on behalf of the ward or protected person unless the guardian or conservator is the personal representative.

3. The personal representative is a national banking association, a holder of a banking permit under the laws of this state, a savings and loan association authorized to conduct trust business in this state, a title insurance company that is qualified to do business under the laws of this state, a trust company holding a certificate to engage in trust business from the deputy director of the financial institutions division of the department of insurance and financial institutions or the public fiduciary.

4. The petition for formal or informal appointment alleges that the probable value of the entire estate will allow summary procedures under section 14-3973 and the surviving spouse, or the nominee of the surviving spouse, is applying for appointment as personal representative.

B. In any case where a bond is not required under subsection A of this section, the court, on petition of any interested person and on reasonable proof that the interest of the petitioning person is in danger of being lost because of the administration of the estate, may require a bond in such an amount as the court may direct to protect the interest of the petitioner or of the petitioner and others. An heir or devisee who initially waived bond may be a petitioner under this subsection.

C. If a bond is not initially required because the petition for appointment alleges that the probable value of the entire estate will allow summary procedures under section 14-3973, and it later appears from the inventory and appraisal that the value of the estate will not allow use of such procedures, then the personal representative must promptly file a bond unless one is not required for some other reason under subsection A of this section.

#### Section 14-3604. Bond amount; security; procedure; reduction

A. If bond is required and the provisions of the will or order do not specify the amount, unless stated in his application or petition, the person qualifying shall file a statement under oath with the registrar indicating his best estimate of the value of the personal estate of the decedent, real estate, less encumbrances thereon and of the income expected from the personal and real estate during the next year, and he shall execute and file a bond with the registrar, or give other suitable security, in an amount not less than the estimate provided, however, that said bond may be reduced by the amount of any real estate, less encumbrances thereon, if the letters issued to the personal representative contain the restriction that sales of real property by the personal representative are subject to court confirmation. The registrar shall determine that the bond is duly executed by a corporate surety, or one or more individual sureties whose performance is secured by pledge of personal property, mortgage on real property or other adequate security. The registrar may permit the amount of the bond to be reduced by the value of assets of the estate deposited with the clerk of the court or a domestic financial institution, as defined in section 14-6101, in a manner that prevents their unauthorized disposition. On petition of the personal representative or another interested person the court may excuse a requirement of bond, increase or reduce the amount of the bond, release sureties, or permit the substitution of another bond with the same or different sureties.

B. When a surety of a personal representative desires to be released from responsibility for future acts, he may apply to the court for a release. The court shall cause a citation to be issued to the personal representative, requiring him to appear at a time and place therein specified, and to give other security. Notice shall be given to the personal representative as provided in section 14-3602. If new security is given and approved by the judge he may thereupon order that the surety who applied for release shall not be liable on his bond for any subsequent act, default or misconduct of the personal representative. If the personal representative neglects or refuses to give new and sufficient security on the return of the citation, or within such reasonable time as the judge allows, unless the surety making the application consents to an extension of time, the court shall revoke the letters.

#### Section 14-3606. Terms and conditions of bonds

A. The following requirements and provisions apply to any bond required by this article:

1. Bonds shall name the state as obligee for the benefit of the persons interested in the estate and shall be conditioned upon the faithful discharge by the fiduciary of all duties according to law.

2. Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the approved bond, sureties are jointly and severally liable with the personal representative and with each other. The address of sureties shall be stated in the bond.

3. By executing an approved bond of a personal representative, the surety consents to the jurisdiction of the court which issued letters to the primary obligor in any proceedings pertaining to the fiduciary duties of the personal representative and naming the surety as a party. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the surety or mailed to him by registered or certified mail at his address as listed with the court where the bond is filed and to his address as then known to the petitioner.

4. On petition of a successor personal representative, any other personal representative of the same decedent, or any interested person, a proceeding in the court may be initiated against a surety for breach of the obligation of the bond of the personal representative.

5. The bond of the personal representative is not void after the first recovery but may be proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.

B. No action or proceeding may be commenced against the surety on any matter as to which an action or proceeding against the primary obligor is barred by adjudication or limitation.

#### Section 14-3607. Order restraining personal representative

A. On petition of any person who appears to have an interest in the estate, the court by temporary order may restrain a personal representative from performing specified acts of administration, disbursement or distribution, or may exercise any powers or discharge any duties of his office, or may make any other order to secure proper performance of his duty, if it appears to the court that the personal representative otherwise may take some action which would jeopardize unreasonably the interest of the applicant or of some other interested person. Persons with whom the personal representative may transact business may be made parties.

B. The matter shall be set for hearing within ten days unless the parties otherwise agree. Notice as the court directs shall be given to the personal representative and his attorney of record, if any, and to any other parties named defendant in the petition.

#### Section 14-3608. Termination of appointment; general

Termination of appointment of a personal representative occurs as indicated in sections 14-3609 through 14-3612. Termination ends the right and power pertaining to the office of personal representative as conferred by this title or any will, except that a personal representative, at any time prior to distribution or until restrained or enjoined by court order, may perform acts necessary to protect the estate and may deliver the assets to a successor representative. Termination does not discharge a personal representative from liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination, or relieve him of the duty to preserve assets subject to his control, to account therefor and to deliver the assets. Termination does not affect the jurisdiction of the court over the personal representative, but terminates his authority to represent the estate in any pending or future proceeding.

#### Section 14-3609. Termination of appointment; death or disability

The death of a personal representative or the appointment of a conservator for the estate of a personal representative, terminates his appointment. Until appointment and qualification of a successor or special representative to replace the deceased or protected representative, the representative of the estate of the deceased or protected personal representative, if any, has the duty to protect the estate possessed and being administered by his decedent or ward at the time his appointment terminates, has the power to perform acts necessary for protection and shall account for and deliver the estate assets to a successor or special personal representative upon his appointment and qualification.

#### Section 14-3610. Termination of appointment; voluntary

A. An appointment of a personal representative terminates as provided in section 14-3933, one year after the filing of a closing statement.

B. An order closing an estate as provided in section 14-3931 or 14-3932 terminates an appointment of a personal representative.

C. A personal representative may resign his position by filing a written statement of resignation with the registrar after he has given at least fifteen days written notice to the persons known to be interested in the estate. If no one applies or petitions for appointment of a successor representative within the time indicated in the notice, the filed statement of resignation is ineffective as a termination of appointment and in any event is effective only upon the appointment and qualification of a successor representative and delivery of the assets to him.

#### Section 14-3611. Termination of appointment by removal; cause; procedure

A. A person interested in the estate may petition for removal of a personal representative for cause at any time. On filing of the petition, the court shall fix a time and place for a hearing. Notice shall be given by the petitioner to the personal representative, and to other persons as the court may order. Except as otherwise ordered as provided in section 14-3607, after receipt of notice of removal proceedings, the personal representative shall not act except to account, to correct maladministration or to preserve the estate. If removal is ordered, the court also shall direct by order the disposition of the assets remaining in the name of, or under the control of, the personal representative being removed.

B. Cause for removal exists under any of the following circumstances:

1. If removal would be in the best interests of the estate.

2. If it is shown that a personal representative or the person seeking the personal representative's appointment intentionally misrepresented material facts in the proceedings leading to the personal representative's appointment.

3. If it is shown that the personal representative has disregarded an order of the court, has become incapable of discharging the duties of that office, has mismanaged the estate or has failed to perform any duty pertaining to that office.

4. If it is shown that the personal representative has disregarded the reasonable written wishes of the decedent regarding the disposition of the decedent's remains.

C. Unless the decedent's will directs otherwise, a personal representative appointed at the decedent's domicile, incident to securing appointment of himself or his nominee as ancillary personal representative, may obtain removal of another who was appointed personal representative in this state to administer local assets.

#### Section 14-3612. Termination of appointment; change of testacy status

Except as otherwise ordered in formal proceedings, the probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of a personal representative in intestacy or under a will which is superseded by formal probate of another will, or the vacation of an informal probate of a will subsequent to the appointment of the personal representative thereunder, does not terminate the appointment of the personal representative although his powers may be reduced as provided in section 14-3401. Termination occurs upon appointment in informal or formal appointment proceedings of a person entitled to appointment under the later assumption concerning testacy. If no request for new appointment is made within thirty days after expiration of time for appeal from the order in formal testacy proceedings, or from the informal probate, changing the assumption concerning testacy, the previously appointed personal representative upon request may be appointed personal representative under the subsequently probated will, or as in intestacy as the case may be.

#### Section 14-3613. Successor personal representative

Articles 3 and 4 of this chapter govern proceedings for appointment of a personal representative to succeed one whose appointment has been terminated. After appointment and qualification, a successor personal representative may be substituted in all actions and proceedings to which the former personal representative was a party, and no notice, process or claim which was given or served upon the former personal representative need be given to or served upon the successor in order to preserve any position or right the person giving the notice or filing the claim may thereby have obtained or preserved with reference to the former personal representative. Except as otherwise ordered by the court, the successor personal representative has the powers and duties in respect to the continued administration which the former personal representative would have had if his appointment had not been terminated.

#### Section 14-3614. Special administrator; appointment

A special administrator may be appointed:

1. Informally by the registrar on the application of any interested person when necessary to protect the estate of a decedent prior to the appointment of a general personal representative or if a prior appointment has been terminated as provided in section 14-3609.

2. In a formal proceeding by order of the court on the petition of any interested person and finding, after notice and hearing, that appointment is necessary to preserve the estate or to secure its proper administration including its administration in circumstances where a general personal representative cannot or should not act. If it appears to the court that an emergency exists, appointment may be ordered without notice.

#### Section 14-3615. Special administrator; who may be appointed

A. If a special administrator is to be appointed pending the probate of a will which is the subject of a pending application or petition for probate, the person named executor in the will shall be appointed if available, and qualified.

B. In other cases, any proper person may be appointed special administrator.

#### Section 14-3616. Special administrator; appointed informally; powers and duties

A special administrator appointed by the registrar in informal proceedings pursuant to section 14-3614, paragraph 1 has the duty to collect and manage the assets of the estate, to preserve them, to account therefor and to deliver them to the general personal representative upon his qualification. The special administrator has the power of a personal representative under this title necessary to perform his duties.

#### Section 14-3617. Special administrator; formal proceedings; power and duties

A special administrator appointed by order of the court in any formal proceeding has the power of a general personal representative except as limited in the appointment and duties as prescribed in the order. The appointment may be for a specified time, to perform particular acts or on other terms as the court may direct.

#### Section 14-3618. Termination of appointment; special administrator

The appointment of a special administrator terminates in accordance with the provisions of the order of appointment or on the appointment of a general personal representative. In other cases, the appointment of a special administrator is subject to termination as provided in sections 14-3608 through 14-3611.

### Article 7 - Duties and Powers of Personal Representatives

#### Section 14-3701. Time of accrual of duties and powers

The duties and powers of a personal representative commence on appointment. The powers of a personal representative relate back in time to give acts by the person appointed which are beneficial to the estate occurring prior to appointment the same effect as those occurring thereafter. Prior to appointment, a person named personal representative in a will may carry out written instructions of the decedent relating to the decedent's body, funeral and burial arrangements. A personal representative may ratify and accept acts on behalf of the estate done by others where the acts would have been proper for a personal representative.

#### Section 14-3702. Priority among different letters

A person to whom general letters are issued first has exclusive authority under the letters until his appointment is terminated or modified. If, through error, general letters are afterwards issued to another, the first appointed representative may recover any property of the estate in the hands of the representative subsequently appointed, but the acts of the latter done in good faith before notice of the first letters are not void for want of validity of appointment.

#### Section 14-3703. General duties; relation and liability to persons interested in estate; standing to sue

A. Except as provided in the will of the decedent, a personal representative is a fiduciary who shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees as described by sections 14-10804 and 14-10806 and the duties of accounting applicable to trustees as provided in section 14-10813, subsection C. A personal representative is under a duty to settle and distribute the estate of the decedent in accordance with the terms of any probated and effective will and this title, and as expeditiously and efficiently as is consistent with the best interests of the estate.  The personal representative shall use the authority conferred by this title, the terms of the will, if any, and any order in proceedings to which the personal representative is a party for the best interests of successors to the estate.

B. A personal representative shall not be surcharged for acts of administration or distribution if the conduct in question was authorized at the time. Subject to other obligations of administration, an informally probated will is authority to administer and distribute the estate according to its terms. An order of appointment of a personal representative, whether issued in informal or formal proceedings, is authority to distribute apparently intestate assets to the heirs of the decedent if, at the time of distribution, the personal representative is not aware of a pending testacy proceeding, a proceeding to vacate an order entered in an earlier testacy proceeding, a formal proceeding questioning the personal representative's appointment or fitness to continue, or a supervised administration proceeding. Nothing in this section affects the duty of the personal representative to administer and distribute the estate in accordance with the rights of claimants, the surviving spouse, any minor children, any dependent children and any pretermitted child of the decedent as described elsewhere in this title.

C. Except as to proceedings that do not survive the death of the decedent, a personal representative of a decedent domiciled in this state at death has the same standing to sue and be sued in the courts of this state and the courts of any other jurisdiction as the decedent had immediately prior to death.

 

#### Section 14-3704. Personal representative to proceed without court order; exception

A personal representative shall proceed expeditiously with the settlement and distribution of a decedent's estate and, except as otherwise specified or ordered in regard to a supervised personal representative, do so without adjudication, order or direction of the court, but he may invoke the jurisdiction of the court, in proceedings authorized by this title, to resolve questions concerning the estate or its administration.

#### Section 14-3705. Duty of personal representative; information to heirs and devisees

Not later than thirty days after appointment every personal representative, except any special administrator, shall give information of the appointment to the heirs and devisees, including, if there has been no formal testacy proceeding and if the personal representative was appointed on the assumption that the decedent died intestate, the devisees in any will mentioned in the application for appointment of a personal representative. The information shall be delivered or sent by first class mail to each of the heirs and devisees whose address is reasonably available to the personal representative. If appointment is made in a formal proceeding, information under this section need not be given to persons given notice of the formal proceeding. The duty does not extend to require information to persons who have been adjudicated in a prior formal testacy proceeding to have no interest in the estate. The information shall include the name and address of the personal representative, indicate that it is being sent to persons who have or may have some interest in the estate being administered, indicate whether a bond has been filed and describe the court where papers relating to the estate are on file. The personal representative's failure to give this information is a breach of the personal representative's duty to the persons concerned but does not affect the validity of the appointment or the personal representative's powers or other duties. A personal representative may inform other persons of the appointment by delivery or first class mail. The personal representative shall comply with the provisions of title 43, chapter 13.

#### Section 14-3706. Duty of personal representative; inventory and appraisement

A. Within ninety days after his appointment, a personal representative, who is not a special administrator or a successor to another representative who has previously discharged this duty, shall prepare an inventory of property owned by the decedent at the time of his death, listing it with reasonable detail, and indicating as to each listed item, its fair market value as of the date of the decedent's death, its nature as community or separate property and the type and amount of any encumbrance that may exist with reference to any item.

B. The personal representative may file the original of the inventory with the court and send a copy of the inventory only to interested persons who request it; or, if he elects not to file the inventory with the court, he must deliver or mail a copy of the inventory to each of the heirs in an intestate estate, or to each of the devisees if a will has been probated, and to any other interested persons who request it.

#### Section 14-3707. Employment of appraisers

The personal representative may employ a qualified and disinterested appraiser to assist him in ascertaining the fair market value as of the date of the decedent's death of any asset the value of which may be subject to reasonable doubt. Different persons may be employed to appraise different kinds of assets included in the estate. The names and addresses of any appraiser shall be indicated on the inventory with the item or items he appraised.

#### Section 14-3708. Duty of personal representative; supplementary inventory

If any property not included in the original inventory comes to the knowledge of a personal representative or if the personal representative learns that the value or description indicated in the original inventory for any item is erroneous or misleading, he shall make a supplementary inventory or appraisement showing the market value as of the date of the decedent's death of the new item or the revised market value or descriptions, and the appraisers or other data relied upon, if any, and file it with the court if the original inventory was filed, or furnish copies thereof or information thereof to persons interested in the new information.

#### Section 14-3709. Duty of personal representative; possession of estate; discovery of concealed assets

A. Except as otherwise provided by a decedent's will, every personal representative has a right to, and shall take possession or control of, the decedent's property, except that any real property or tangible personal property may be left with or surrendered to the person presumptively entitled to it unless or until, in the judgment of the personal representative, possession of the property by the personal representative will be necessary for purposes of administration. The request by a personal representative for delivery of any property possessed by an heir or devisee is conclusive evidence, in any action against the heir or devisee for possession of the property, that the possession of the property by the personal representative is necessary for purposes of administration. The personal representative shall pay taxes on, and take all steps reasonably necessary for the management, protection and preservation of, the estate in the personal representative's possession. The personal representative may maintain an action to recover possession of property or to determine its title.

B. If the personal representative or other person interested in the estate of a decedent complains to the court, on oath, that a person is suspected of having concealed, embezzled, conveyed or disposed of any property of a decedent, or possesses or has knowledge of deeds, bonds, contracts or other writings which contain evidence of or tend to disclose the right, interest or claim of a decedent to any property, or the will of a decedent, the court may cite that person to appear before the court and may examine that person on oath on the complaint. If that person is not in the county where letters have been issued, the person may be cited and examined before the court in the county where the person is found or the court issuing the citation. If the person appears and the court determines that the claim is unfounded, the court shall allow that person necessary expenses out of the estate.

C. If the person cited as provided by subsection B refuses to appear and submit to an examination, or to answer questions relevant to the complaint, the court may commit that person to jail until the person submits to the order of the court or is discharged according to law.

D. If on examination or from other evidence adduced at the hearing it appears that a person has concealed, embezzled, conveyed or disposed of any property of a decedent, or possesses or has knowledge of deeds, bonds, contracts or other writings tending to disclose the right, interest or claim of a decedent to any property, or the will of a decedent, the court may order that person to turn over the documents or disclose knowledge to the personal representative and may commit the person cited to jail until the order is complied with or the person is discharged according to law. The examination shall be reduced to writing and filed in court. The order for the disclosure made on this examination is prima facie evidence of the right of the personal representative to the property in an action brought for recovery of that property, and a judgment shall be for double the value of the property, or for return of the property and damages in addition to the property equal to the value of the property. The court may also award reasonable attorney fees and costs.

#### Section 14-3710. Power to avoid transfers; action to set aside fraudulent conveyances

A. The property liable for the payment of unsecured debts of a decedent includes all property transferred by him by any means which is in law void or voidable as against his creditors and subject to prior liens. The right to recover this property, so far as necessary for the payment of unsecured debts of the decedent, is exclusively in the personal representative.

B. When there is a deficiency of assets in custody of a personal representative, and decedent in his lifetime has conveyed or transferred property, or any rights or interests therein, with intent to defraud creditors, or to avoid a right, debt or duty of any person, or has conveyed or transferred the property so that the conveyance or transfer by law is void or voidable as against creditors, the personal representative shall commence and prosecute an action for the recovery of the property for the benefit of the creditors, and shall recover property which has been so conveyed or transferred, whatever may have been the manner of the conveyance or transfer.

C. The personal representative is not bound to bring the action unless the creditors pay such part of the costs and expenses of the action, or give such surety to the personal representative therefor as the court on application by the creditors may direct.

D. The property recovered shall be subject to payment of the debts of decedent as other property in custody of the personal representative.

#### Section 14-3711. Powers of personal representatives; in general

Until termination of his appointment a personal representative has the same power over the title to property of the estate that an absolute owner would have, in trust however, for the benefit of the creditors and others interested in the estate. This power may be exercised without notice, hearing or order of court.

#### Section 14-3712. Improper exercise of power; breach of fiduciary duty

If the exercise of power concerning the estate is improper, the personal representative is liable to interested persons for damage or loss resulting from breach of his fiduciary duty to the same extent as a trustee of an express trust. The rights of purchasers and others dealing with a personal representative shall be determined as provided in sections 14-3713 and 14-3714.

#### Section 14-3713. Sale, encumbrance or transaction involving conflict of interest; voidable; exceptions

Any sale or encumbrance to the personal representative, his spouse, agent or attorney, or any corporation or trust in which he has a substantial beneficial interest, or any transaction which is affected by a substantial conflict of interest on the part of the personal representative, is voidable by any person interested in the estate except one who has consented after fair disclosure, unless either:

1. The will or a contract entered into by the decedent expressly authorized the transaction.

2. The transaction is approved by the court after notice to interested persons.

#### Section 14-3714. Persons dealing with personal representative; protection

A person who in good faith either assists or deals with another person acting as a personal representative, on the basis of a copy of letters certified by or under the direction of the court or an officer thereof within sixty days of the transaction, is protected as if the personal representative properly exercised his power and even though the authority of that person as personal representative has been terminated. The fact that a person knowingly deals with one who purports to act as a personal representative does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power, the propriety of its exercise, or the current authority of the purported personal representative. Except for restrictions on powers of supervised personal representatives which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 14-3504, no provision in any will or order of court purporting to limit the power of a personal representative is effective except as to persons with actual knowledge thereof. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a personal representative. The protection here expressed extends to instances in which some procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters, including a case in which the alleged decedent is found to be alive. The protection here expressed is not by substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries. If property is wrongfully transferred by a person acting as a personal representative to a person who is not in good faith, any person who subsequently purchases the property in good faith is protected as if the original transferee dealt in good faith.

#### Section 14-3715. Transactions authorized for personal representatives; exceptions

Except as restricted or otherwise provided by the will or by an order in a formal proceeding and subject to the priorities stated in section 14-3902, a personal representative, acting reasonably for the benefit of the interested persons, may properly:

1. Retain assets owned by the decedent pending distribution or liquidation including those in which the representative is personally interested or which are otherwise improper for trust investment.

2. Receive assets from fiduciaries or other sources.

3. Perform, compromise or refuse performance of the decedent's contracts that continue as obligations of the estate, as he may determine under the circumstances. In performing enforceable contracts by the decedent to convey or lease land, the personal representative, among other possible courses of action, may either:

(a) Execute and deliver a deed of conveyance for cash payment of all sums remaining due or the purchaser's note for the sum remaining due secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on the land.

(b) Deliver a deed in escrow with directions that the proceeds, when paid in accordance with the escrow agreement, be paid to the successors of the decedent, as designated in the escrow agreement.

4. Satisfy written charitable pledges of the decedent irrespective of whether the pledges constituted binding obligations of the decedent or were properly presented as claims, if in the judgment of the personal representative the decedent would have wanted the pledges completed under the circumstances.

5. If funds are not needed to meet debts and expenses currently payable and are not immediately distributable, deposit or invest liquid assets of the estate, including monies received from the sale of other assets, in federally insured interest-bearing accounts, readily marketable secured loan arrangements or other prudent investments which would be reasonable for use by trustees generally.

6. Acquire or dispose of an asset, including land in this or another state, for cash or on credit and at public or private sale and manage, develop, improve, exchange, partition, change the character of or abandon an estate asset.

7. Make ordinary or extraordinary repairs or alterations in buildings or other structures, demolish any improvements, raze existing or erect new party walls or buildings.

8. Subdivide, develop or dedicate land to public use, make or obtain the vacation of plats and adjust boundaries, adjust differences in valuation on exchange or partition by giving or receiving considerations or dedicate easements to public use without consideration.

9. Enter for any purpose into a lease as lessor or lessee, with or without option to purchase or renew, for a term within or extending beyond the period of administration.

10. Enter into a lease or arrangement for exploration and removal of minerals or other natural resources or enter into a pooling or unitization agreement.

11. Abandon property when, in the opinion of the personal representative, it is valueless, is so encumbered, or is in condition that it is of no benefit to the estate.

12. Vote stocks or other securities in person or by general or limited proxy.

13. Pay calls, assessments and other sums chargeable or accruing against or on account of securities, unless barred by the provisions relating to claims.

14. Hold a security in the name of a nominee or in other form without disclosure of the interest of the estate but the personal representative is liable for any act of the nominee in connection with the security so held.

15. Insure the assets of the estate against damage, loss and liability and himself against liability as to third persons.

16. Borrow money with or without security to be repaid from the estate assets or otherwise, and advance money for the protection of the estate.

17. Effect a fair and reasonable compromise with any debtor or obligor, or extend, renew or in any manner modify the terms of any obligation owing to the estate. If the personal representative holds a mortgage, pledge or other lien upon property of another person, he may, in lieu of foreclosure, accept a conveyance or transfer of encumbered assets from the owner thereof in satisfaction of the indebtedness secured by lien.

18. Pay taxes, assessments, compensation of the personal representative and other expenses incident to the administration of the estate.

19. Sell or exercise stock subscription or conversion rights, and consent, directly or through a committee or other agent, to the reorganization, consolidation, merger, dissolution or liquidation of a corporation or other business enterprise.

20. Allocate items of income or expense to either estate income or principal, as permitted or provided by law.

21. Employ persons, including attorneys, auditors, investment advisors or agents, even if they are associated with the personal representative, to advise or assist the personal representative in the performance of his administrative duties, act without independent investigation upon their recommendations and instead of acting personally, employ one or more agents to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary.

22. Prosecute or defend claims, or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of the estate and of the personal representative in the performance of his duties.

23. Sell, mortgage or lease any real or personal property of the estate or any interest therein for cash or credit or for part cash and part credit, and with or without security for unpaid balances.

24. Continue any unincorporated business or venture in which the decedent was engaged at the time of his death:

(a) In the same business form for a period of not more than four months from the date of appointment of a general personal representative if continuation is a reasonable means of preserving the value of the business including goodwill.

(b) In the same business form for any additional period of time that may be approved by order of the court in a formal proceeding with notice to interested persons.

(c) Throughout the period of administration if the business is incorporated by the personal representative and if none of the probable distributees of the business who are competent adults object to its incorporation and retention in the estate.

25. Incorporate, or create a limited liability company to hold, any business or venture in which the decedent was engaged at the time of his death.

26. Provide for exoneration of the personal representative from personal liability in any contract entered into on behalf of the estate.

27. Satisfy and settle claims and distribute the estate as provided in this title.

 

#### Section 14-3716. Powers and duties of successor personal representative

A successor personal representative has the same power and duty as the original personal representative to complete the administration and distribution of the estate, as expeditiously as possible, but he shall not exercise any power expressly made personal to the executor named in the will.

#### Section 14-3717. Co-representatives; when joint action required

If two or more persons are appointed co-representatives and unless the will provides otherwise, the concurrence of all is required on all acts connected with the administration and distribution of the estate. This restriction does not apply when any co-representative receives and receipts for property due the estate, when the concurrence of all cannot readily be obtained in the time reasonably available for emergency action necessary to preserve the estate, or when a co-representative has been delegated to act for the others. Persons dealing with a co-representative if actually unaware that another has been appointed to serve with him or if advised by the personal representative with whom they deal that he has authority to act alone for any of the reasons mentioned herein, are as fully protected as if the person with whom they dealt had been the sole personal representative.

#### Section 14-3718. Powers of surviving personal representative

Unless the terms of the will otherwise provide, every power exercisable by personal co-representatives may be exercised by the one or more remaining after the appointment of one or more is terminated, and if one of two or more nominated as co-executors is not appointed, those appointed may exercise all the powers incident to the office.

#### Section 14-3719. Compensation of personal representative

A personal representative is entitled to reasonable compensation for his services. If a will provides for compensation of the personal representative and there is no contract with the decedent regarding compensation, he may renounce the provision before qualifying and be entitled to reasonable compensation. A personal representative also may renounce his right to all or any part of the compensation. A written renunciation of fee may be filed with the court.

#### Section 14-3720. Expenses in estate litigation

If any personal representative or person nominated as personal representative defends or prosecutes any proceeding in good faith, whether successful or not he is entitled to receive from the estate his necessary expenses and disbursements including reasonable attorneys' fees incurred.

#### Section 14-3721. Proceedings for review of employment of agents and compensation of personal representatives and employees of estate

After notice to all interested persons, on petition of an interested person, including any person employed by the personal representative, or on appropriate motion if administration is supervised, the court may review the propriety of employment of any person by the personal representative, the reasonableness of the compensation of any person so employed, or the reasonableness of the compensation determined by the personal representative for his own services. Any person who has received excessive compensation from an estate for services rendered may be ordered to make appropriate refund.

#### Section 14-3722. Compensation of appointees

A. If not otherwise compensated for services rendered, an investigator, accountant or lawyer appointed pursuant to this article is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate of the decedent. If the court compensates the provider of a service the court may charge the estate for the reasonable cost of the service and shall deposit these monies in the probate fund pursuant to section 14-5433.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, if compensation by the estate is not feasible the court shall determine and pay reasonable compensation for services rendered by an investigator, accountant or lawyer appointed in a probate administration proceeding.

C. If a county pays for any of these services from general fund appropriations, the county may charge the estate for reasonable compensation. The county treasurer shall deposit monies collected pursuant to this subsection in the same fund from which the expenditure was made.

 

### Article 8 - Creditors' Claims

#### Section 14-3801. Notice to creditors

A. Unless notice has already been given under this section, at the time of appointment a personal representative shall publish a notice to creditors once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county announcing the appointment and the personal representative's address and notifying creditors of the estate to present their claims within four months after the date of the first publication of the notice or be forever barred.

B. A personal representative shall give written notice by mail or other delivery to all known creditors, notifying the creditors of the personal representative's appointment. The notice shall also notify all known creditors to present the creditor's claim within four months after the published notice, if notice is given as provided in subsection A, or within sixty days after the mailing or other delivery of the notice, whichever is later, or be forever barred. A written notice shall be the notice described in subsection A or a similar notice.

C. The personal representative is not liable to a creditor or to a successor of the decedent for giving or failing to give notice under this section.

#### Section 14-3802. Statute of limitations

Unless an estate is insolvent the personal representative, with the consent of all successors whose interests would be affected, may waive any defense of limitations available to the estate. If the defense is not waived, no claim which was barred by any statute of limitations at the time of the decedent's death shall be allowed or paid. The running of any statute of limitations measured from some other event than death and advertisement for claims against a decedent is suspended during the four months following the decedent's death but resumes thereafter as to claims not barred pursuant to the sections which follow. For purposes of any statute of limitations, the proper presentation of a claim under section 14-3804 is equivalent to commencement of a proceeding on the claim.

#### Section 14-3803. Limitations on presentation of claims

A. All claims against a decedent's estate that arose before the death of the decedent, including claims of the state and any of its political subdivisions, whether due or to become due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, founded on contract, tort or other legal basis, if not barred earlier by any other statute of limitations or nonclaim statute, are barred against the estate, the personal representative and the heirs and devisees of the decedent, unless presented within the earlier of either:

1. Two years after the decedent's death plus the time remaining in the period commenced by an actual or published notice pursuant to section 14-3801, subsection A or B.

2. The time prescribed by section 14-3801, subsection B for creditors who are given actual notice and within the time prescribed in section 14-3801, subsection A for all creditors barred by publication.

B. A claim that is described in subsection A of this section and that is barred by the nonclaim statute of the decedent's domicile before the giving of notice to creditors in this state is barred in this state.

C. All claims against a decedent's estate that arise at or after the death of the decedent, including claims of the state and any political subdivision, whether due or to become due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, founded on contract, tort or other legal basis, are barred against the estate, the personal representative and the heirs and devisees of the decedent, unless presented as either of the following:

1. A claim based on a contract with the personal representative, within four months after performance by the personal representative is due.

2. Any other claim, within the later of four months after it arises or the time specified in subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section.

D. This section does not affect or prevent any of the following:

1. Any proceeding to enforce any mortgage, pledge or other lien upon property of the estate.

2. To the limits of the insurance protection only, any proceeding to establish liability of the decedent or the personal representative for which he is protected by liability insurance.

3. Collection of compensation for services rendered and reimbursement for expenses advanced by the personal representative or by the attorney or accountant for the personal representative or the estate.

#### Section 14-3804. Manner of presentation of claims

Claims against a decedent's estate may be presented as follows:

1. The claimant may deliver or mail to the personal representative a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant and the amount claimed. The claim is deemed presented on receipt of the written statement of claim by the personal representative. If a claim is not yet due, the date when it will become due shall be stated. If the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the nature of the uncertainty shall be stated. If the claim is secured, the security shall be described. Failure to describe correctly the security, the nature of any uncertainty, and the due date of a claim not yet due does not invalidate the presentation made.

2. The claimant may commence a proceeding against the personal representative in any court where the personal representative may be subjected to jurisdiction, to obtain payment of his claim against the estate, but the commencement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for presenting the claim. No presentation of claim is required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent which were pending at the time of his death.

3. If a claim is presented under paragraph 1, no proceeding thereon may be commenced more than sixty days after the personal representative has mailed a notice of disallowance; but, in the case of a claim which is not presently due or which is contingent or unliquidated, the personal representative may consent to an extension of the sixty day period, or to avoid injustice the court, on petition, may order an extension of the sixty day period, except no extension may run beyond the applicable statute of limitations.

#### Section 14-3805. Priority of claims

A. If the applicable assets of the estate are insufficient to pay all claims in full, the personal representative shall make payment in the following order:

1. Costs and expenses of administration.

2. Reasonable funeral expenses.

3. Debts and taxes with preference under federal law.

4. Reasonable and necessary medical and hospital expenses of the last illness of the decedent, including compensation of persons attending him.

5. Debts and taxes with preference under the laws of this state.

6. All other claims.

B. No preference shall be given in the payment of any claim over any other claim of the same class and a claim due and payable shall not be entitled to a preference over claims not due.

#### Section 14-3806. Allowance of claims

A. As to claims presented in the manner described in section 14-3804 within the time limit prescribed in section 14-3803, the personal representative may mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim has been disallowed. Every claim which is disallowed in whole or in part by the personal representative is barred so far as not allowed unless the claimant files a petition for allowance in the court or commences a proceeding against the personal representative not later than sixty days after the mailing of the notice of disallowance or partial allowance.  Failure of the personal representative to mail notice to a claimant of action on his claim for sixty days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired has the effect of a notice of allowance. The personal representative of the estate of a deceased spouse may classify a claim as a community claim payable out of community property, or as a separate claim payable out of separate property and the balance of the decedent's half of community property. Either classification constitutes a disallowance in part; failure to give notice of the classification to the claimant as provided in this subsection, or failure to classify an allowed claim, has the effect of allowing the claim as payable out of either separate or community property, whichever is more beneficial to the claimant.

B. The personal representative may at any time prior to payment, but not later than six months after presentation of the claim, rescind the allowance of a claim and notify the claimant of the change to a disallowance in whole or in part. The disallowed claim is then subject to bar as provided in subsection A. After allowance of a claim by a court order or judgment, or entry of an order directing payment of an allowed claim, the allowance may not be rescinded by the personal representative. After disallowing a claim, the personal representative may change the disallowance to an allowance prior to expiration of the time within which the claimant may file a petition for allowance or commence a proceeding on the claim under subsection A. After a disallowed claim is barred, it may be allowed and paid only if the estate is solvent and all successors whose interests would be affected consent.

C. Upon the petition of the personal representative or of a claimant in a proceeding for the purpose, the court may allow in whole or in part any claim or claims presented to the personal representative in due time and not barred by subsection A of this section. Notice in this proceeding shall be given to the claimant, the personal representative and those other persons interested in the estate as the court may direct by order entered at the time the proceeding is commenced.

D. A judgment in a proceeding in another court against a personal representative to enforce a claim against a decedent's estate is an allowance of the claim.

E. Unless otherwise provided in any judgment in another court entered against the personal representative, allowed claims bear interest at the legal rate for the period commencing sixty days after the time for original presentation of the claim has expired unless based on a contract making a provision for interest, in which case they bear interest in accordance with that provision.

#### Section 14-3807. Payment of claims

A. On the expiration of the earlier of the time limitations prescribed in section 14-3803 for the presentation of claims, the personal representative shall proceed to pay the claims allowed against the estate in the order of priority prescribed, after making provision for allowance in lieu of homestead, exempt property and family allowance, for claims already presented which have not yet been allowed or whose allowance has been appealed, and for unbarred claims which may yet be presented, including costs and expenses of administration. By petition to the court in a proceeding for the purpose, or by appropriate motion if the administration is supervised, a claimant whose claim has been allowed but not paid as provided in this section may secure an order directing the personal representative to pay the claim to the extent that funds of the estate are available for the payment.

B. The personal representative at any time may pay any just claim which has not been barred, with or without formal presentation, but the personal representative is personally liable to any other claimant whose claim is allowed and who is injured by such payment if either:

1. The payment was made before the expiration of the time limit stated in subsection A of this section and the personal representative failed to require the payee to give adequate security for the refund of any of the payment necessary to pay other claimants.

2. The payment was made, due to the negligence or wilful fault of the personal representative, in such manner as to deprive the injured claimant of the claimant's priority.

#### Section 14-3808. Individual liability of personal representative

A. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, a personal representative is not individually liable on a contract properly entered into in his fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the estate unless he fails to reveal his representative capacity and identify the estate in the contract.

B. A personal representative is individually liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate or for torts committed in the course of administration of the estate only if he is personally at fault.

C. Claims based on contracts entered into by a personal representative in his fiduciary capacity, on obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate, or on torts committed in the course of estate administration may be asserted against the estate by proceeding against the personal representative in his fiduciary capacity, whether or not the personal representative is individually liable therefor.

D. Issues of liability as between the estate and the personal representative individually may be determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge or indemnification or other appropriate proceeding.

#### Section 14-3809. Secured claims

Payment of a secured claim is upon the basis of the amount allowed if the creditor surrenders his security, otherwise payment is upon the basis of one of the following:

1. If the creditor exhausts his security before receiving payment, unless precluded by other law, upon the amount of the claim allowed less the fair value of the security.

2. If the creditor does not have the right to exhaust his security or has not done so, upon the amount of the claim allowed less the value of the security determined by converting it into money according to the terms of the agreement pursuant to which the security was delivered to the creditor, or by the creditor and personal representative by agreement, arbitration, compromise or litigation.

#### Section 14-3810. Claims not due and contingent or unliquidated claims

A. If a claim which will become due at a future time or a contingent or unliquidated claim becomes due or certain before the distribution of the estate, and if the claim has been allowed or established by a proceeding, it is paid in the same manner as presently due and absolute claims of the same class.

B. In other cases the personal representative or, on petition of the personal representative or the claimant in a special proceeding for the purpose, the court may provide for payment as follows:

1. If the claimant consents, he may be paid the present or agreed value of the claim, taking any uncertainty into account.

2. Arrangement for future payment, or possible payment, on the happening of the contingency or on liquidation may be made by creating a trust, giving a mortgage, obtaining a bond or security from a distributee, or otherwise.

#### Section 14-3811. Counterclaims

In allowing a claim the personal representative may deduct any counterclaim which the estate has against the claimant. In determining a claim against an estate a court shall reduce the amount allowed by the amount of any counterclaims and, if the counterclaims exceed the claim, render a judgment against the claimant in the amount of the excess. A counterclaim, liquidated or unliquidated, may arise from a transaction other than that upon which the claim is based. A counterclaim may give rise to relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the claim.

#### Section 14-3812. Execution and levies prohibited

No execution may issue upon nor may any levy be made against any property of the estate under any judgment against a decedent or a personal representative, but this section shall not be construed to prevent the enforcement of mortgages, pledges or liens upon real or personal property in an appropriate proceeding.

#### Section 14-3813. Compromise of claims

When a claim against the estate has been presented in any manner, the personal representative may, if it appears for the best interest of the estate, compromise the claim, whether due or not due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated.

#### Section 14-3814. Encumbered assets

If any assets of the estate are encumbered by mortgage, pledge, lien or other security interest, the personal representative may pay the encumbrance or any part thereof, renew or extend any obligation secured by the encumbrance or convey or transfer the assets to the creditor in satisfaction of his lien, in whole or in part, whether or not the holder of the encumbrance has presented a claim, if it appears to be for the best interest of the estate. Payment of an encumbrance does not increase the share of the distributee entitled to the encumbered assets unless the distributee is entitled to exoneration.

#### Section 14-3815. Administration in more than one state; duty of personal representative

A. All assets of estates being administered in this state are subject to all claims, allowances and charges existing or established against the personal representative wherever appointed.

B. If the estate either in this state or as a whole is insufficient to cover all family exemptions and allowances determined by the law of the decedent's domicile, prior charges and claims, after satisfaction of the exemptions, allowances and charges, each claimant whose claim has been allowed either in this state or in another jurisdiction in administrations of which the personal representative is aware, is entitled to receive payment of an equal proportion of his claim. If a preference or security in regard to a claim is allowed in another jurisdiction but not in this state, the creditor so benefited is to receive dividends from local assets only upon the balance of his claim after deducting the amount of the benefit.

C. In case the family exemptions and allowances, prior charges and claims of the entire estate exceed the total value of the portions of the estate being administered separately and this state is not the state of the decedent's last domicile, the claims allowed in this state shall be paid their proportion if local assets are adequate for the purpose, and the balance of local assets shall be transferred to the domiciliary personal representative. If local assets are not sufficient to pay all claims allowed in this state the amount to which they are entitled, local assets shall be marshalled so that each claim allowed in this state is paid its proportion as far as possible, after taking into account all dividends on claims allowed in this state from assets in other jurisdictions.

#### Section 14-3816. Final distribution to domiciliary representative

The estate of a nonresident decedent being administered by a personal representative appointed in this state shall, if there is a personal representative of the decedent's domicile willing to receive it, be distributed to the domiciliary personal representative for the benefit of the successors of the decedent unless any of the following apply:

1. By virtue of the decedent's will, if any, and applicable choice of law rules, the successors are identified pursuant to the local law of this state without reference to the local law of the decedent's domicile.

2. The personal representative of this state, after reasonable inquiry, is unaware of the existence or identity of a domiciliary personal representative.

3. The court orders otherwise in a proceeding for a closing order under section 14-3931 or incident to the closing of a supervised administration. In other cases, distribution of the estate of a decedent shall be made in accordance with the other articles of this chapter.

### Article 9 - Special Provisions Relating to Distribution

#### Section 14-3901. Successors' rights if no administration

In the absence of administration, the heirs and devisees are entitled to the estate in accordance with the terms of a probated will or the laws of intestate succession. Devisees may establish title by the probated will to devised property. Persons entitled to property by allowance in lieu of homestead, exemption or intestacy may establish title thereto by proof of the decedent's ownership, his death and their relationship to the decedent. Successors take subject to all charges incident to administration, including the claims of creditors and allowances of surviving spouse and dependent children, and subject to the rights of others resulting from abatement, retainer, advancement and ademption.

#### Section 14-3902. Distribution; order in which assets appropriated; abatement

A. Except as provided in subsection B, shares of distributees abate, without any preference or priority as between real and personal property, in the following order:

1. Property not disposed of by the will.

2. Residuary devises.

3. General devises.

4. Specific devises.

For purposes of abatement, a general devise charged on any specific property or fund is a specific devise to the extent of the value of the property on which it is charged, and upon the failure or insufficiency of the property on which it is charged, a general devise to the extent of the failure or insufficiency. Abatement within each classification is in proportion to the amounts of property each of the beneficiaries would have received if full distribution of the property had been made in accordance with the terms of the will.

B. If the will expresses an order of abatement, or if the testamentary plan or the express or implied purpose of the devise would be defeated by the order of abatement stated in subsection A, the shares of the distributees abate as may be found necessary to give effect to the intention of the testator.

C. If an estate of a decedent consists partly of separate property and partly of community property:

1. Community debts shall be charged against community property.

2. Separate debts shall be charged against separate property and against the balance of decedent's half of community property.

3. Expenses of administration shall be charged against separate property and decedent's half of community property in proportion to the relative value thereof, but any special expenses attributable to management of community property may be charged against the entire community property.

D. If the subject of a preferred devise is sold or used incident to administration, abatement shall be achieved by appropriate adjustments in, or contribution from, other interests in the remaining assets.

#### Section 14-3903. Right of retainer

The amount of a noncontingent indebtedness of a successor to the estate if due, or its present value if not due, shall be offset against the successor's interest, but the successor has the benefit of any defense which would be available to him in a direct proceeding for recovery of the debt.

#### Section 14-3904. Interest on general pecuniary devise

Unless a contrary intention is indicated by the will, general pecuniary devises bear interest at the legal rate beginning one year after the first appointment of a personal representative until payment.

#### Section 14-3906. Distribution in kind; valuation; method

A. Unless a contrary intention is indicated by the will, the distributable assets of a decedent's estate shall be distributed in kind to the extent possible through application of the following provisions:

1. A specific devisee is entitled to distribution of the thing devised to him, and a spouse or child who has selected particular assets of an estate as provided in section 14-2403 shall receive the items selected.

2. Any allowance in lieu of homestead or family allowance or devise of a stated sum of money may be satisfied by value in kind if the following are true:

(a) The person entitled to the payment has not demanded payment in cash.

(b) The property distributed in kind is valued at fair market value as of the date of its distribution.

(c) A residuary devisee has not requested that the asset in question remain a part of the residue of the estate.

3. For the purpose of valuation under paragraph 2 securities regularly traded on recognized exchanges, if distributed in kind, are valued at the price for the last sale of like securities traded on the business day prior to distribution, or if there was no sale on that day, at the median between amounts bid and offered at the close of that day. Assets consisting of sums owed the decedent or the estate by solvent debtors as to which there is no known dispute or defense are valued at the sum due with accrued interest or discounted to the date of distribution. For assets which do not have readily ascertainable values, a valuation as of a date not more than thirty days prior to the date of distribution, if otherwise reasonable, controls. For purposes of facilitating distribution, the personal representative may ascertain the value of the assets as of the time of the proposed distribution in any reasonable way, including the employment of qualified appraisers, even if the assets may have been previously appraised.

4. The residuary estate shall be distributed in kind if there is no objection to the proposed distribution and it is practicable to distribute undivided interests. In other cases, residuary property may be converted into cash for distribution.

B. After the probable charges against the estate are known, the personal representative may mail or deliver a proposal for distribution to all persons who have a right to object to the proposed distribution. The right of any distributee to object to the proposed distribution on the basis of the kind or value of asset the person is to receive, if not waived earlier in writing, terminates if the person fails to object in writing received by the personal representative within thirty days after mailing or delivery of the proposal.

#### Section 14-3907. Distribution in kind; evidence

A. If distribution in kind is made, the personal representative shall execute an instrument or deed of distribution assigning, transferring or releasing the assets to the distributee as evidence of the distributee's title to the property.

B. The names and addresses of each distributee shall be included in any instrument of distribution transferring title to real property recorded by any county recorder.

#### Section 14-3908. Distribution; right or title of distributee

Proof that a distributee has received an instrument or deed of distribution of assets in kind, or payment in distribution from a personal representative, is conclusive evidence that the distributee has succeeded to the interest of the estate in the distributed assets, as against all persons interested in the estate, except that the personal representative may recover under section 14-3909 the assets or their value if the distribution was improper.

#### Section 14-3909. Improper distribution; liability of distributee

Unless the distribution or payment no longer can be questioned because of adjudication, estoppel or limitation, a distributee of property or money improperly distributed or paid, or a claimant who was improperly paid, is liable to return the property improperly received and its income since distribution if he has the property. If such a distributee does not have the property, he is liable to return the value as of the date of disposition of the property improperly received and its income and gain received by him.

#### Section 14-3910. Purchasers from distributees or transferees protected

If property distributed in kind or a security interest therein is acquired for value by a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who has received an instrument or deed of distribution from the personal representative, or is so acquired by a purchaser from or lender to a transferee from such distributee, the purchaser or lender takes title free of rights of any person interested in the estate and incurs no personal liability to the estate, whether or not the distribution was proper or supported by court order and whether or not the authority of the personal representative was terminated prior to execution of the instrument or deed. This section protects a purchaser from or lender to a distributee who as personal representative has executed a deed of distribution to himself, as well as from any other distributee or his transferee. To be protected under this provision, a purchaser or lender need not inquire whether a personal representative acted properly in making the distribution in kind, even if the personal representative and the distributee are the same person, or whether the authority of the personal representative had terminated prior to the distribution.

#### Section 14-3911. Partition for purpose of distribution

When two or more heirs or devisees are entitled to distribution of undivided interests in any real or personal property of the estate, the personal representative or one or more of the heirs or devisees may petition the court prior to the formal or informal closing of the estate, to make partition. After notice to the interested heirs or devisees, the court shall partition the property in the same manner as provided by the law for civil actions of partition. The court may direct the personal representative to sell any property which cannot be partitioned without prejudice to the owners and which cannot conveniently be allotted to any one party.

#### Section 14-3912. Private agreements among successors to decedent binding on personal representative

Subject to the rights of creditors and taxing authorities, competent successors may agree among themselves to alter the interests, shares, or amounts to which they are entitled under the will of the decedent or under the laws of intestacy, in any way that they provide in a written contract executed by all who are affected by its provisions. The personal representative shall abide by the terms of the agreement subject to his obligation to administer the estate for the benefit of creditors, to pay all taxes and expenses of administration, and to carry out the responsibilities of his office for the benefit of any successors of the decedent who are not parties. Personal representatives of decedents' estates are not required to see to the performance of trusts if the trustee thereof is another person who is willing to accept the trust. Accordingly, trustees of a testamentary trust are successors for the purposes of this section. This section does not relieve trustees of any duties owed to beneficiaries of trusts.

#### Section 14-3913. Distributions to trustee

A. Before distributing to a trustee, the personal representative may require that the trustee inform the beneficiaries as provided in section 14-10813, subsection B, paragraph 3, and if the state in which it is to be administered provides for registration, that the trust be registered.

B. If the trust instrument does not excuse the trustee from giving bond, the personal representative may petition the appropriate court to require that the trustee post bond if the personal representative apprehends that distribution might jeopardize the interests of persons who are not able to protect themselves, and the personal representative may withhold distribution until the court has acted.

C. An inference of negligence on the part of the personal representative shall not be drawn from the personal representative's failure to exercise the authority conferred by subsections A and B of this section.

 

#### Section 14-3914. Disposition of unclaimed assets

A. If an heir, devisee or claimant cannot be found, the personal representative shall distribute the share of the missing person to his conservator, if any, otherwise in cash to the department of revenue for deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the permanent school fund.

B. If a person later appears and claims as the missing person, he shall proceed in the same manner as an heir, devisee or legatee claiming escheated property under sections 12-886 and 12-887.

 

#### Section 14-3915. Distribution to person under disability

A personal representative may discharge his obligation to distribute to any person under legal disability by distributing to his conservator, or any other person authorized by this title or otherwise to give a valid receipt and discharge for the distribution.

#### Section 14-3916. Community property

In making a division or distribution of community property held in the decedent's estate, the personal representative may consider community property held outside the estate so that the division of community property held in the estate and outside the estate is based on equal value but is not necessarily proportionate.

 

### Article 10 - Closing Estates

#### Section 14-3931. Formal proceedings terminating administration; testate or intestate; order of general protection

A. A personal representative or any interested person may petition for an order of complete settlement of the estate. The personal representative may petition at any time, and any other interested person may petition after one year from the appointment of the original personal representative except that no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims which arose prior to the death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to determine testacy, if not previously determined, to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe any will or determine heirs and adjudicate the final settlement and distribution of the estate. Notice must be given to all interested persons, and a copy of the final account must also be sent to the distributees whose interests are affected thereby. After hearing the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing, approving or decreeing distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of any interested person.

B. If one or more heirs or devisees were omitted as parties in, or were not given notice of, a previous formal testacy proceeding, the court, on proper petition for an order of complete settlement of the estate under this section, and after notice to the omitted or unnotified persons and other interested parties determined to be interested on the assumption that the previous order concerning testacy is conclusive as to those given notice of the earlier proceeding, may determine testacy as it affects the omitted persons and confirm or alter the previous order of testacy as it affects all interested persons as appropriate in the light of the new proofs. In the absence of objection by an omitted or unnotified person, evidence received in the original testacy proceeding shall constitute prima facie proof of due execution of any will previously admitted to probate, or of the fact that the decedent left no valid will if the prior proceedings determined this fact.

#### Section 14-3932. Formal proceedings terminating testate administration; order construing will without adjudicating testacy

A personal representative administering an estate under an informally probated will or any devisee under an informally probated will may petition for an order of settlement of the estate which will not adjudicate the testacy status of the decedent. The personal representative may petition at any time, and a devisee may petition after one year from the appointment of the original personal representative, except that no petition under this section may be entertained until the time for presenting claims which arose prior to the death of the decedent has expired. The petition may request the court to consider the final account or compel or approve an accounting and distribution, to construe the will and adjudicate final settlement and distribution of the estate. After notice to all devisees and the personal representative and hearing, the court may enter an order or orders, on appropriate conditions, determining the persons entitled to distribution of the estate under the will, and, as circumstances require, approving settlement and directing, approving or decreeing distribution of the estate and discharging the personal representative from further claim or demand of any devisee who is a party to the proceeding and those he represents. If it appears that a part of the estate is intestate, the proceedings shall be dismissed or amendments made to meet the provisions of section 14-3931.

#### Section 14-3933. Closing estates; statement of personal representative

A. Unless prohibited by order of the court and except for estates being administered in supervised administration proceedings, a personal representative may close an estate by filing with the court no earlier than four months after the date of original appointment of a general personal representative for the estate a verified statement stating that the personal representative, or a previous personal representative has:

1. Determined that the time limit for presentation of creditors' claims has expired.

2. Fully administered the estate of the decedent by making payment, settlement or other disposition of all claims that were presented, expenses of administration and estate, inheritance and other death taxes, except as specified in the statement, and that the assets of the estate have been distributed to the persons entitled. If any claims remain undischarged, the statement shall state whether the personal representative has distributed the estate subject to possible liability with the agreement of the distributees or it shall state in detail other arrangements that have been made to accommodate outstanding liabilities.

3. Sent a copy of the statement to all distributees of the estate and to all creditors or other claimants of whom the personal representative is aware whose claims are neither paid nor barred and has furnished a full account in writing of the personal representative's administration to the distributees whose interests are affected thereby.

B. If no proceedings involving the personal representative are pending in the court one year after the closing statement is filed, the appointment of the personal representative terminates.

#### Section 14-3934. Liability of distributees to claimants

After assets of an estate have been distributed and subject to section 14-3936, an undischarged claim not barred may be prosecuted in a proceeding against one or more distributees. No distributee shall be liable to claimants for amounts received as exempt property, allowance in lieu of homestead or family allowance, or for amounts in excess of the value of his distribution as of the time of distribution. As between distributees, each shall bear the cost of satisfaction of unbarred claims as if the claim had been satisfied in the course of administration. Any distributee who shall have failed to notify other distributees of the demand made upon him by the claimant in sufficient time to permit them to join in any proceeding in which the claim was asserted against him loses his right of contribution against other distributees.

#### Section 14-3935. Limitations on proceedings against personal representative

Unless previously barred by adjudication and except as provided in the closing statement, the rights of successors and of creditors whose claims against the personal representative for breach of fiduciary duty have not otherwise been barred are barred unless a proceeding to assert the same is commenced within six months after the filing of the closing statement. The rights thus barred do not include rights to recover from a personal representative for fraud, misrepresentation or inadequate disclosure related to the settlement of the decedent's estate.

#### Section 14-3936. Limitations on actions and proceedings against distributees

A. Unless previously adjudicated in a formal testacy proceeding or in a proceeding settling the accounts of a personal representative or otherwise barred, the claim of a claimant, other than a creditor of the decedent, to recover from a distributee who is liable to pay the claim, and the right of an heir or devisee or of a successor personal representative acting in an heir's or devisee's behalf, to recover property improperly distributed or its value from any distributee is forever barred at the later of three years after the decedent's death or one year after the time of distribution.

B. All claims of the decedent's creditors against distributees are barred after the limitations period for the presentation of claims of the decedent's creditors pursuant to section 14-3803.

C. This section does not bar an action to recover property or value received as the result of fraud.

#### Section 14-3937. Certificate discharging liens securing fiduciary performance

After his appointment has terminated, the personal representative, his sureties or any successor of either, upon the filing of a verified application showing, so far as is known by the applicant, that no action concerning the estate is pending in any court, is entitled to receive a certificate from the registrar that the personal representative appears to have fully administered the estate in question. The certificate evidences discharge of any lien on any property given to secure the obligation of the personal representative in lieu of bond or any surety, but does not preclude action against the personal representative or the surety.

#### Section 14-3938. Subsequent administration

If other property of the estate is discovered after an estate has been settled and the personal representative has been discharged or after one year after a closing statement has been filed, the registrar, if the original application was or could have been brought under article 3 of this chapter, or the court, if the original petition was required to have been brought under article 4 or 5 of this chapter, on the application or petition of any interested person and on notice as provided in this chapter, may appoint the same or a successor personal representative to administer the subsequently discovered estate. If a new appointment is made, unless the court orders otherwise, the provisions of this title apply as appropriate, but a claim previously barred may not be asserted in the subsequent administration.

### Article 11 - Compromise of Controversies

#### Section 14-3951. Effect of approval of agreements involving trusts, inalienable interests, or interests of third persons

A compromise of any controversy as to admission to probate of any instrument offered for formal probate as the will of a decedent, the construction, validity or effect of any probated will, the rights or interests in the estate of the decedent, of any successor, or the administration of the estate, if approved in a formal proceeding in the court for that purpose, is binding on all the parties thereto including those unborn, unascertained or who could not be located. An approved compromise is binding even though it may affect a trust or an inalienable interest. A compromise does not impair the rights of creditors or of taxing authorities who are not parties to it.

#### Section 14-3952. Procedure for securing court approval of compromise

The procedure for securing court approval of a compromise is as follows:

1. The terms of the compromise shall be set forth in an agreement in writing which shall be executed by all competent persons and parents acting for any minor child having beneficial interests or having claims which will or may be affected by the compromise. Execution is not required by any person whose identity cannot be ascertained or whose whereabouts is unknown and cannot reasonably be ascertained.

2. Any interested person, including the personal representative or a trustee, then may submit the agreement to the court for its approval and for execution by the personal representative, the trustee of every affected testamentary trust and other fiduciaries and representatives.

3. After notice to all interested persons or their representatives, including the personal representative of the estate and all affected trustees of trusts, the court, if it finds that the contest or controversy is in good faith and that the effect of the agreement upon the interests of persons represented by fiduciaries or other representatives is just and reasonable, shall make an order approving the agreement and directing all fiduciaries under its supervision to execute the agreement. Minor children represented only by their parents may be bound only if their parents join with other competent persons in execution of the compromise.  Upon the making of the order and the execution of the agreement, all further disposition of the estate is in accordance with the terms of the agreement.

### Article 12 - Transfer of Title to Small Estates by Affidavit and Summary Administration Procedure

#### Section 14-3971. Collection of personal property by affidavit; ownership of vehicles; affidavit of succession to real property

A. At any time after the death of a decedent, any employer owing wages, salary or other compensation for personal services of the decedent shall pay to the surviving spouse of the decedent the amount owing, not in excess of $5,000, on being presented an affidavit made by or on behalf of the spouse stating that the affiant is the surviving spouse of the decedent, or is authorized to act on behalf of the spouse, and that no application or petition for the appointment of a personal representative is pending or has been granted in this state or, if granted, the personal representative has been discharged or more than one year has elapsed since a closing statement has been filed.

The value of the decedent's interest in that real property shall be determined from the full cash value of the property as shown on the assessment rolls for the year in which the decedent died, except that in the case of a debt secured by a lien on real property the value shall be determined by the unpaid principal balance due on the debt as of the date of death.

#### Section 14-3973. Small estates; summary administrative procedure

If it appears from the inventory and appraisal that the value of the entire estate, less liens and encumbrances, does not exceed allowance in lieu of homestead, exempt property, family allowance, costs and expenses of administration, reasonable funeral expenses, and reasonable and necessary medical and hospital expenses of the last illness of the decedent, the personal representative, without giving notice to creditors, may immediately disburse and distribute the estate to the persons entitled thereto and file a closing statement as provided in section 14-3974.

#### Section 14-3974. Small estates; closing by sworn statement of personal representative

A. Unless prohibited by order of the court and except for estates being administered by supervised personal representatives, a personal representative may close an estate administered under the summary procedures of section 14-3973 by filing with the court, at any time after disbursement and distribution of the estate, a verified statement stating that:

## Chapter 4 - FOREIGN PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVES; ANCILLARY ADMINISTRATION

### Article 1 - Definitions

#### Section 14-4101. Definitions

In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Local administration" means administration by a personal representative appointed in this state pursuant to appointment proceedings described in chapter 3.

2. "Local personal representative" includes any personal representative appointed in this state pursuant to appointment proceedings described in chapter 3 and excludes foreign personal representatives who acquire the power of a local personal representative pursuant to section 14-4205.

3. "Resident creditor" means a person domiciled in, or doing business in this state, who is, or could be, a claimant against an estate of a nonresident decedent.

### Article 2 - Powers of Foreign Personal Representatives

#### Section 14-4201. Payment of debt and delivery of property to domiciliary foreign personal representative without local administration

At any time after the expiration of sixty days from the death of a nonresident decedent, any person indebted to the estate of the nonresident decedent or having possession or control of personal property, or of an instrument evidencing a debt, obligation, stock or chose in action belonging to the estate of the nonresident decedent may pay the debt, deliver the personal property, or the instrument evidencing the debt, obligation, stock or chose in action, to the domiciliary foreign personal representative of the nonresident decedent upon being presented with proof of his appointment and an affidavit made by or on behalf of the representative stating:

1. The date of the death of the nonresident decedent.

2. That no local administration, or application or petition therefor, is pending in this state.

3. That the domiciliary foreign personal representative is entitled to payment or delivery.

The provisions of this section are in addition to, and are not exclusive of, any other provision of law permitting payment of an obligation or delivery of property to a domiciliary foreign personal representative.

#### Section 14-4202. Payment or delivery discharges

Payment or delivery made in good faith on the basis of the proof of authority and affidavit releases the debtor or person having possession of the personal property to the same extent as if payment or delivery had been made to a local personal representative.

#### Section 14-4203. Resident creditor notice

Payment or delivery under section 14-4201 may not be made if a resident creditor of the nonresident decedent has notified the debtor of the nonresident decedent or the person having possession of the personal property belonging to the nonresident decedent that the debt should not be paid nor the property delivered to the domiciliary foreign personal representative.

#### Section 14-4204. Proof of authority and bond

If local administration, application or petition is not pending in this state, a domiciliary foreign personal representative may file with a court in this state in a county in which property belonging to the decedent is located certified copies of the appointment and of any official bond that has been given.

#### Section 14-4205. Powers

A domiciliary foreign personal representative who has complied with section 14-4204 may exercise as to assets in this state all powers of a local personal representative and may maintain actions and proceedings in this state subject to any conditions imposed upon nonresident parties generally.

#### Section 14-4206. Power of representatives in transition

The power of a domiciliary foreign personal representative under section 14-4201 or section 14-4205 shall be exercised only if there is no administration or application therefor pending in this state. An application or petition for local administration of the estate terminates the power of the foreign personal representative to act under section 14-4205, but the local court may allow the foreign personal representative to exercise limited powers to preserve the estate. No person who, before receiving actual notice of a pending local administration, has changed his position in reliance upon the powers of a foreign personal representative shall be prejudiced by reason of the application or petition for, or grant of, local administration. The local personal representative is subject to all duties and obligations which have accrued by virtue of the exercise of the powers by the foreign personal representative and may be substituted for him in any action or proceedings in this state.

#### Section 14-4207. Ancillary and other local administrations; provisions governing

### Article 2 - Guardians of Minors

#### Section 14-5201. Status of guardian of minor; general

A person becomes a guardian of a minor by acceptance of a testamentary appointment or upon appointment by the court. The guardianship status continues until terminated, without regard to the location from time to time of the guardian and minor ward.

#### Section 14-5202. Testamentary appointment of guardian of minor

The parent of a minor may appoint by will a guardian of an unmarried minor. Subject to the right of the minor under section 14-5203, a testamentary appointment becomes effective upon filing the guardian's acceptance in the court in which the will is probated, if before acceptance, both parents are dead or the surviving parent is adjudged incapacitated. If both parents are dead, an effective appointment by the parent who died later has priority. This state recognizes a testamentary appointment effected by filing the guardian's acceptance under a will probated in another state which is the testator's domicile. Upon acceptance of appointment, written notice of acceptance must be given by the guardian to the minor and also to either the person having his care or his nearest adult relation.

#### Section 14-5203. Objection by minor of fourteen or older to testamentary appointment

A minor of fourteen or more years may prevent an appointment of his testamentary guardian from becoming effective, or may cause a previously accepted appointment to terminate, by filing with the court in which the will is probated a written objection to the appointment before it is accepted or within thirty days after notice of its acceptance. An objection may be withdrawn. An objection does not preclude appointment by the court in a proper proceeding of the testamentary nominee or any other suitable person.

#### Section 14-5204. Court appointment of guardian of minor; conditions for appointment

The court may appoint a guardian for an unmarried minor if all parental rights of custody have been terminated or suspended by circumstances or prior court order. A guardian appointed by will as provided in section 14-5202 whose appointment has not been prevented or nullified under section 14-5203 has priority over any guardian who may be appointed by the court but the court may proceed with an appointment upon a finding that the testamentary guardian has failed to accept the testamentary appointment within thirty days after notice of the guardianship proceeding.

#### Section 14-5205. Court appointment of guardian of minor; venue

The venue for guardianship proceedings for a minor is in the place where the minor resides or is present.

#### Section 14-5206. Court appointment of guardian of minor; qualifications; priority of minor's nominee; fingerprints

A. The court shall appoint as guardian a person whose appointment would be in the best interests of the minor. The court may appoint a person nominated by the minor, if the minor is fourteen years of age or older, unless the court finds the appointment contrary to the best interests of the minor.

B. Before the court may appoint as guardian a person unrelated to the minor, the court shall, in order to determine the applicant's suitability as a guardian, require the potential guardian to furnish a full set of fingerprints to the court to enable a criminal background investigation to be conducted. The court shall submit the completed fingerprint card with the fee prescribed in section 41-1750 to the department of public safety. The applicant shall bear the cost of obtaining the criminal background information. The cost shall not exceed the actual cost of obtaining the applicant's criminal background information. The department of public safety shall conduct criminal history records checks pursuant to section 41-1750 and applicable federal law. The department of public safety is authorized to submit fingerprint card information to the federal bureau of investigation for a national criminal history records check.

#### Section 14-5207. Formal appointment of guardian of minor; procedure

A. Any person interested in the welfare of a minor may petition the court for appointment of a guardian. The court shall then set a hearing date. The petitioner shall give notice of the time and place of the hearing in the manner prescribed by section 14-1401 to:

1. A minor who is at least fourteen years of age.

2. The person who has had the principal care and custody of the minor during the sixty days preceding the date of the petition.

3. Any living parent of the minor.

B. Upon hearing, if the court finds that a qualified person seeks appointment, venue is proper, the required notices have been given, the requirements of section 14-5204 have been met and the welfare and best interests of the minor will be served by the requested appointment, it shall make the appointment and issue letters on the acceptance of the proposed guardian. In other cases the court may dismiss the proceedings or make any other disposition of the matter that will best serve the interests of the minor.

C. If necessary, the court may appoint a temporary guardian, with the status of an ordinary guardian of a minor, but the authority of a temporary guardian shall not last longer than six months.

D. If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the interests of the minor are or may be inadequately represented, it may appoint an attorney to represent the minor, giving consideration to the preference of the minor if the minor is at least fourteen years of age.

#### Section 14-5208. Consent to service by acceptance of appointment; notice

By accepting a testamentary or court appointment as guardian a guardian submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the guardianship that may be instituted by any interested person. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the guardian, or mailed to him by ordinary mail at his address as listed in the court records and to his address as then known to the petitioner. Letters of guardianship must indicate whether the guardian was appointed by will or by court order.

#### Section 14-5209. Powers and duties of guardian of minor

A. A guardian of a minor has the powers and responsibilities of a custodial parent regarding the ward’s support, care and education. A guardian is not personally liable for the ward’s expenses and is not liable to third persons by reason of the relationship for acts of the ward.

5. Report the condition of the ward and of the ward's estate which has been subject to his possession or control, as ordered by the court on petition of any person interested in the ward’s welfare or as required by court rule.

C. A guardian may:

4. Facilitate the ward's education, social or other activities and consent to medical or other professional care, treatment or advice for the ward. A guardian is not liable by reason of this consent for injury to the ward resulting from the negligence or acts of third persons unless a parent would have been liable in the circumstances.

5. Consent to the marriage or adoption of the ward.

6. If reasonable, delegate to the ward certain responsibilities for decisions affecting the ward’s well-being.

D. A guardian is entitled to reasonable compensation for services as guardian and to reimbursement for room, board and clothing personally provided to the ward, but only as approved by order of the court. If a conservator, other than the guardian or one who is affiliated with the guardian, has been appointed for the estate of the ward, reasonable compensation and reimbursement to the guardian may be approved and paid by the conservator without order of the court.

E. In the interest of developing self-reliance on the part of a ward or for other good cause, the court, at the time of appointment or later, on its own motion or on appropriate petition or motion of the minor or other interested person may:

1. Create a limited guardianship by limiting the powers of a guardian otherwise conferred by this section. Any limitation on the statutory power of a guardian of a minor must be endorsed on the guardian’s letters.

2. Remove a limitation and issue revised letters.

#### Section 14-5210. Termination of appointment of guardian; general

A guardian's authority and responsibility terminates on the death, resignation or removal of the guardian or on the minor's death, adoption, marriage or attainment of majority. Termination does not affect the guardian’s liability for prior acts or the guardian’s obligation to account for the ward’s monies and assets. Resignation of a guardian does not terminate the guardianship until it has been approved by the court.

#### Section 14-5211. Proceedings subsequent to appointment; venue

A. The court where the ward resides has concurrent jurisdiction with the court which appointed the guardian, or in which acceptance of a testamentary appointment was filed, over resignation, removal, accounting and other proceedings relating to the guardianship.

B. If the court located where the ward resides is not the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed, the court in which proceedings subsequent to appointment are commenced shall in all appropriate cases notify the other court, in this or another state, and after consultation with that court determine whether to retain jurisdiction or transfer the proceedings to the other court, whichever is in the best interests of the ward. A copy of any order accepting a resignation or removing a guardian shall be sent to the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed.

#### Section 14-5212. Resignation or removal proceedings

A. Any person interested in the welfare of a ward or the ward, if fourteen or more years of age, may petition for removal of a guardian on the ground that removal would be in the best interests of the ward, or for any other order that is in the best interest of the ward. A guardian may petition for permission to resign. A petition for removal or for permission to resign may, but need not, include a request for appointment of a successor guardian.

B. Notice of a hearing on a petition for an order subsequent to appointment shall be given to a ward who is at least fourteen years of age, the guardian and any other person the court orders to receive the notice.

D. If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the interests of the ward are, or may be, inadequately represented, it may appoint an attorney to represent the minor, giving consideration to the preference of the minor if the minor is fourteen or more years of age.

#### Section 14-5213. Prospective guardian's blindness; burden of proof; specific written findings; definitions

A. A court may not refuse to appoint an individual as guardian of a minor based on the individual's blindness if the appointment is determined to be otherwise in the best interests of the minor.

B. If an individual's blindness is alleged to have a detrimental impact on a minor, the party who raises the allegation has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the individual's behavior endangers or is likely to endanger the health, safety or welfare of the minor.

D. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Blindness" means having either of the following:

(a) A central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens.

B. An individual, by will or other signed writing, may appoint a guardian for the individual's spouse who the appointing spouse believes is an incapacitated person, specify desired limitations on the powers to be given to the guardian and revoke or amend the appointment before confirmation by the court.

The objection does not preclude judicial appointment of the person selected by the appointing parent or spouse.  Notice of the objection must be given to the guardian and any other person entitled to notice of the acceptance of the appointment.  The court may treat the filing of an objection as a petition for the appointment of a temporary guardian pursuant to section 14-5310 or for the appointment of a limited or general guardian pursuant to section 14-5303 and proceed accordingly.

D. On petition of the appointing parent or spouse and a finding that the appointing parent or spouse will likely become unable to care for the incapacitated person within two years, before the appointment becomes effective, the court may confirm the appointing parent's or spouse's selection of a guardian and terminate the rights of others to object.  Notice must be given to the guardian and any other person entitled to notice of the acceptance of the appointment.

2. Give written notice of the acceptance of appointment to the appointing parent or spouse, if living, the incapacitated person, a person having care or custody of the incapacitated person other than the appointing parent or spouse, and the adult nearest in kinship.  Unless the appointment was previously confirmed by the court, the notice given pursuant to this paragraph must include a statement of the right of those notified to terminate the appointment by filing a written objection as provided in section 14-5301.

A party that is interested in the welfare of a minor who is at least seventeen years six months of age and who is alleged to be in need of protection may petition the court for appointment of a conservator or request an appropriate protective order pursuant to section 14-5404 and request that any conservatorship order or protective order take effect immediately on the minor's eighteenth birthday.

 

#### Section 14-5302. Venue

The venue for guardianship proceedings for an incapacitated person is in the county where the incapacitated person resides or is present. If the incapacitated person is admitted to an institution pursuant to order of a court of competent jurisdiction, venue is also in the county in which that court sits.

#### Section 14-5303. Procedure for court appointment of a guardian of an alleged incapacitated person

A. The alleged incapacitated person or any person interested in that person's affairs or welfare may petition for the appointment of a guardian or for any other appropriate protective order.

B. The petition shall contain a statement that the authority granted to the guardian may include the authority to withhold or withdraw life sustaining treatment, including artificial food and fluid, and shall state, at a minimum and to the extent known, all of the following:

1. The interest of the petitioner.

2. The name, age, residence and address of the alleged incapacitated person.

3. The name, address and priority for appointment of the person whose appointment is sought.

4. The name and address of the conservator, if any, of the alleged incapacitated person.

5. The name and address of the nearest relative of the alleged incapacitated person known to the petitioner.

6. A general statement of the property of the alleged incapacitated person, with an estimate of its value and including any compensation, insurance, pension or allowance to which the person is entitled.

7. The reason why appointment of a guardian or any other protective order is necessary.

8. The type of guardianship requested.  If a general guardianship is requested, the petition must state that other alternatives have been explored and why a limited guardianship is not appropriate.  If a limited guardianship is requested, the petition also must state what specific powers are requested.

9. If a legal decision-making, parenting time or visitation order was previously entered regarding an alleged incapacitated person in a marriage dissolution, legal separation or paternity action in this state or another jurisdiction and the petitioner or proposed guardian is a parent of the alleged incapacitated person or a nonparent who has been awarded legal decision-making as to the alleged incapacitated person, the court and case number for that action or proceeding and include a copy of the most recent court order regarding legal decision-making, parenting time and visitation.

10. If the appointment of a guardian is necessary due solely to the physical incapacity of the alleged incapacitated person.

C. On the filing of a petition, the court shall set a hearing date on the issues of incapacity. Unless the alleged incapacitated person is represented by independent counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent that person in the proceeding. The alleged incapacitated person shall be interviewed by an investigator appointed by the court and shall be examined by a physician, psychologist or registered nurse appointed by the court.  If the alleged incapacitated person has an established relationship with a physician, psychologist or registered nurse who is determined by the court to be qualified to evaluate the capacity of the alleged incapacitated person, the court may appoint the alleged incapacitated person's physician, psychologist or registered nurse pursuant to this subsection. The investigator and the person conducting the examination shall submit their reports in writing to the court. In addition to information required under subsection D, the court may direct that either report include other information the court deems appropriate. The investigator also shall interview the person seeking appointment as guardian, visit the present place of abode of the alleged incapacitated person and the place where it is proposed that the person will be detained or reside if the requested appointment is made and submit a report in writing to the court. The alleged incapacitated person is entitled to be present at the hearing and to see or hear all evidence bearing on that person's condition. The alleged incapacitated person is entitled to be represented by counsel, to present evidence, to cross-examine witnesses, including the court-appointed examiner and investigator, and to trial by jury. The court may determine the issue at a closed hearing if the alleged incapacitated person or that person's counsel so requests.

D. A report filed pursuant to this section by a physician, psychologist or registered nurse acting within that person's scope of practice shall include the following information:

1. A specific description of the physical, psychiatric or psychological diagnosis of the person.

2. A comprehensive assessment listing any functional impairments of the alleged incapacitated person and an explanation of how and to what extent these functional impairments may prevent that person from receiving or evaluating information in making decisions or in communicating informed decisions regarding that person.

3. An analysis of the tasks of daily living the alleged incapacitated person is capable of performing without direction or with minimal direction.

4. A list of all medications the alleged incapacitated person is receiving, the dosage of the medications and a description of the effects each medication has on the person's behavior to the best of the declarant's knowledge.

5. A prognosis for improvement in the alleged incapacitated person's condition and a recommendation for the most appropriate rehabilitation plan or care plan.

6. Other information the physician, psychologist or registered nurse deems appropriate.

 

#### Section 14-5304. Findings; limitations; filing; fingerprinting

A. In exercising its appointment authority pursuant to this chapter, the court shall encourage the development of maximum self-reliance and independence of the incapacitated person.

B. The court may appoint a general or limited guardian as requested if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that:

1. The person for whom a guardian is sought is incapacitated.

2. The appointment is necessary to provide for the demonstrated needs of the incapacitated person.

3. The person's needs cannot be met by less restrictive means, including the use of appropriate technological assistance.

C. In conformity with the evidence regarding the extent of the ward's incapacity, the court may appoint a limited guardian and specify time limits on the guardianship and limitations on the guardian's powers.

D. The guardian shall file an acceptance of appointment with the appointing court.

E. The court may require each person who seeks appointment as a guardian to furnish a full set of fingerprints to enable the court to conduct a criminal background investigation. The court shall submit the person's completed fingerprint card to the department of public safety.  The person shall bear the cost of obtaining the person's criminal history record information. The cost shall not exceed the actual cost of obtaining the person's criminal history record information. Criminal history records checks shall be conducted pursuant to section 41-1750 and Public Law 92-544. The department of public safety may exchange this fingerprint data with the federal bureau of investigation. This subsection does not apply to a fiduciary who is licensed pursuant to section 14-5651 or an employee of a financial institution.

F. The court shall make a specific finding as to whether the appointment of a guardian is due solely to the ward's physical incapacity.

G. Unless the court makes a specific finding that the appointment of a guardian is due solely to the ward's physical incapacity under subsection F of this section, at the time of appointing a guardian, the court shall transmit the ward's name, sex and date of birth, the last four digits of the ward's social security number, if available, the court case number, the court originating agency identification number and the date of the guardian's appointment to the supreme court. The supreme court shall transmit the information to the department of public safety. The department of public safety shall transmit the information to the national instant criminal background check system.

H. If a petition for guardianship is withdrawn before an adjudication of incapacity or is denied based on a finding that the allegation of incapacity is unproven or if a petition for guardianship was filed frivolously or without merit, the court may order public access to the file, the records contained in the file, or information about the file be prohibited absent a subsequent court order allowing such access after a showing of good cause.

#### Section 14-5304.01. Effect of appointment of guardian on privilege to operate a motor vehicle

A. On the appointment of a guardian, the court may determine that the ward's privilege to obtain or retain a driver license should be suspended and issue an order suspending the privilege.

B. If the court is presented with sufficient medical or other  evidence to establish that the ward's incapacity does not prevent the ward from safely operating a motor vehicle, it may decline to suspend the ward's privilege to obtain or retain a driver license and issue an order allowing the ward to obtain or retain a driver license.

C. The finding of interim incapacity pursuant to section 14-5310 does not cause the suspension of the ward's privilege to obtain or retain a driver license or to operate a motor vehicle pursuant to section 28-3153 unless the court also finds that the interim incapacity affects the ward's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle and that the privilege should be immediately suspended. In lieu of ordering the ward's driver license suspended, the court may order the ward not to drive a motor vehicle until the ward presents sufficient medical or other evidence to establish that the ward's interim incapacity does not affect the ward's ability to safely operate a motor vehicle.  The ward may present the medical or other evidence by motion to the court.  The court may rule on the motion without hearing if there are no objections to the motion.

D. A ward whose privilege to obtain or retain a driver license has been suspended or revoked by court order may file a request to terminate the suspension or revocation and reinstate the privilege. In reaching its decision the court shall consider medical evidence that the ward's incapacity does not prevent the ward from safely operating a motor vehicle and may consider other evidence, including a certificate of graduation from an accredited driving school with a recommendation that the ward should be extended driving privileges.  If the court grants the order terminating the suspension or revocation and reinstating the privilege, the ward may apply to the department of transportation for the issuance or reinstatement of a driver license and must comply with all applicable department rules.

E. An order terminating a temporary or permanent guardianship is an order terminating any incapacity previously adjudicated and vacates any previous orders suspending or revoking the person's privilege to obtain or retain a driver license. The person may apply to the department of transportation for the issuance or reinstatement of a driver license and must comply with all applicable department rules.

 

#### Section 14-5304.02. Limited guardianship; voting

A person for whom a limited guardian is appointed shall retain the right to vote if the person files a petition, has a hearing and the judge determines by clear and convincing evidence that the person retains sufficient understanding to exercise the right to vote.

 

#### Section 14-5305. Acceptance of appointment; consent to jurisdiction

By accepting appointment, a guardian submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the guardianship that may be instituted by any interested person. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the guardian or mailed to him by ordinary mail at his address as listed in the court records and to his address as then known to the petitioner.

#### Section 14-5306. Termination of guardianship for incapacitated person

Except pursuant to section 14-5317, the authority and responsibility of a guardian for an incapacitated person terminates on the death of the guardian or ward, a determination of incapacity of the guardian, or substitution or resignation as provided in section 14-5307. Testamentary appointment under an informally probated will terminates if the will is later denied probate in a formal proceeding. Termination does not affect the guardian's liability for prior acts or the guardian's obligation to account for funds and assets of the guardian's ward.

 

#### Section 14-5307. Substitution or resignation of guardian; termination of incapacity

A. On petition of the ward or any person interested in the ward's welfare, or on the court's own initiative, the court shall substitute a guardian and appoint a successor if it is in the best interest of the ward.  The court does not need to find that the guardian acted inappropriately to find that the substitution is in the ward's best interest. The guardian and the guardian's attorney may be compensated from the ward's estate for defending against a petition for substitution only for the amount ordered by the court and on petition by the guardian or the guardian's attorney. When substituting a guardian and appointing a successor, the court may appoint an individual nominated by the ward if the ward is at least fourteen years of age and has, in the opinion of the court, sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice.  On petition of the guardian, the court may accept a resignation and make any other order that may be appropriate.

B. The ward may petition the court for an order that the ward is no longer incapacitated or petition for substitution of the guardian at any time.  A request for this order may be made by informal letter to the court or judge.  A person who knowingly interferes with the transmission of this request may be found in contempt of court.

C. An interested person, other than the guardian or ward, shall not file a petition for adjudication that the ward is no longer incapacitated earlier than one year after the order adjudicating incapacity was entered unless the court permits it to be made on the basis of affidavits that there is reason to believe that the ward is no longer incapacitated.

D. An interested person, other than the guardian or ward, shall not file a petition to substitute a guardian earlier than one year after the order adjudicating incapacity was entered unless the court permits it to be made on the basis of affidavits that there is reason to believe that the current guardian will endanger the ward's physical, mental or emotional health if not substituted.

E. Before substituting a guardian, accepting the resignation of a guardian or ordering that a ward's incapacity has terminated, the court, following the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the ward as apply to a petition for appointment of a guardian, may send an investigator to the residence of the present guardian and to the place where the ward resides or is detained to observe conditions and report in writing to the court.

F. On termination of the incapacity, the supreme court shall transmit the order terminating the incapacity to the department of public safety. The department of public safety shall transmit the information to the national instant criminal background check system.

 

#### Section 14-5308. Court appointed investigators; qualifications; duties

A. An investigator appointed by the court under sections 14-5303 and 14-5407 shall have a background in law, nursing or social work and shall have no personal interest in the proceedings.

B. The investigator shall conduct an investigation before the court appoints a guardian or a conservator to allow the court to determine the appropriateness of that appointment. As directed by the court, the investigator shall conduct additional investigations to determine if it is necessary to continue the appointment.

C. In conducting investigations the investigator shall:

1. Interview the alleged incapacitated person or the protected person and the proposed guardian or conservator.

2. Visit the alleged incapacitated person's or the protected person's current or proposed place of residence.

3. Interview nursing home or care home care givers and the home's manager or administrator.

4. Transport the alleged incapacitated person or the protected person as directed by the court.

D. In conducting interviews under this section the investigator may examine any court record, medical record or financial record that relates to the investigation.

E. As a condition of appointment as an investigator the court shall require the applicant to furnish a full set of fingerprints to enable the court to conduct a criminal background investigation to determine the applicant's suitability. The court shall submit the completed fingerprint card to the department of public safety. The department shall provide the applicant's criminal history record information to the court pursuant to section 41-1750. The department of public safety shall conduct criminal history records checks pursuant to section 41-1750 and applicable federal law.  The department of public safety is authorized to submit fingerprint card information to the federal bureau of investigation for a national criminal history records check.

F. An investigator appointed by the court pursuant to sections 14-5303 and 14-5407, and any person or entity closely related to the investigator, shall not be appointed as a fiduciary, attorney or professional in the same case or for the same person who was the subject of the prior investigation unless otherwise ordered by the court for good cause. For the purposes of this subsection, "closely related" includes a spouse, child, parent, sibling, grandparent, aunt, uncle or cousin of the investigator and any business, partnership, corporation, limited liability company, trust or other entity that the investigator or a closely related person has a financial interest in, is employed by or receives compensation or financial benefit from.

 

#### Section 14-5309. Notices in guardianship proceedings

A. In a proceeding for a contact order or modification of a contact order pursuant to section 14-5316 or for the appointment or substitution of a guardian of a ward or an alleged incapacitated person other than the appointment of a temporary guardian or temporary suspension of a guardian, notice of a hearing shall be given to each of the following:

1. The ward or the alleged incapacitated person and that person's spouse, parents and adult children.

2. Any person who is serving as guardian or conservator or who has the care and custody of the ward or the alleged incapacitated person.

3. In case no other person is notified under paragraph 1 of this subsection, at least one of that person's closest adult relatives, if any can be found.

4. Any person who has filed a demand for notice.

B. At least fourteen days before the hearing notice shall be served personally on the ward or the alleged incapacitated person and that person's spouse and parents if they can be found within the state. Notice to the spouse and parents, if they cannot be found within the state, and to all other persons except the ward or the alleged incapacitated person shall be given as provided in section 14-1401. Waiver of notice by the ward or the alleged incapacitated person is not effective unless that person attends the hearing.

 

#### Section 14-5310. Temporary guardians; appointment; notice; court appointed attorney hearings; duties

A. If an alleged incapacitated person has no guardian and an emergency exists or if an appointed guardian is not effectively performing the duties of a guardian and the welfare of the ward is found to require immediate action, the alleged incapacitated person, the ward or any person interested in the welfare of the alleged incapacitated person or the ward may petition for a finding of interim incapacity and for the appointment of a temporary guardian. No finding and appointment may be made without notice, pursuant to section 14-5309, except as provided in subsection B of this section.

B. The court may enter a finding of interim incapacity and may appoint a temporary guardian without notice to the proposed ward or the proposed ward's attorney only if all of the following conditions are met:

1. It clearly appears from specific facts shown by an affidavit or by the verified petition that immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage will result before the proposed ward or the proposed ward's attorney can be heard in opposition.

2. The petitioner or the petitioner's attorney certifies to the court in writing any efforts that the petitioner or the petitioner's attorney has made to give the notice or the reasons supporting the claim that notice should not be required.

3. The petitioner files with the court a request for a hearing on the petition for the appointment of a temporary guardian.

4. The petitioner or the petitioner's attorney certifies that that person will give notice of the petition, the order and all filed reports and affidavits to the proposed ward by personal service within the time period the court directs but not in excess of seventy-two hours following entry of the order of appointment.

5. The petitioner files a report from a physician, a registered nurse practitioner or a psychologist detailing the need for a guardian and the basis for the emergency unless the report is waived by the court on a showing of good cause by a party to the action.

C. Unless the proposed ward is represented by independent counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent the proposed ward in the proceeding on receipt of the petition for temporary appointment. The attorney shall visit the proposed ward as soon as practicable and shall be prepared to represent the interest of the proposed ward at any hearing on the petition.

D. Every order finding interim incapacity and appointing a temporary guardian granted without notice expires as prescribed by the court but within a period of not more than thirty days unless within that time the court extends it for good cause shown for the same period or unless the attorney for the ward consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The court shall enter the reasons for the extension on the record.

E. The court shall schedule a hearing on the petition for a finding of interim incapacity and the appointment of a temporary guardian within the time specified in subsection D of this section. If the petitioner does not proceed with the petition the court, on the motion of any party or on its own motion, may dismiss the petition.

F. If the court orders the appointment of a temporary guardian without notice, the ward may appear and move for its dissolution or modification on two days' notice to the petitioner and to the temporary guardian or on such shorter notice as the court prescribes. The court shall proceed to hear and determine that motion as expeditiously as possible.

G. If the ward objects to the person who is temporarily appointed, the court may appoint an individual nominated by the proposed ward if the ward is at least fourteen years of age and has, in the opinion of the court, sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice.  The court shall appoint an alternative guardian if available and after finding that the appointment is in the best interest of the ward.

H. The hearing on a petition for the appointment of a temporary guardian shall be held in the same manner as a hearing on a preliminary injunction. The court may order the hearing on the petition for appointment of a permanent guardian to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing of the petition for temporary appointment. If the court does not order this consolidation any evidence received on a petition for temporary appointment that would be admissible at the hearing on a petition for a permanent appointment becomes part of the record and need not be repeated at a later hearing.  This subsection does not limit the parties to any rights they may have to trial by jury.

I. After notice and a hearing, if the court finds that a temporary guardian is necessary and the provisions of this section have been met, the court shall make an appointment of a temporary guardian for a specific purpose and for a specific period of time of not more than six months unless the court extends this time period for good cause shown.

J. A temporary guardian is responsible to provide the care and custody of the ward. The authority of a permanent guardian previously appointed by the court is suspended as long as the temporary guardian has authority. A temporary guardian may be removed at any time. A temporary guardian shall make any report the court requires. In all other respects, the provisions of this title concerning guardians apply to temporary guardians.

 

#### Section 14-5310.01. Adult protective services workers; special visitation warrants

A. Adult protective services workers of the department of economic security charged with responsibilities involving protection of incapacitated and abused, exploited or neglected adults may present themselves before the court to apply for and obtain special visitation warrants. The court shall limit such visitations to the residence of the adult believed to be incapacitated and abused, exploited or neglected. Nothing in this act shall be construed to mean that an adult is abused or neglected or in need of protective services for the sole reason that he relies on treatment from a recognized religious method of healing in lieu of medical treatment.

B. Upon showing by the affidavit of the protective services worker that consent to entry for visitation to an adult believed to be incapacitated and abused, exploited or neglected has been refused a special visitation warrant may be issued by the court for the visitation of the residence of the adult.

C. The warrant shall be in substantially the following form:

 

County of _______________, state of Arizona, to any peace officer accompanied by an adult protective services worker in the state of Arizona, proof, by affidavit attached hereto and made a part hereof for all purposes, having been this day made before me (by person or persons where affidavit has been taken) that there may exist a reasonable governmental interest to determine if _______________, an adult, may be incapacitated and abused, exploited or neglected. You are therefore commanded in the daytime to visit the residence of _______________, an adult, located at _______________, in the county of __________________, state of Arizona, and to visit ____________________ for the purpose of making a determination if the adult is in need of protective services and what services, if any, are needed.

D. All warrants issued are returnable to the issuing judge within seventy-two hours of issuance and shall thereafter be filed in the probate division of the office of the clerk of the superior court.

#### Section 14-5311. Who may be guardian; priorities

A. Any qualified person may be appointed guardian of an incapacitated person, subject to the requirements of section 14-5106.

B. The court may consider the following persons for appointment as guardian in the following order:

1. A guardian or conservator of the person or a fiduciary appointed or recognized by the appropriate court of any jurisdiction in which the incapacitated person resides.

2. An individual or corporation nominated by the incapacitated person if the person has, in the opinion of the court, sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice.

3. The person nominated to serve as guardian in the incapacitated person's most recent durable power of attorney or health care power of attorney.

4. The spouse of the incapacitated person.

5. An adult child of the incapacitated person.

6. A parent of the incapacitated person, including a person nominated by will or other writing signed by a deceased parent.

7. Any relative of the incapacitated person with whom the incapacitated person has resided for more than six months before the filing of the petition.

8. The nominee of a person who is caring for or paying benefits to the incapacitated person.

9. If the incapacitated person is a veteran, the spouse of a veteran or the minor child of a veteran, the department of veterans' services.

10. A fiduciary who is licensed pursuant to section 14-5651, other than a public fiduciary.

11. A public fiduciary who is licensed pursuant to section 14-5651.

C. A person listed in subsection B, paragraph 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 of this section may nominate in writing a person to serve in that person's place. With respect to persons who have equal priority, the court shall select the one the court determines is best qualified to serve.

D. Notwithstanding the priorities set forth in subsection B of this section, if the petition for appointment of a guardian for the incapacitated person is filed pursuant to section 14-5301.03 or within two years after the incapacitated person's eighteenth birthday, unless the court finds the appointment to be contrary to the incapacitated person's best interest:

1. The court shall appoint as the incapacitated person's guardian any person who, by court order, had sole legal decision-making of the incapacitated person when the incapacitated person attained eighteen years of age.

2. If two persons had joint legal decision-making of the incapacitated person when the incapacitated person attained eighteen years of age, the court shall appoint both persons as the incapacitated person's co-guardians.

E. The court may appoint more than one person as the incapacitated person's co-guardians if the appointment is required by subsection D of this section or the court finds that the appointment is in the incapacitated person's best interest.  If the court appoints co-guardians, the co-guardians shall share decision-making for the incapacitated person and neither co-guardian's rights or responsibilities are superior except as otherwise ordered by the court.

F. For good cause the court may pass over a person who has priority and appoint a person who has a lower priority or no priority. For the purposes of this subsection, "good cause" includes a determination that:

1. The incapacitated person's durable power of attorney or health care power of attorney is invalid.

2. Honoring the incapacitated person's durable power of attorney or health care power of attorney would not be in the physical, emotional or financial best interest of the incapacitated person.

3. The estimated cost of the fiduciary and associated professional fees would adversely affect the ability of the incapacitated person's estate to provide for the incapacitated person's reasonable and necessary living expenses.

G. On a request by a person who was passed over by the court pursuant to subsection F of this section, the court shall make a specific finding regarding the court's determination of good cause and why the person was not appointed.  The request must be made within ten days after the entry of the order.

 

#### Section 14-5312. General powers and duties of guardian

A. A guardian of an incapacitated person has the same powers, rights and duties respecting the guardian's ward that a parent has respecting the parent's unemancipated minor child, except that a guardian is not liable to third persons for acts of the ward solely by reason of the guardianship. In particular, and without qualifying the foregoing, a guardian has the following powers and duties, except as modified by order of the court:

1. To the extent that it is consistent with the terms of any order by a court of competent jurisdiction relating to detention or commitment of the ward, the guardian is entitled to custody of the person of the ward and may establish the ward's place of abode within or without this state.

2. If entitled to custody of the ward the guardian shall make provision for the care, comfort and maintenance of the ward and, whenever appropriate, arrange for the ward's training and education. Without regard to custodial rights of the ward's person, the guardian shall take reasonable care of the ward's clothing, furniture, vehicles and other personal effects and commence protective proceedings if other property of the ward is in need of protection.

3. A guardian may give any consents or approvals that may be necessary to enable the ward to receive medical or other professional care, counsel, treatment or service.

4. If no conservator for the estate of the ward has been appointed, the guardian may:

(a) Institute proceedings to compel any person under a duty to support the ward or to pay sums for the welfare of the ward to perform such person's duty.

(b) Receive money and tangible property deliverable to the ward and apply the money and property for support, care and education of the ward, but the guardian may not use funds from his ward's estate for room and board the guardian or the guardian's spouse, parent or child has furnished the ward unless a charge for the service is approved by order of the court made upon notice to at least one of the next of kin of the ward, if notice is possible. He must exercise care to conserve any excess for the ward's needs.

5. A guardian is required to report the condition of the ward and of the estate that has been subject to the guardian's possession or control, as required by the court or court rule.

6. If a conservator has been appointed, all of the ward's estate received by the guardian in excess of those funds expended to meet current expenses for support, care and education of the ward shall be paid to the conservator for management as provided in this chapter and the guardian must account to the conservator for funds expended.

7. If appropriate, a guardian shall encourage the ward to develop maximum self-reliance and independence and shall actively work toward limiting or terminating the guardianship and seeking alternatives to guardianship.

8. A guardian shall find the most appropriate and least restrictive setting for the ward consistent with the ward's needs, capabilities and financial ability.

9. A guardian shall make reasonable efforts to secure appropriate medical and psychological care and social services for the ward.

10. A guardian shall make reasonable efforts to secure appropriate training, education and social and vocational opportunities for his ward in order to maximize the ward's potential for independence.

11. In making decisions concerning his ward, a guardian shall take into consideration the ward's values and wishes.

12. The guardian is authorized to act pursuant to title 36, chapter 32.

13. The guardian of an incapacitated adult who has a developmental disability as defined in section 36-551 shall seek services that are in the best interest of the ward, taking into consideration:

(a) The ward's age.

(b) The degree or type of developmental disability.

(c) The presence of other disabling conditions.

(d) The guardian's ability to provide the maximum opportunity to develop the ward's maximum potential, to provide a minimally structured residential program and environment for the ward and to provide a safe, secure, and dependable residential and program environment.

(e) The particular desires of the individual.

B. Any guardian of a ward for whom a conservator also has been appointed shall control the custody and care of the ward and is entitled to receive reasonable sums for the guardian's services and for room and board furnished to the ward as agreed upon between the guardian and the conservator if the amounts agreed upon are reasonable under the circumstances. The guardian may request the conservator to expend the ward's estate by payment to third persons or institutions for the ward's care and maintenance.

 

#### Section 14-5312.01. Inpatient treatment; rights and duties of ward and guardian

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, a guardian of an incapacitated person may consent to psychiatric and psychological care and treatment, including the administration of psychotropic medications, if the care and treatment take place outside an inpatient psychiatric facility licensed by the department of health services.

B. On clear and convincing evidence that the ward is an incapacitated person and is likely to be in need of inpatient mental health care and treatment within the period of the authority granted pursuant to this section, the court may authorize a guardian appointed pursuant to this title to give consent for the ward to receive inpatient mental health care and treatment, including placement in an inpatient psychiatric facility licensed by the department of health services and medical, psychiatric and psychological treatment associated with that placement. The evidence shall be supported by the opinion of a mental health expert who is either a physician licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 and who is a specialist in psychiatry or a psychologist who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 19.1.

C. In making its decision to grant authority to a guardian pursuant to subsection B of this section, the court shall consider the cause of the ward's disability and the ward's foreseeable clinical needs. The court shall limit the guardian's authority to what is reasonably necessary to obtain the care required for the ward in the least restrictive treatment alternative. The court may limit the duration of the guardian's authority to consent to inpatient mental health care and treatment and include other orders the court determines necessary to protect the ward's best interests.

D. Within forty-eight hours after placement of the ward pursuant to this section, the guardian shall give notice of this action to the ward's attorney.  When the attorney receives this notice the attorney shall assess the appropriateness of the placement pursuant to section 36-537, subsection B and section 36-546, subsection H. If requested by the attorney, the court shall hold a hearing on the appropriateness of the placement within three days after receiving that request.

E. The inpatient psychiatric facility shall assess the appropriateness of the ward's placement every thirty days and shall provide a copy of the assessment report to the ward's attorney on request. The ward's attorney may attend the ward's evaluation, staffing, treatment team and case management meetings.

F. When the ward is admitted to an inpatient psychiatric facility pursuant to this section, the guardian shall provide the facility with the name, address and telephone number of the ward's attorney. The facility shall include this information in the ward's treatment record.

G. Within twenty-four hours after the facility receives any writing in which the ward requests release from the facility, any change in placement or a change in the type or duration of treatment, the facility shall forward this information to the ward's attorney.

H. All health care providers, treatment facilities and regional behavioral health authorities shall allow the ward's attorney access to all of the ward's medical, psychiatric, psychological and other treatment records.

I. The ward's guardian shall place the ward in a least restrictive treatment alternative within five days after the guardian is notified by the medical director of the inpatient facility that the ward no longer needs inpatient care. The ward, a representative of the inpatient treatment facility, the ward's attorney, the ward's physician or any other interested person may petition the court to order the facility to discharge the ward to a least restrictive treatment alternative if the guardian does not act promptly to do so.

J. If the ward is in an inpatient psychiatric facility at the time of the initial hearing on the petition for appointment of a guardian, the court investigator and the ward's attorney shall advise the court of the appropriateness of the placement.

K. An attorney appointed pursuant to section 14-5303, subsection C remains the attorney of record until the attorney is discharged by the court. The court shall ensure that a ward whose guardian has been granted inpatient mental health treatment authority is represented by an attorney at all times the guardian has that authority. Unless the court finds that the ward has insufficient assets to meet the ward's reasonable and necessary care and living expenses, the ward shall pay the attorney's reasonable fees.

L. If deemed necessary to adequately assess a request for inpatient mental health treatment authority or to review the ward's placement in an inpatient psychiatric facility, the court may order an independent evaluation by either a physician who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 and who is a specialist in psychiatry or a psychologist who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 19.1. If the ward has insufficient funds to pay the total cost of this evaluation, the court may deem all or any part of the evaluator's fee to be a county expense after determining the reasonableness of that fee.

M. Instead of ordering an independent evaluation pursuant to subsection L of this section, the court may accept a report conducted on behalf of the inpatient psychiatric facility if the court finds that the report meets the requirements of an independent evaluation.

N. The court may decide that the ward's right to retain or obtain a driver license and any other civil right that may be suspended by operation of law is not affected by the appointment of a guardian.

O. If the court grants the guardian the authority to consent to inpatient mental health care and treatment pursuant to this section, the medical director of an inpatient psychiatric facility licensed by the department of health services may admit the ward at the guardian's request.

P. A guardian who is authorized by the court to consent to inpatient mental health care and treatment pursuant to this section shall file with the annual report of the guardian required pursuant to section 14-5315 an evaluation report by a physician or a psychologist who meets the requirements of subsection B of this section. The evaluation report shall indicate if the ward will likely need inpatient mental health care and treatment within the period of the authority granted pursuant to this section. If the guardian does not file the evaluation report or if the report indicates that the ward will not likely need inpatient mental health care and treatment, the guardian's authority to consent to this treatment ceases on the expiration of the period specified in the prior court order.  If the report supports the continuation of the guardian's authority to consent to inpatient treatment, the court may order that the guardian's authority to consent to this treatment continues. If the report supports the continuation of the guardian's authority to consent to this treatment, the ward's attorney shall review the report with the ward. The ward may contest the continuation of the guardian's authority by filing a request for a court hearing within ten business days after the report is filed. The court shall hold this hearing within thirty calendar days after it receives the request.  The guardian's authority continues pending the court's ruling on the issue.  At the hearing the guardian has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the ward is likely to be in need of inpatient mental health care and treatment within the period of the authority granted pursuant to this section.

Q. The court may discharge an attorney who was appointed pursuant to section 14-5303, subsection C subsequent to the appointment of a guardian if it clearly appears from specific facts presented by affidavit or verified petition that continued representation of the ward is no longer necessary or desirable.  The factual basis must include, at a minimum, consideration of the following:

1. The nature and history of the ward's illness.

2. The ward's history of hospitalization.

3. The ward's current and anticipated living arrangements.

4. Whether the ward's inpatient treatment is anticipated to be a one-time hospitalization for the purpose of stabilizing the ward's condition and further hospitalizations are not likely to be necessary.

5. Whether the ward's current and anticipated living arrangements are the least restrictive alternatives possible.

Notwithstanding the procedures and requirements prescribed in title 36, chapter 5, articles 4 and 5 relating to involuntary court-ordered evaluation or treatment, if the guardian who is granted the authority to consent to inpatient mental health care or treatment pursuant to section 14-5312.01 has reasonable cause to believe that the ward is in need of evaluation or treatment, the guardian may apply for admission of the ward for evaluation or treatment at any inpatient psychiatric facility. The guardian must present the facility with a certified copy, or a photocopy of the certified copy, of the guardian's letters of guardianship.

B. If the guardian requests admission, the facility to which the guardian applies may admit the person if before admission a physician who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 does all of the following:

1. Conducts an investigation that carefully probes the ward's psychiatric and psychological history, diagnosis and treatment needs.

2. Conducts a thorough interview with the ward and the guardian.

5. Documents in the ward's medical chart a summary of the doctor's findings and recommendations for treatment.

C. After admission, if the ward refuses treatment or requests discharge and the treating physician believes that further inpatient treatment is necessary or advisable, the facility may rely on the consent of the guardian for treatment, release and discharge decisions pursuant to the guardian's authority under the guardianship.

 

#### Section 14-5313. Proceedings subsequent to appointment; venue

A. The court at the place where the ward resides has concurrent jurisdiction with the court that appointed the guardian or in which acceptance of a parental or spousal appointment was filed, over resignation, substitution, accounting and other proceedings relating to the guardianship including proceedings to limit the authority previously conferred on a guardian or to remove limitations previously imposed.

B. If the court located at the place where the ward resides is not the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed, the court in which proceedings subsequent to appointment are commenced shall in all appropriate cases notify the other court, in this or another state, and after consultation with that court shall determine whether to retain jurisdiction or transfer the proceedings to the other court, whichever may be in the best interests of the ward. A copy of any order accepting a resignation, substituting a guardian or altering authority shall be sent to the court in which acceptance of appointment is filed.

In making these determinations, the court may consider any evidence it deems appropriate.

Appointment of a conservator or other protective order may be made in relation to the estate and affairs of a minor if the court determines that a minor owns money or property that requires management or protection that cannot otherwise be provided or has or may have affairs that may be jeopardized or prevented by minority or that funds are needed for the minor's support and education and that protection is necessary or desirable to obtain or provide funds.

2. Appointment of a conservator or other protective order may be made in relation to the estate and affairs of a person if the court specifically finds on the record both of the following:

The department of public safety may exchange this fingerprint data with the federal bureau of investigation.  This subsection does not apply to a fiduciary who is licensed pursuant to section 14-5651 or an employee of a financial institution.

 

#### Section 14-5401.01. Temporary conservators; appointment; notice; hearings

A. If a person allegedly in need of protection has no conservator and an emergency exists or if an appointed conservator is not effectively performing the duties of a conservator and the estate or affairs of the protected person are found to require immediate action, the person allegedly in need of protection, the protected person or any person interested in that person's estate or affairs may petition for a finding of a need for interim protection and for the appointment of a temporary conservator. A finding and appointment may not be made without notice, pursuant to section 14-5405, except as provided in subsection B of this section.

B. The court may enter a finding of a need for interim protection and may appoint a temporary conservator without notice to the person allegedly in need of protection or that person's attorney if all of the following conditions are met:

1. It clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or by the verified petition that immediate and irreparable injury, loss or damage will result before the person allegedly in need of protection or that person's attorney can be heard in opposition.

2. The petitioner or the petitioner's attorney certifies to the court in writing any efforts that the petitioner or the attorney has made to give the notice or the reasons supporting the claim that notice should not be required.

3. The petitioner files with the court a request for a hearing on the petition for the appointment of a temporary conservator.

4. The petitioner or the petitioner's attorney certifies that notice of the petition, order and all filed reports and affidavits will be given to the person allegedly in need of protection by personal service within the time period the court directs but not more than seventy-two hours after entry of the order of appointment.

C. Unless the person allegedly in need of protection is represented by independent counsel, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent that person in the proceeding on receipt of the petition for temporary appointment. The attorney shall visit the person allegedly in need of protection as soon as practicable and shall be prepared to represent that person's interests at any hearing on the petition.

D. Every order finding a need for interim protection and appointing a temporary conservator granted without notice expires as prescribed by the court but within a period of not more than thirty days unless within that time the court extends it for good cause shown for the same period or unless the attorney for the person allegedly in need of protection consents that it may be extended for a longer period. The court shall enter the reasons for the extension on the record.

E. The court shall schedule a hearing on the petition for a finding of the need for interim protection and the appointment of a temporary conservator within the time specified in subsection D of this section. If the petitioner does not proceed with the petition the court, on the motion of any party or on its own motion, may dismiss the petition.

F. If the court orders the appointment of a temporary conservator without notice, the person allegedly in need of protection may appear and move for its dissolution or modification on two days' notice to the petitioner and to the temporary conservator, or on such shorter notice as the court prescribes.  The court shall proceed to hear and determine that motion as expeditiously as possible.  If the person allegedly in need of protection objects to the person who is temporarily appointed, the court may appoint an individual nominated by the person allegedly in need of protection if the person allegedly in need of protection is at least fourteen years of age and has, in the opinion of the court, sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice.  The court shall appoint an alternative conservator if available and after finding that the appointment is in the best interest of the person allegedly in need of protection.

G. The hearing on a petition for the appointment of a temporary conservator shall be held in the same manner as a hearing on a preliminary injunction. The court may order the hearing on the petition for appointment of a permanent conservator to be advanced and consolidated with the hearing on the petition for temporary appointment. If the court does not order this consolidation any evidence received on a petition for temporary appointment that would be admissible at the hearing on a petition for a permanent appointment becomes part of the record and need not be repeated at a later hearing. This subsection does not limit the parties to any rights they may have to trial by jury.

H. After notice and a hearing, if the court finds that a temporary conservator is necessary and the provisions of this section have been met, the court shall make an appointment of a temporary conservator for a specified period of time of not more than six months unless the court extends this time period for good cause shown.

#### Section 14-5406. Protective proceedings; request for notice; interested person

On payment of any required fee, any interested person who desires to be notified before any order is made in a guardianship or conservatorship proceeding, including any proceeding subsequent to the appointment of a guardian pursuant to section 14-5313, or subsequent to the appointment of a conservator pursuant to section 14-5416, may file a demand for notice with the clerk of the court in which the proceeding is pending. The person demanding notice shall mail a copy of the demand to the guardian and the conservator if one has been appointed. A demand is not effective unless it contains a statement showing the interest of the person making it and the person's address, or that of the person's attorney, and is effective only as to matters occurring after the filing. Any governmental agency paying or planning to pay benefits to the person to be protected is an interested person in protective proceedings.

#### Section 14-5407. Procedure concerning hearing and order on original petition

A. On the filing of a petition for appointment of a conservator or any other protective order because of minority, the court shall set a hearing date on the matters alleged in the petition. If, at any time in the proceeding, the court determines that the interests of the minor are or may be inadequately represented, it shall appoint an attorney to represent the minor. If the minor is at least fourteen years of age the court shall consider the choice of the minor.

B. On the filing of a petition for appointment of a conservator or any other protective order for reasons other than minority, or on the filing of a petition for continuation of a conservatorship or other protective order pursuant to section 14-5401, subsection B, the court shall set a hearing date. Unless the person to be protected has counsel of that person's own choice, the court shall appoint an attorney to represent that person. If the alleged disability is mental illness, mental deficiency, mental disorder, physical illness or disability, chronic use of drugs, or chronic intoxication, the court shall appoint an investigator to interview the person to be protected. On petition by an interested person or on the court's own motion, the court may direct that an appropriate medical or psychological evaluation of the person be conducted. The investigator and the person conducting the medical or psychological evaluation shall submit written reports to the court before the hearing date.

C. In any case where the veterans administration is or may be an interested party, a certificate of an authorized official of the veterans administration that the person allegedly in need of protection has been found incapable of handling the benefits payable, on examination in accordance with the laws and regulations governing the veterans administration, is prima facie evidence of the necessity for appointment of a conservator.

D. The person allegedly in need of protection is entitled to be present at the hearing, to be represented by counsel, to present evidence and to cross-examine witnesses, including any court appointed examiner and investigator.  The issue may be determined at a closed hearing if the person allegedly in need of protection or that person's counsel so requests.

E. After the hearing, and after making specific findings on the record that a basis for the appointment of a conservator or any other protective order has been established, the court shall make an appointment or other appropriate protective order.

 

#### Section 14-5408. Permissible court orders

A. The court has the following powers which may be exercised directly or through a conservator in respect to the estate and affairs of protected persons:

1. While a petition for appointment of a conservator or any other protective order is pending and after a preliminary hearing and without notice to others, the court has power to preserve and apply the estate of the person allegedly in need of protection as may be required for that person’s benefit or the benefit of that person’s dependents.

2. After a hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or any other protective order exists with respect to a minor without other disability, the court has all those powers over the estate and affairs of the minor which are or might be necessary for the best interests of the minor, the minor’s family and members of the minor’s household.

3. After a hearing and upon determining that a basis for an appointment or any other protective order exists with respect to a person for reasons other than minority, the court has, for the benefit of the protected person and members of that person’s household, all the powers over his estate and affairs which the protected person could exercise if present and not under disability, except the power to make a will or to make gifts other than those authorized by this section.

4. After notice and a hearing the court may authorize the conservator to make gifts on behalf of the protected person out of the estate of the protected person to donees and in amounts that are consistent with the protected person’s best interests and intentions. In determining if these gifts are in the protected person’s best interests the court shall consider:

(a) The protected person’s estate plan, if any.

(b) The protected person’s pattern of prior gifts, if any.

(c) The potential tax savings that would result if a gift were authorized.

(d) The size of the estate.

(e) The protected person’s income and expenses.

(f) The physical and mental condition and life expectancy of the protected person.

(g) The likelihood that the protected person’s disability may cease.

(h) The likelihood that the protected person would make the gift if the person were able to consent.

(i) The ability of the protected person to consent to the proposed gifts.

B. An order made pursuant to this section determining that a basis for appointment of a conservator or other protective order exists has no effect on the capacity of the protected person.

C. To encourage the self-reliance and independence of a protected person, the court may grant the protected person the ability to handle part of the protected person’s money or other property without the consent or supervision of the conservator. This may include allowing the protected person to maintain appropriate accounts in any bank or other financial institution.

#### Section 14-5409. Protective arrangements and single transactions authorized

A. If it is established in a proper proceeding that a basis exists as described in section 14-5401 for affecting the estate and affairs of a person the court, without appointing a conservator, may authorize, direct or ratify any transaction necessary or desirable to achieve any security, service or care arrangement meeting the foreseeable needs of the protected person. Protective arrangements include, but are not limited to, payment, delivery, deposit or retention of funds or property, sale, mortgage, lease or other transfer of property, entry into an annuity contract, a contract for life care, a deposit contract, a contract for training and education, or addition to or establishment of a suitable trust.

B. When it has been established in a proper proceeding that a basis exists as described in section 14-5401 for affecting the estate and affairs of a person the court, without appointing a conservator, may authorize, direct or ratify any contract, trust or other transaction relating to the protected person's financial affairs or involving the protected person's estate if the court determines that the transaction is in the best interests of the protected person.

C. Before approving a protective arrangement or other transaction under this section, the court shall consider the interests of creditors and dependents of the protected person and, in view of the protected person's disability, whether the protected person needs the continuing protection of a conservator. The court may appoint a special conservator to assist in the accomplishment of any protective arrangement or other transaction authorized under this section who shall have the authority conferred by the order and serve until discharged by order after report to the court of all matters done pursuant to the order of appointment.

#### Section 14-5410. Who may be appointed conservator; priorities

A. The court may appoint an individual or a corporation, with general power to serve as trustee, as conservator of the estate of a protected person subject to the requirements of section 14-5106. The following are entitled to consideration for appointment in the order listed:

1. A conservator, guardian of property or other like fiduciary appointed or recognized by the appropriate court of any other jurisdiction in which the protected person resides.

2. An individual or corporation nominated by the protected person if the protected person is at least fourteen years of age and has, in the opinion of the court, sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice.

3. The person nominated to serve as conservator in the protected person's most recent durable power of attorney.

4. The spouse of the protected person.

5. An adult child of the protected person.

6. A parent of the protected person, or a person nominated by the will of a deceased parent.

7. Any relative of the protected person with whom the protected person has resided for more than six months before the filing of the petition.

8. The nominee of a person who is caring for or paying benefits to the protected person.

B. A person listed in subsection A, paragraph 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 of this section may nominate in writing a person to serve in that person's place. With respect to persons having equal priority, the court shall select the one it determines is best qualified to serve. The court, for good cause, may pass over a person having priority and appoint a person having a lower priority or no priority.  For the purposes of this subsection, "good cause" includes a determination that:

1. The protected person's durable power of attorney is invalid.

2. Honoring the protected person's durable power of attorney would not be in the physical, emotional or financial best interest of the protected person.

3. The estimated cost of the fiduciary and associated professional fees would adversely affect the ability of the person's estate to provide for the protected person's reasonable and necessary living expenses.

C. On the request of a person who was passed over by the court pursuant to subsection B of this section, the court shall make a specific finding regarding the court's determination of good cause and why the person was not appointed.  The request must be made within ten days after the entry of the order.

 

#### Section 14-5411. Bond; exception

A. Except as otherwise provided in subsection B of this section, the court shall require a conservator to furnish a bond conditioned on faithful discharge of all duties according to law, with sureties as it shall specify. Unless otherwise directed, the bond shall be in the amount of the aggregate capital value of the property of the estate in the conservator's control plus one year's estimated income minus the value of securities deposited under arrangements requiring an order of the court for their removal and the value of any land that the fiduciary, by express limitation of power, lacks power to sell or convey without court authorization. For good cause shown the court may reduce or eliminate the bond to the extent of regular fixed expenses paid for the benefit of the protected person. The court in lieu of sureties on a bond may accept other security for the performance of the bond, including a pledge of securities or a mortgage of land.

B. A bond is not required of a conservator that is a national banking association, a holder of a banking permit under the laws of this state, a savings and loan association authorized to conduct trust business in this state, a title insurance company qualified to do business under the laws of this state, a trust company holding a certificate to engage in trust business from the deputy director of the financial institutions division of the department of insurance and financial institutions or the public fiduciary.

#### Section 14-5412. Terms and requirements of bonds

A. The following requirements and provisions apply to any bond required under section 14-5411:

1. Unless otherwise provided by the terms of the approved bond, sureties are jointly and severally liable with the conservator and with each other.

2. By executing an approved bond of a conservator, the surety consents to the jurisdiction of the court which issued letters to the primary obligor in any proceeding pertaining to the fiduciary duties of the conservator and naming the surety as a party respondent. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the surety or mailed by certified mail to the address listed with the court at the place where the bond is filed and to the address as then known to the petitioner.

3. On petition of a successor conservator or any interested person, a proceeding may be initiated against a surety for breach of the obligation of the bond of the conservator.

4. The bond of the conservator is not void after the first recovery but may be proceeded against from time to time until the whole penalty is exhausted.

B. No proceeding may be commenced against the surety on any matter as to which an action or proceeding against the primary obligor is barred by adjudication or limitation.

#### Section 14-5413. Acceptance of appointment; consent to jurisdiction

By accepting appointment, a conservator submits personally to the jurisdiction of the court in any proceeding relating to the estate that may be instituted by any interested person. Notice of any proceeding shall be delivered to the conservator, or mailed to him by registered or certified mail at his address as listed in the petition for appointment or as thereafter reported to the court and to his address as then known to the petitioner.

#### Section 14-5414. Compensation and expenses; definitions

A. If not otherwise compensated for services rendered, any investigator, accountant, lawyer, physician, registered nurse, psychologist, guardian ad litem or conservator who is appointed in a protective proceeding, including a lawyer of the person alleged to be in need of protection pursuant to section 14-5407, subsection B, is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate of the protected person if the petition is granted or from the petitioner if the petition is denied.

B. If the petitioner withdraws the petition or if the court dismisses the petition because of the petitioner's failure to prosecute, the court may order that the compensation of the investigator, accountant, lawyer, physician, registered nurse, psychologist, guardian ad litem or conservator who is appointed pursuant to this article, including a lawyer of the person alleged to be in need of protection pursuant to section 14-5407, subsection B, be paid either from the protected person's estate or by the petitioner, depending on the facts and circumstances.  In making these determinations, the court may consider any evidence it deems appropriate.

C. A lawyer who is employed by the conservator to represent the conservator in the conservator's appointment or duties as conservator is entitled to reasonable compensation from the estate if the petition is granted.  If the petitioner withdraws the petition or if the petition is dismissed because of the petitioner's failure to prosecute, the court may order that the compensation of the proposed conservator's lawyer be paid either from the protected person's estate or by the petitioner, depending on the facts and circumstances.  In determining which party shall pay, the court may consider any evidence it deems appropriate.

D. A lawyer who is employed by the petitioner to represent the petitioner in seeking the appointment of a conservator is entitled to reasonable compensation from the protected person's estate if the petition is granted.

E. If the court pays for any of these services it may charge the estate for reasonable compensation. The clerk shall deposit monies it collects in the probate fund pursuant to section 14-5433.

F. If a county pays for any of these services from general fund appropriations, the county may charge the estate for reasonable compensation. The county treasurer shall deposit monies collected pursuant to this subsection in the same fund from which the expenditure was made.

G. Compensation payable to the department of veterans' services, when acting as a conservator of the estate of a veteran or a veteran's surviving spouse or minor child or the incapacitated spouse of a protected veteran, shall not be more than five percent of the amount of monies received during the period covered by the conservatorship. A copy of the petition and notice of hearing shall be given to the proper officer of the United States department of veterans affairs in the manner provided in the case of any hearing on a guardian's account or any other pleading. A commission or compensation is not allowed on the monies or other assets received from a prior conservator or on the amount received from liquidation of loans or other investments.

#### Section 14-5415. Resignation or substitution of conservator

A. On petition of the protected person or any person interested in the protected person's welfare, or on the court's own initiative, the court shall substitute a conservator and appoint a successor if the substitution is in the best interest of the protected person.  The court does not need to find that the conservator acted inappropriately to find that the substitution is in the protected person's best interest. The conservator and the conservator's attorney may be compensated from the protected person's estate for defending against a petition for substitution only for the amount ordered by the court and on petition by the conservator or the conservator's attorney.  When substituting a conservator and appointing a successor, the court may appoint an individual nominated by the protected person if the person is at least fourteen years of age and has, in the opinion of the court, sufficient mental capacity to make an intelligent choice.  On petition of the conservator, the court may accept a resignation and make any other order that may be appropriate.

B. The protected person may petition the court for an order that the protected person is no longer in need of protection or petition for substitution of the conservator at any time.  A request for this order may be made by informal letter to the court or judge. A person who knowingly interferes with the transmission of this request may be found in contempt of court.

C. An interested person, other than the conservator or protected person, shall not file a petition for adjudication that the protected person is no longer in need of protection earlier than one year after the entry of a protective order unless the court permits the person to file the petition on the basis of affidavits that there is reason to believe that the protected person is no longer in need of protection.

D. An interested person, other than the conservator or protected person, shall not file a petition to substitute a conservator earlier than one year after the entry of a protective order, unless the court permits the person to file the petition on the basis of affidavits that there is reason to believe that the current conservator will endanger the protected person's estate if the conservator is not substituted.

E. Before it orders that need for protection no longer exists, substituting a conservator or accepting the resignation of a conservator, the court, following the same procedures to safeguard the rights of the protected person that apply to a petition for appointment of a conservator, may require appropriate accounts and enter appropriate orders to preserve and protect the assets of the estate, to require reimbursement or payment as needed and to transfer assets or title thereto to appropriate successors.

 

#### Section 14-5416. Petitions for orders subsequent to appointment

A. Within ninety days after appointment, a conservator shall prepare and file with the court an inventory of the assets of the protected person on the date of the conservator's appointment, listing it with reasonable detail and indicating the fair market value of each asset as of the date of appointment.  The conservator shall attach to the inventory a copy of the protected person's consumer credit report from a credit reporting agency that is dated within ninety days before the filing of the inventory.

B. The conservator shall provide a copy of the inventory to the protected person if the protected person can be located, has attained fourteen years of age, and has sufficient mental capacity to understand these matters, and to any parent or guardian with whom the protected person resides.  The conservator shall keep suitable records of the conservator's administration and exhibit the records on request of any interested person.

C. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, a person who is entitled to notice of the conservator's annual account pursuant to section 14-5419, subsection C may request in writing that the conservator do one of the following not more than once every thirty days:

3. Provide a report of receipts and disbursements of the conservatorship.

 

#### Section 14-5419. Accounts; definition

A. Except as provided pursuant to subsection F of this section, every conservator must account to the court for the administration of the estate annually pursuant to rules adopted by the supreme court and on termination of the protected person's minority or disability, except that for good cause shown on the application of an interested person, the court may relieve the conservator of filing annual or other accounts by an order entered in the minutes.

B. The court may take any appropriate action on filing of annual or other accounts. In connection with any account, the court may require a conservator to submit to a physical check of the estate in the conservator's control, to be made in any manner the court may specify.

C. An adjudication allowing an intermediate or final account can be made only on petition, notice and a hearing. Notice must be given to:

1. The protected person.

2. A guardian of the protected person if one has been appointed, unless the same person is serving as both guardian and conservator.

3. If no guardian has been appointed or the same person is serving as both guardian and conservator, a spouse or, if the spouse is the conservator, there is no spouse or the spouse is incapacitated, a parent or an adult child who is not serving as a conservator.

D. An order, made on notice and a hearing, allowing an intermediate account of a conservator, adjudicates as to the conservator's liabilities concerning the matters considered in connection therewith. An order, made on notice and a hearing, allowing a final account adjudicates as to all previously unsettled liabilities of the conservator to the protected person or the protected person's successors relating to the conservatorship.

E. In any case in which the estate consists, in whole or in part, of benefits paid by the United States department of veterans affairs to the conservator or the conservator's predecessor for the benefit of the protected person, the United States department of veterans affairs office that has jurisdiction over the area is entitled to a copy of any account filed under this article.  Each year in which an account is not filed with the court, the conservator, if requested, shall submit an account to the appropriate United States department of veterans affairs office. If an account is not submitted as requested, or if it is found unsatisfactory by the United States department of veterans affairs, the court on receipt of notice of the deficiency shall require the conservator to immediately file an account with the court promptly.

F. Unless prohibited by order of the court, the conservator may file with the court, in lieu of a final account, a verified statement stating that:

1. The protected person has died.  The conservator shall attach a certified copy of the protected person's death certificate to the statement.

2. The protected person's successors have all waived in writing their right to have the conservator submit to the court a final account of the conservator's administration of the protected person's estate. The conservator shall attach the originals of the written waivers to the statement.

3. The conservator has delivered a copy of a closing statement to the protected person's successors.  The conservator shall attach a copy of the closing statement to the statement.

G. The closing statement that is to be delivered to the protected person's successors shall be a verified statement stating the following:

1. The protected person has died and the date of the person's death.

2. The persons receiving the closing statement have a right to have the conservator submit to the court a final account of the conservator's administration of the protected person's estate.

3. If the person wishes to have the final accounting reviewed by the court, the person should not sign a waiver that waives this right.

4. If all persons receiving the closing statement choose to waive the right to have the conservator submit to the court a final account, the final account will not be reviewed by the court.

5. A list of the property owned by the protected person, as of the date of the protected person's death, is attached to the closing statement and that the list states the fair market value of the property as of the date of the protected person's death.

6. The conservator, by the closing statement, shall inform the protected person's successors that if they waive court review of the conservator's final account, the conservatorship will be terminated, the conservator will be discharged from all liabilities relating to the conservatorship, the bond or other security posted by the conservator will be exonerated and any restrictions previously imposed on the assets of the conservatorship will be lifted.

H. The conservator shall file an affidavit with the court that states that the closing statement was sent or delivered to the protected person's successors on a date before the date that the protected person's successors signed the written waiver.

3. If the conservator and the personal representative of the protected person's estate are the same person and if the protected person died testate, the devisees under the protected person's will that has been admitted to probate.

#### Section 14-5420. Conservators; title by appointment

A. The appointment of a conservator vests in the conservator title as trustee to all property or to the part specified in the order of the protected person, presently held or thereafter acquired, including title to any property previously held for the protected person by custodians or attorneys in fact. An order specifying that only part of the property of the protected person vests in the conservator creates a limited conservatorship.

B. The appointment of a conservator is not a transfer or alienation within the meaning of general provisions of any federal or state statute or rule, regulation, insurance policy, pension plan, contract, will or trust instrument, imposing restrictions upon or penalties for transfer or alienation by the protected person of the person's rights or interest.

C. Except as otherwise provided by law, the interest of the protected person in property vested in a conservator is not transferable or assignable by the protected person.

#### Section 14-5421. Recording of conservator's letters

Letters of conservatorship are evidence of transfer of all assets, or in the case of a limited conservatorship, the part specified in the letters, of a protected person to the conservator. An order terminating a conservatorship is evidence of transfer of all assets subject to the conservatorship from the conservator to the protected person, or the person's successors. Subject to the requirements of general statutes governing the filing or recordation of documents of title to land or other property, letters of conservatorship and orders terminating conservatorships shall be filed or recorded in the county where the property of the protected person is located to give record notice of title as between the conservator and the protected person.

#### Section 14-5422. Sale, encumbrance or transaction involving conflict of interest; voidable; exceptions

Any sale or encumbrance to a conservator, his spouse, agent or attorney, or any corporation or trust in which he has a substantial beneficial interest, or any transaction which is affected by a substantial conflict of interest is voidable unless the transaction is approved by the court after notice to interested persons and others as directed by the court.

#### Section 14-5423. Persons dealing with conservators; protection

A. A person who in good faith either assists or deals with a conservator, on the basis of a copy of letters certified by or under the direction of the court or an officer thereof within sixty days of the transaction, is protected as if the conservator properly exercised the conservator's power and even though the authority of that person as conservator has been terminated. The fact that a person knowingly deals with a conservator does not alone require the person to inquire into the existence of a power, the propriety of its exercise, or the current authority of the conservator, except that restrictions on powers of conservators which are endorsed on letters as provided in section 14-5426 are effective as to third persons. A person is not bound to see to the proper application of estate assets paid or delivered to a conservator.

B. The protection expressed in this section extends to any procedural irregularity or jurisdictional defect that occurred in proceedings leading to the issuance of letters. The protection expressed in this section is not a substitution for that provided by comparable provisions of the laws relating to commercial transactions and laws simplifying transfers of securities by fiduciaries.

#### Section 14-5424. Powers of conservator in administration

A. Subject to the limitations provided in section 14-5425, a conservator has all the powers conferred herein and any additional powers conferred by law on trustees in this state. In addition, a conservator of the estate of an unmarried minor, as to whom no one has parental rights, has the duties and powers of a guardian of a minor described in section 14-5209 until the minor attains the age of majority or marries, but the parental rights so conferred on a conservator do not preclude appointment of a guardian as provided by article 2 of this chapter.

B. A conservator, without court authorization or confirmation, may invest and reinvest funds of the estate as would a trustee.

C. A conservator, acting reasonably in efforts to accomplish the purpose of the appointment, may act without court authorization or confirmation to:

1. Collect, hold and retain assets of the estate including land in another state, until, in the conservator's judgment, disposition of the assets should be made. Assets may be retained even though they include an asset in which the conservator is personally interested.

3. Continue or participate in the operation of any business or other enterprise.

4. Acquire an undivided interest in an estate asset in which the conservator, in any fiduciary capacity, holds an undivided interest.

16. Hold a security in the name of a nominee or in other form without disclosure of the conservatorship so that title to the security may pass by delivery, but the conservator is liable for any act of the nominee in connection with the stock so held.

17. Insure the assets of the estate against damage or loss, and the conservator against liability with respect to third persons.

18. Borrow money to be repaid from estate assets or otherwise, advance money for the protection of the estate or the protected person, and for all expenses, losses, and liability sustained in the administration of the estate or because of the holding or ownership of any estate assets, and the conservator has a lien on the estate as against the protected person for advances so made.

19. Pay or contest any claim, settle a claim by or against the estate or the protected person by compromise, arbitration, or otherwise and release, in whole or in part, any claim belonging to the estate to the extent that the claim is uncollectible except that personal injury or wrongful death claims shall be compromised pursuant to subsection D of this section.

20. Pay taxes, assessments, compensation of the conservator and other expenses incurred in the collection, care, administration and protection of the estate.

23. Employ persons, including attorneys, auditors, investment advisors or agents, even though they are associated with the conservator, to advise or assist the conservator in the performance of administrative duties, act upon their recommendation without independent investigation and, instead of acting personally, employ one or more agents to perform any act of administration, whether or not discretionary.

24. Prosecute or defend actions, claims or proceedings in any jurisdiction for the protection of estate assets and of the conservator in the performance of fiduciary duties.

25. Execute and deliver all instruments which will accomplish or facilitate the exercise of the powers vested in the conservator.

D. A conservator may act with court approval to compromise a personal injury or wrongful death claim for a protected person. The conservator may act with court approval to release an alleged tortfeasor if the release is in the best interest of the protected person. If the conservator obtains an order of approval for compromise from a court of competent jurisdiction, the compromise may be in exchange for a lump sum amount or an arrangement that defers the receipt of part or all of the consideration for the compromise until after the protected person reaches majority and may involve a structured settlement or the creation of a trust on the terms that the court approves for any protected person.

#### Section 14-5425. Distributive duties and powers of conservator

A. A conservator may expend or distribute income or principal of the estate without court authorization or confirmation for the support, education, care or benefit of the protected person and the person's dependents in accordance with the following principles:

1. The conservator shall consider recommendations relating to the appropriate standard of support, education and benefit for the protected person made by a parent or guardian, if any. The conservator may not be surcharged for sums paid to persons or organizations actually furnishing support, education or care to the protected person pursuant to the recommendations of a parent or guardian of the protected person unless the conservator knows that the parent or guardian is deriving personal financial benefit from this action, including relief from any personal duty of support, or unless the recommendations are clearly not in the best interests of the protected person.

2. The conservator shall expend or distribute sums reasonably necessary for the support, education, care or benefit of the protected person and the person's dependents with due regard to:

(a) The size of the estate, the probable duration of the conservatorship and the likelihood that the protected person, at some future time, may be fully able to be wholly self-sufficient and able to manage business affairs and the estate.

(b) The accustomed standard of living of the protected person and the person's dependents.

(c) Other funds or sources used for the support of the protected person.

3. With respect to the affairs and estate of a minor, the conservator shall also consider the following factors in making estate distributions:

(a) The financial responsibility and financial resources of the parents of the child.

(b) Extraordinary custodial responsibilities undertaken by the parent or parents as the result of the child's physical or mental condition and the effect of these extraordinary responsibilities on appropriate gainful employment of the parent.

(c) The physical and mental condition of the child and the child's medical and educational needs. Any incidental benefit to other members of the child's household derived from a distribution is not a disqualifying factor.

(d) If the child has a permanent and total disability, the standard of living the child should reasonably expect to enjoy given the financial resources available to the child.

4. The conservator may expend funds of the estate for the support of persons legally dependent on the protected person and others who are members of the protected person's household, who are unable to support themselves and who are in need of support. If benefits are being paid by the United States department of veterans affairs to the conservator, such income may be expended only for the support of the protected person and the person's spouse and minor children, except on petition to and prior order of the court after a hearing.

5. Funds expended under this subsection may be paid by the conservator to any person, including the protected person, to reimburse for expenditures that the conservator might have made, or in advance for services to be rendered to the protected person when it is reasonable to expect that they will be performed and where advance payments are customary or reasonably necessary under the circumstances.

6. A conservator, in discharging the responsibilities conferred by a court order and this section, shall implement the principles described in section 14-5408 to the extent possible.

B. When a minor who has not been adjudged to have a disability under section 14-5401, subsection A, paragraph 2 attains majority, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.

C. When the conservator is satisfied that a protected person's disability, other than minority, has ceased, the conservator, after meeting all prior claims and expenses of administration, shall pay over and distribute all funds and properties to the former protected person as soon as possible.

D. If a protected person dies, the conservator may deliver to the court for safekeeping any will of the deceased protected person that may have come into the conservator's possession or deliver the will to the personal representative named in the will. If the will is delivered to the personal representative named in the will, a copy of the will shall be filed with the court in the conservatorship proceeding. If the will is filed with the court, the conservator shall inform the personal representative or a beneficiary named in the will that the conservator has done so, and retain the estate for delivery to a duly appointed personal representative of the decedent or other persons entitled to the estate. If any of the following situations exist, the conservator may apply to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative so that the conservator may proceed to administer and distribute the decedent's estate without additional or further appointment:

1. Forty days after the death of the protected person another person has not been appointed personal representative and an application or petition for appointment is not before the court.

2. Another person has not been appointed personal representative after the protected person's death, an application or petition for appointment is not before the court and the conservator is the person with priority as determined by a probated will, including a person who is nominated by a power conferred in a will.

3. Another person has not been appointed personal representative after the protected person's death, an application or petition for appointment is not before the court, after the exercise of reasonable diligence the conservator is unaware of any unrevoked testamentary instrument relating to property located in this state and all the heirs of the protected person have nominated the conservator to exercise the powers and duties of a personal representative.

E. The conservator may include in an application made pursuant to subsection D of this section a request to probate the will of the deceased protected person or to adjudicate that the protected person died intestate and to determine the protected person's heirs. On receipt of an application, the registrar, after making the findings required pursuant to section 14-3303, if applicable, shall issue a written statement of informal probate, or a statement of intestacy, and shall endorse the letters of the conservator. The registrar may also enter the will of the deceased protected person to probate.  The statement of the registrar under this section shall have the effect of an order of appointment of a personal representative as provided in section 14-3308 and chapter 3, articles 6 through 10 of this title, except that the estate in the name of the conservator, after administration, may be distributed to the decedent's successors without prior retransfer to the conservator as personal representative.  In exercising the powers and duties of a personal representative after the death of the protected person, the conservator is not required to account for the administration pursuant to section 14-5419 but is subject to the related duties of a personal representative for the administration.

F. If a protected person dies, and on reasonable inquiry the conservator is unable to locate any person specified in section 36-831, subsection A, paragraphs 1 through 11 willing to assume the duty of burying the body of the decedent or making other funeral and disposition arrangements, the conservator may make reasonable burial or other funeral arrangements, the cost of which is a charge against the estate.

G. The estate of a deceased protected person is liable for any unpaid expenses of the conservator's administration, and such expenses are a lien on property transferred by the conservator to the decedent's personal representative.

 

#### Section 14-5426. Enlargement or limitation of powers of conservator

A. Subject to the restrictions in section 14-5408, subsection A, paragraph 4, the court may confer on a conservator at the time of appointment or later, in addition to the powers conferred on him by sections 14-5424 and 14-5425, any power which the court itself could exercise under section 14-5408, subsection A, paragraphs 2 and 3. The court may, at the time of appointment or later, limit the powers of a conservator otherwise conferred by sections 14-5424 and 14-5425, or previously conferred by the court, and may at any time relieve him of any limitation. If the court limits any power conferred on the conservator by section 14-5424 or 14-5425, the limitation shall be endorsed upon his letters of appointment.

B. Upon appointment of a conservator for a protected spouse, the court may determine whether the spouse's share of community property shall be managed by the conservator or by the other spouse. If the court determines that the community property shall be managed by the other spouse, and if the protected spouse is the husband, the wife may become the manager of the community property during the conservatorship and may dispose of community personal property in the interests of the community.

#### Section 14-5427. Preservation of estate plan

In investing the estate, and in selecting assets of the estate for distribution under section 14-5425, subsection A, in utilizing powers of revocation or withdrawal available for the support of the protected person, and exercisable by the conservator or the court, the conservator and the court shall take into account any known estate plan of the protected person known to them, including the will, any revocable trust of which the person is settlor, and any contract, transfer or joint ownership arrangement originated by the protected person with provisions for payment or transfer of benefits or interests at the person's death to another or other persons. The conservator may examine the will of the protected person.

#### Section 14-5428. Claims against protected person; enforcement

A. A conservator must pay from the estate all just claims against the estate and against the protected person arising before or after the conservatorship upon their presentation and allowance. A claim may be presented by either of the following methods:

1. The claimant may deliver or mail to the conservator a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant and the amount claimed.

2. The claimant may file a written statement of the claim, in the form prescribed by rule, with the clerk of the court and deliver or mail a copy of the statement to the conservator. A claim is deemed presented on the first to occur of receipt of the written statement of claim by the conservator, or the filing of the claim with the court. A presented claim is allowed if it is not disallowed by written statement mailed by the conservator to the claimant within ninety days after its presentation. The presentation of a claim tolls any statute of limitation relating to the claim until thirty days after its disallowance.

B. A claimant whose claim has not been paid may petition the court for determination of his claim at any time before it is barred by the applicable statute of limitation and, upon due proof, procure an order for its allowance and payment from the estate. If a proceeding is pending against a protected person at the time of appointment of a conservator or is initiated against the protected person thereafter, the moving party must give notice of the proceeding to the conservator if the outcome is to constitute a claim against the estate.

C. If it appears that the estate in conservatorship is likely to be exhausted before all existing claims are paid, preference is to be given to prior claims for the care, maintenance and education of the protected person or his dependents and existing claims for expenses of administration.

#### Section 14-5429. Personal liability of conservator

A. Unless otherwise provided in the contract, a conservator is not personally liable on a contract properly entered into in the conservator's fiduciary capacity in the course of administration of the estate unless the conservator fails to reveal the representative capacity and identify the estate in the contract.

B. The conservator is individually liable for obligations arising from ownership or control of property of the estate or for torts committed in the course of administration of the estate only if the conservator is personally at fault.

C. Claims based on contracts entered into by a conservator in a fiduciary capacity, on obligations arising from ownership or control of the estate, or on torts committed in the course of administration of the estate may be asserted against the estate by proceeding against the conservator in the conservator's fiduciary capacity, whether or not the conservator is individually liable therefor.

D. Any question of liability between the estate and the conservator individually may be determined in a proceeding for accounting, surcharge or indemnification, or other appropriate proceeding or action.

#### Section 14-5430. Termination of proceeding

A. The protected person, the conservator or any other interested person may petition the court to terminate the conservatorship. A protected person seeking termination is entitled to the same rights and procedures as in an original proceeding for a protective order.

B. The court, on determining after notice and a hearing that the minority or disability of the protected person has ceased, shall terminate the conservatorship unless the court has continued the conservatorship or other protective order pursuant to section 14-5401, subsection B.

C. On termination, title to assets of the estate passes to the formerly protected person or to the person's successors. The order of termination shall provide for expenses of administration and shall direct the conservator to execute appropriate instruments to evidence the transfer.

 

#### Section 14-5431. Payment of debt and delivery of property to foreign conservator without local proceedings

Any person indebted to a protected person, or having possession of property or of an instrument evidencing a debt, stock or chose in action belonging to a protected person may pay or deliver to a conservator, guardian of the estate or other like fiduciary appointed by a court of the state of residence of the protected person, upon being presented with proof of his appointment and an affidavit made by him or on his behalf stating both:

1. That no protective proceeding relating to the protected person is pending in this state.

2. That the foreign conservator is entitled to payment or to receive delivery. If the person to whom the affidavit is presented is not aware of any protective proceeding pending in this state, payment or delivery in response to the demand and affidavit discharges the debtor or possessor.

#### Section 14-5432. Domiciliary foreign conservator; powers of local conservator

If no local conservator has been appointed and no petition in a protective proceeding is pending in this state, a domiciliary foreign conservator may file with a court in this state in a county in which property belonging to the protected person is located certified copies of his appointment and of any official bond he has given. Thereafter, he may exercise as to assets in this state all powers of a local conservator and may maintain actions and proceedings in this state subject to any conditions imposed upon non-resident parties generally.

#### Section 14-5433. Probate fund; use

A. The presiding judge of the superior court in each county may establish a probate fund consisting of monies received pursuant to sections 14-3722, 14-5314 and 14-5414.

B. Each month the clerk of the court shall transmit all monies collected pursuant to sections 14-3722, 14-5314 and 14-5414 to the county treasurer for deposit in the probate fund.

C. The presiding judge of the superior court shall administer or spend monies in the fund to preserve, audit and safeguard the estates and wards for whom the court has a fiduciary responsibility.

D. On notice from the superior court the county treasurer shall invest and divest monies in the probate fund, and monies earned from investment shall be credited to the fund.

E. Fund monies supplement and do not supplant local funding that otherwise is made available for probate services.

 

 

### Article 5 - Powers of Attorney

#### Section 14-5501. Durable power of attorney; creation; validity

A. A durable power of attorney is a written instrument by which a principal designates another person as the principal's agent. The instrument shall contain words that demonstrate the principal's intent that the authority conferred in the durable power of attorney may be exercised:

1. If the principal is subsequently a person with a disability or incapacitated.

2. Regardless of how much time has elapsed, unless the instrument states a definite termination time.

B. The written instrument may demonstrate the principal's intent required by subsection A of this section using either of the following statements or similar language:

1. "This power of attorney is not affected by subsequent disability or incapacity of the principal or lapse of time."

2. "This power of attorney is effective on the disability or incapacity of the principal."

C. A power of attorney executed in another jurisdiction of the United States is valid in this state if the power of attorney was validly executed in the jurisdiction in which it was created.

D. Except as provided in section 28-370, an adult, known as the principal, may designate another adult, known as the agent, to make financial decisions on the principal's behalf by executing a written power of attorney that satisfies all of the following requirements:

1. Contains language that clearly indicates that the principal intends to create a power of attorney and clearly identifies the agent.

2. Is signed or marked by the principal or signed in the principal's name by some other individual in the principal's conscious presence and at the principal's direction.

3. Is witnessed by a person other than the agent, the agent's spouse, the agent's children or the notary public.

4. Is executed and attested by its acknowledgment by the principal and by an affidavit of the witness before a notary public and evidenced by the notary public's certificate, under official seal, in substantially the following form:

I, __________, the principal, sign my name to this power of attorney this _____ day of __________ and, being first duly sworn, do declare to the undersigned authority that I sign and execute this instrument as my power of attorney and that I sign it willingly, or willingly direct another to sign for me, that I execute it as my free and voluntary act for the purposes expressed in the power of attorney and that I am eighteen years of age or older, of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence.

______________________

Principal

I, __________, the witness, sign my name to the foregoing power of attorney being first duly sworn and do declare to the undersigned authority that the principal signs and executes this instrument as the principal's power of attorney and that the principal signs it willingly, or willingly directs another to sign for the principal, and that I, in the presence and hearing of the principal, sign this power of attorney as witness to the principal's signing and that to the best of my knowledge the principal is eighteen years of age or older, of sound mind and under no constraint or undue influence.

(signed) _____________________

______________________________

(notary public)

E. The execution requirements for the creation of a power of attorney provided in subsection D of this section do not apply if the principal creating the power of attorney is:

1. A person other than a natural person.

2. Any person, if the power of attorney to be created is a power coupled with an interest. For the purposes of this paragraph, "power coupled with an interest" means a power that forms a part of a contract and is security for money or for the performance of a valuable act.

F. A person whose license as a fiduciary has been suspended or revoked pursuant to section 14-5651 may not serve as an agent under a power of attorney in any capacity unless the person is related to the principal by blood, adoption or marriage.  This prohibition does not apply if the person's license has been reinstated and is in good standing.

 

#### Section 14-5502. Effect of lapse of time, disability or incapacity

All acts done by an agent pursuant to a durable power of attorney during any period of disability or incapacity of the principal have the same effect and inure to the benefit of and bind the principal and the principal's successors in interest as if the principal were not incapacitated or a person with a disability.

 

#### Section 14-5503. Relation of agent to court appointed fiduciary

A. If, following execution of a durable power of attorney, a court of the principal's domicile appoints any conservator or other fiduciary charged with the management of all of the principal's property or all of the principal's property except for specified exclusions, the agent is accountable to the court appointed fiduciary as well as to the principal. The court appointed fiduciary has the same power to revoke or amend the power of attorney that the principal would have if the principal were not a person with a disability or incapacitated.

B. A principal may nominate, by a durable power of attorney, the conservator or the guardian of the principal for consideration by the court if protective proceedings for the principal or estate are commenced.

#### Section 14-5504. Revocation; termination; effect; notice

A. The death of a principal who has executed a durable power of attorney does not revoke or terminate the agency as to the agent or other person who, without actual knowledge of the death of the principal, acts in good faith under the power. Any action taken in good faith pursuant to this subsection, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds successors in interest of the principal.

B. The disability or incapacity of a principal who has previously executed a written power of attorney that is not a durable power does not revoke or terminate the agency as to the agent or other person who, without actual knowledge of the disability or incapacity of the principal, acts in good faith under the power. Any action taken in good faith pursuant to this subsection, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest.

#### Section 14-5505. Continuance of durable powers of attorney by affidavit

A. An affidavit executed by the agent under a durable power of attorney stating that the agent did not have at the time of exercise of the power actual knowledge of the termination of the power by revocation or of the principal's death creates, in the absence of fraud, a rebuttable presumption of the nonrevocation or nontermination of the power at that time.

B. If the exercise of the power of attorney requires execution and delivery of any instrument that is recordable, the affidavit when authenticated for purposes of recording is also recordable.

C. This section does not affect any provision in a power of attorney for its termination by expiration of time or occurrence of an event other than express revocation or a change in the principal's capacity.

#### Section 14-5506. Powers of attorney; intimidation; deception; definitions

A. If the agent acted with intimidation or deception in procuring the power of attorney or any authority provided in the power of attorney, the agent is subject to prosecution under title 13 and civil penalties pursuant to section 46-456.

B. A power of attorney executed by an adult who does not have capacity is invalid. In a criminal proceeding, the agent has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the principal had capacity. In a civil proceeding, if the party challenging the validity of a power of attorney on the grounds of lack of capacity proves by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time the power of attorney was executed, the principal was a vulnerable adult, the agent has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the principal had capacity. In a civil proceeding, if the party challenging the validity of a power of attorney on the basis of lack of capacity does not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that, at the time the power of attorney was executed, the principal was a vulnerable adult, the agent has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the principal had capacity.

C. A person who in good faith either assists or deals with an agent is protected as if the agent properly exercised the agent's power regardless of whether the authority of that person as the agent has been terminated.

D. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Capacity" means that at the time the power of attorney was executed the principal was capable of understanding in a reasonable manner the nature and effect of the act of executing and granting the power of attorney.

2. "Intimidation" includes threatening to deprive a vulnerable adult of food, nutrition, shelter or necessary medication or medical treatment.

3. "Vulnerable adult" has the same meaning prescribed in section 46-451.

 

#### Section 14-5507. Applicability of article

This article does not apply to health care directives that are validly executed under section 36-3221 and does not establish authority under a durable power of attorney for the purposes of health care decision making.

### Article 6 - Public Fiduciary

#### Section 14-5601. Establishment of office of public fiduciary; appointments; costs

A. Each county board of supervisors, by resolution or ordinance, shall establish the office of and appoint a public fiduciary. The supreme court shall certify each public fiduciary pursuant to section 14-5651.

#### Section 14-5603. Deposit of funds; investment plan

A. All funds coming into the custody of the public fiduciary shall be deposited in the county treasury and disbursed at the direction of the public fiduciary or shall be deposited or invested in one or more insured banks or in one or more insured credit unions authorized to do business in the county or in one or more insured savings and loan associations authorized to do business in the county, and if there are no such insured banks, insured credit unions or insured savings and loan associations in the county, then the public fiduciary may deposit the funds in any insured bank or insured credit union or insured savings and loan association in the state.  Money deposited with the county treasurer or deposited or invested with an insured bank, insured credit union or insured savings and loan association shall be withdrawn only at the direction of the public fiduciary.

B. The public fiduciary may establish or continue an estate or investment plan of the public fiduciary's ward if all of the following apply:

2. The plan is consistent with the standard of care imposed on trustees in sections 14-10804 and 14-10806.

A. The public fiduciary has a claim for all of the following against the estate of the ward, protected person or decedent:

1. Reasonable expenses incurred in the execution of the guardianship, conservatorship or public administration.

2. Compensation for the fiduciary's services and the fiduciary's attorney that the court in which the accounts are settled deems just and reasonable.

3. An annual assessment in lieu of bond of twenty-five dollars and one-fourth of one per cent of the amount of an estate greater than ten thousand dollars.

B. The public fiduciary shall pay all funds received pursuant to this section to the county treasurer for deposit in the county general fund.

#### Section 14-5605. Letter testamentary or of administration not required; statement to be filed; powers and duties

A. Whenever the gross assets of an estate do not exceed in value twenty thousand dollars the public fiduciary may act without the issuance of letters testamentary or of administration by filing with the superior court a statement of administration showing the name and domicile of the decedent, the date and place of death and the name, address and relationship of each known heir or devisee. The filing of this statement has the same effect as the issuance of formal letters testamentary or of administration.

B. In the event the gross assets of an estate in which the public fiduciary commences to act pursuant to a statement of administration later are found to exceed twenty thousand dollars the public fiduciary shall apply for letters for the estate.

C. In the event the public fiduciary, acting in any estate pursuant to subsection A of this section, ascertains the names and whereabouts of persons believed to be heirs or devisees of the estate who are not shown in the statement of administration, the public fiduciary shall file a supplemental statement reflecting the new information.

D. On filing the statement of administration, the public fiduciary may:

1. Take possession of, collect, manage and secure the real and personal property of the decedent.

E. No later than twelve months from the filing of the statement of administration, the public fiduciary shall file with the court an accounting and a proposed distribution and claim for fees if the estate is ready to be settled. If the estate is not ready to be settled the accounting shall contain a statement explaining the delay. The public fiduciary shall file subsequent accountings and explanations on an annual basis until the estate is settled.

F. The public fiduciary shall mail a copy of the accounting, the claim for fees and a proposal for distribution to each person entitled to receive this information including heirs, devisees, known creditors and other persons who have demanded notice. Notification shall be by certified mail. Notice is not required if the public fiduciary cannot reasonably ascertain necessary names and addresses.

G. A decree settling the account and approving the distribution and claim for fees may be entered without further notice or proceedings and with the same effect as in an accounting proceeding unless an objection or claim is properly filed with the court within thirty days after the public fiduciary mails an accounting pursuant to subsection F of this section.

#### Section 14-5606. Additional powers and duties of the public fiduciary

A. If the gross assets of the estate exceed twenty thousand dollars, the public fiduciary may file with the court a verified petition to preserve and protect estate property if action is needed to protect an estate but no probate proceedings have been filed and no affidavit of collection has been tendered pursuant to section 14-3971.

B. The court may grant the petition and enter an order without prior notice and a hearing on a finding of good cause.

D. The superior court shall, and any person may, notify the supreme court if it appears that a fiduciary has violated a rule adopted under this section. The supreme court shall then conduct an investigation and hearing pursuant to its rules. If the supreme court determines that the fiduciary committed the violation it may revoke the fiduciary's license or impose other sanctions, including civil penalties, and shall notify the superior court in each county of this action. The supreme court may then also require the fiduciary to forfeit a cash deposit or surety bond to the extent necessary to compensate the court for the expenses it incurred to conduct the investigation and hearing.

#### Section 14-5652. Attorneys; fiduciary duties

A. Except as prescribed pursuant to section 14-1104 and absent an express agreement to the contrary, the performance by an attorney of legal services for a fiduciary, settlor or testator does not by itself establish a duty in contract or tort or otherwise to any third party.  For the purposes of this subsection, third party does not apply to the personal representative, settlor or testator.

B. An attorney who acts as a personal representative or trustee shall disclose to all adult persons who have an interest in the estate or trust the names of any person who has an interest in that estate or trust to whom the attorney is currently rendering or has in the past rendered legal services.  The attorney must make this disclosure in writing within a reasonable time after learning that a client or former client has an interest in the estate or trust.  The representation of an interested person by that attorney is not grounds for removing the attorney as the personal representative or trustee unless the attorney is unable to perform the fiduciary duties as personal representative or trustee without violating the attorney's ethical responsibilities to the client or former client.

 

### Article 8 - Fiduciary Arrest Warrants

#### Section 14-5701. Fiduciary arrest warrants

A. In an action or proceeding to enforce a court action in a case filed pursuant to this title or title 41, chapter 4, article 1, or on motion by a party or on its own motion, the court may issue a fiduciary arrest warrant if the court finds that all of the following apply to the person for whom the warrant is sought:

1. The person was ordered by the court to appear personally at a specific time and location.

B. When making an arrest pursuant to a fiduciary arrest warrant the arresting officer shall inform the person named in the warrant that the arresting officer has a fiduciary arrest warrant unless:

1. The named person flees or forcibly resists before the arresting officer has an opportunity to inform the named person.

2. Providing this information will imperil the arrest.

C. To execute a fiduciary arrest warrant, the arresting officer may use reasonable force to enter any building in which the person named in the warrant is or is reasonably believed to be.

E. The arrested person shall be brought before the issuing judicial officer as soon as possible or, if that judicial officer is absent or unable to act, before the nearest or most accessible judicial officer of the superior court in the same county.  The arrested person shall be brought before a judicial officer of the superior court in the issuing county or the county of arrest within twenty-four judicial business hours after the execution of the warrant.  If the arrested person is arrested in a county other than the county in which the fiduciary arrest warrant was issued, the arresting officer shall notify the sheriff in the county of issue who shall take custody of and transport the arrested person to the issuing judicial officer as soon as possible.

 

 

#### Section 14-5703. Procedure after arrest; payment for release from custody

A. When a person who is arrested pursuant to a fiduciary arrest warrant is brought before the court, the judicial officer shall advise the arrested person of the nature of the proceedings and shall set a date for the next court appearance.

B. The arrested person may be released from custody pending the hearing if the arrested person pays the amount set by the court or a larger amount as the court determines.  The court may not reduce the amount ordered to be paid.  The arrested person shall not be released from custody without paying the amount unless the court finds in writing or on the record that a compelling reason exists to release the arrested person.

## Chapter 6 - NONPROBATE TRANSFERS

### Article 1 - General Provisions

#### Section 14-6101. Nonprobate transfers on death; nontestamentary nature

A. A provision for a nonprobate transfer on death in any insurance policy, contract of employment, bond, mortgage, promissory note, certificated or uncertificated security, account agreement, custodial agreement, deposit agreement, compensation plan, pension plan, individual retirement plan, employee benefit plan, trust, conveyance, deed of gift, marital property agreement or other written instrument of a similar nature is nontestamentary.

B. A written instrument is nontestamentary if it contains a provision that:

1. Money or other benefits due to, controlled by or owned by a decedent before death shall be paid after the decedent's death to a person whom the decedent designates either in the instrument or in a separate writing, including a will, executed either before or at the same time as the instrument, or later.

2. Money due or to become due under the written instrument ceases to be payable in the event of death of the promisee or the promisor before payment or demand.

3. Any property that is controlled by or owned by the decedent before death and that is the subject of the written instrument passes to a person the decedent designates either in the written instrument or in a separate writing, including a will, executed either before or at the same time as the instrument or later.

C. This section does not limit rights of creditors under other laws of this state.

#### Section 14-6102. Nonprobate transferees; liability for creditor claims and statutory allowances

A. Except as otherwise provided by law, a transferee of a nonprobate transfer is subject to liability to the decedent's probate estate for allowed claims against the decedent's probate estate and statutory allowances to the decedent's spouse and children to the extent the decedent's probate estate is insufficient to satisfy those claims and allowances.  The liability of a nonprobate transferee may not exceed the value of nonprobate transfers received or controlled by that transferee.

B. Nonprobate transferees are liable for the insufficiency described in subsection A of this section in the following order:

1. As provided in the decedent's will or any other governing instrument.

2. To the extent of the value of the nonprobate transfer received or controlled by the trustee of a trust serving as the principal nonprobate instrument in the decedent's estate plan as shown by its designation as devisee of the decedent's residuary estate or by other facts or circumstances.

3. Other nonprobate transferees, in proportion to the values received.

C. Unless otherwise provided by the trust instrument, interests of beneficiaries in all trusts that incur liabilities under this section abate as necessary to satisfy the liability as if all of the trust interments were a single will and the interest were devises under it.

D. A provision made in one instrument may direct the apportionment of the liability among the nonprobate transferees taking under that or any other governing instrument.  If a provision in one instrument conflicts with a provision in another instrument, the later instrument prevails.

E. On due notice to a nonprobate transferee, the liability imposed by this section is enforceable in proceedings in this state, wherever the transferee is located.

F. A proceeding under this section may not be commenced unless the personal representative of the decedent's estate has received from the surviving spouse or a child to the extent that statutory allowances are affected, or from a creditor, a written demand for the proceeding.  If the personal representative declines or fails to commence a proceeding after demand, a person making the demand may commence the proceeding in the name of the decedent's estate, at the expense of the person making the demand and not of the estate.  A personal representative who declines in good faith to commence a requested proceeding incurs no personal liability for declining.

G. A proceeding under this section must be commenced within two years after the decedent's death, but a proceeding on behalf of a creditor whose claim was allowed after proceedings challenging disallowance of the claim may be commenced within sixty days after final allowance of the claims.

H. Unless a written notice asserting that a decedent's probate estate is insufficient to pay allowed claims and statutory allowances have been received from the decedent's personal representative, the following rules apply:

1. Payment or delivery of assets by any financial institution, registrar or other obligor to a nonprobate transferee in accordance with the terms of the governing instrument controlling the transfer releases the obligor from all claims for amounts paid or assets delivered.

2. A trustee receiving or controlling a nonprobate transfer is released from liability under this section on any assets distributed to the trust's beneficiaries.  Each beneficiary to the extent of the distribution received becomes liable for the amount of the trustee's liability attributable to that asset imposed by subsections B and C of this section.

I. For the purposes of this section a nonprobate transfer is a valid transfer effective at death, other than a transfer of a survivorship interest in a joint tenancy of real estate, by a transferor whose last domicile was in this state, and to the extent that the transferor immediately before death had power, acting alone, to prevent the transfer by revocation or withdrawal and to instead use the property for the benefit of the transferor or apply it to discharge claims against the transfer's probate estate.  With respect to multiple party accounts, the portion of the account that is a nonprobate transfer is that portion of that account to which the decedent was beneficially entitled immediately before death pursuant to section 14-6211.

#### Section 14-6103. Notice of death of settlor; filing claim against trust estate

A. After the death of the settlor the trustee of a nontestamentary trust may notify known creditors pursuant to section 14-3801, subsection B and may publish notice to creditors pursuant to section 14-3801, subsection A.

B. A claim against the trust estate that arose before the settlor's death, including claims of the state or any of its political subdivisions, whether due or to become due, absolute or contingent, liquidated or unliquidated, founded on contract, tort or other legal basis, if not barred against the trust estate by any other statute of limitations or nonclaim statute, are barred against the trust estate, the trustee and the beneficiaries of the trust, unless presented within the time prescribed in the written notice for creditors who are given actual notice, or within the time prescribed in the published notice for creditors who are given notice by publication.

C. A claim under this section may be presented as follows:

1. The claimant may deliver or mail to the trustee a written statement of the claim indicating the information prescribed in section 14-3804.

2. If the trustee has distributed the trust estate to beneficiaries of the trust, the trustee shall mail or deliver the claim to any beneficiary that may be liable for the claim because of the receipt of trust assets by that beneficiary.

3. If a claim is presented in a timely manner, section 14-6102 applies.

D. The trustee is not liable to a creditor or to any beneficiary of the trust for giving or failing to give notice under this section.

7. "Pay on death designation" or "POD" means the designation of:

(a) A beneficiary in an account payable on request to one party during the party's lifetime and on the party's death to one or more beneficiaries or to one or more parties during their lifetimes and on the death of all of them to one or more beneficiaries.

(b) A beneficiary in an account in the name of one or more parties as trustee for one or more beneficiaries if the relationship is established by the terms of the account and there is no subject of the trust other than the sums on deposit in the account, whether or not payment to the beneficiary is mentioned.

A. An account may be for a single party or multiple parties. A multiple party account may be with or without a right of survivorship between the parties. Subject to the requirements of section 14-6212, subsection C, either a single party account or a multiple party account may have a pay on death designation or an agency designation, or both.

B. An account established before or after December 31, 1994, whether in the form prescribed in section 14-6204 or in any other form, is either a single party account or a multiple party account, with or without the right of survivorship, and with or without a pay on death designation or designating an agent, within the meaning of this section and is governed by this section.

#### Section 14-6204. Sample forms

A. A contract of deposit that contains provisions in substantially the following form establishes the type of account provided. The account is governed by the requirements of this section that are applicable to that account of that type:

Uniform Single or Multiple Party Account Form

Parties (Name one or more parties):

____________________       _____________________

Ownership                 (Select one and initial):

_____ single party account

Parties own account in proportion to net contributions      unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a

different intent.

_____ single party account with POD

(pay on death) designation

(Name of one or more beneficiaries):

At death of last surviving party, ownership passes to POD (pay on death) beneficiaries and is not part of last surviving party's estate.

_____ multiple party account without right of survivorship

At death of party, deceased party's owner ship passes as part of deceased party's estate.

Agency (power of attorney) designation (optional)

Agents may make account transactions for parties but have no ownership or rights at death unless named as POD (pay on death) beneficiaries.

(To add agency designation to account, name one or more agents):

________________________ _________________________

(Select one and initial):

_____ agency designation survives disability or incapacity of parties

_____ agency designation terminates on disability or incapacity of parties

B. A contract of deposit that does not contain provisions in substantially the form provided in subsection A is governed by the requirements of this article that are applicable to the type of account that most nearly conforms to the depositor's intent.

#### Section 14-6205. Designation of agent; authority; termination

A. By a writing signed by all parties, the parties may designate as an agent for all of the parties on the account a person who is not a party to the account.

B. Unless the terms of an agency designation provide that the authority of the agent terminates on disability or incapacity of a party, the agent's authority survives disability and incapacity. The agent may act for a party with disabilities or incapacitated party until the authority of the agent is terminated. The death of the sole party or last surviving party terminates the authority of an agent.

 

#### Section 14-6206. Beneficial ownership; application and limitation of article

The requirements of this article that relate to beneficial ownership as between parties or as between parties and beneficiaries apply only to controversies between those persons and their creditors and other successors and do not apply to the right of those persons to payment as determined by the terms of the account.

#### Section 14-6211. Ownership of accounts

A. During the lifetime of all parties an account belongs to the parties in proportion to the net contribution of each to the sums on deposit unless there is clear and convincing evidence of a different intent. As between parties married to each other, in the absence of proof otherwise, the net contribution of each is presumed to be an equal amount.

B. A beneficiary in an account having a pay on death designation has no right to sums on deposit during the lifetime of any party.

C. An agent in an account with an agency designation has no beneficial right to sums on deposit.

D. For the purposes of subsection A of this section, "net contribution" means the sum of all deposits to an account made by or for the party, less all payments from the account that are made to or for the party and that have not been paid to or applied to the use of another party and a proportionate share of any charges deducted from the account, plus a proportionate share of any interest or dividends earned, whether or not included in the current balance. Net contribution includes deposit life insurance proceeds added to the account by reason of the death of the party whose net contribution is in question.

#### Section 14-6212. Death of a party; rights of survivors

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, on the death of a party, sums on deposit in a multiple party account belong to the surviving party or parties. If two or more parties survive and one is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under section 14-6211 belongs to the surviving spouse. If two or more parties survive and none is the surviving spouse of the decedent, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under section 14-6211 belongs to the surviving parties in equal shares and augments the proportion to which each survivor, immediately before the decedent's death, was beneficially entitled under section 14-6211. The right of survivorship continues between the surviving parties.

B. In an account with a pay on death designation:

1. On the death of one of two or more parties, the rights in sums on deposit are governed by subsection A of this section.

2. On the death of the sole party or the last survivor of two or more parties, sums on deposit belong to the surviving beneficiary or beneficiaries. If two or more beneficiaries survive, sums on deposit belong to them in equal and undivided shares. Thereafter there is no right of survivorship in the event of death of a beneficiary. If no beneficiary survives sums on deposit belong to the estate of the last surviving party.

C. Sums on deposit in a single party account without a pay on death designation or in a multiple party account that, by the terms of the account, is without right of survivorship, are not affected by the death of a party. However, the amount to which the decedent, immediately before death, was beneficially entitled under section 14-6211 is transferred as part of the decedent's estate. A pay on death designation in a multiple party account without right of survivorship is ineffective. For purposes of this subsection, designation of an account as a tenancy in common establishes that the account is without right of survivorship.

D. The ownership right of a surviving party or beneficiary or of the decedent's estate in sums on deposit is subject to requests for payment made by a party before the party's death, whether paid by the financial institution before or after death or unpaid. The surviving party or beneficiary or the decedent's estate is liable to the payee of an unpaid request for payment. The liability is limited to a proportionate share of the amount transferred under this section to the extent necessary to discharge the request for payment.

#### Section 14-6213. Alteration of rights

A. Rights at death under section 14-6212 are determined by the type of account at the death of a party. The type of account may be altered by written notice given by a party to the financial institution to change the type of account or to stop or vary payment under the terms of the account. The notice shall be signed by a party and received by the financial institution during the party's lifetime.

B. A right of survivorship arising from the express terms of the account, section 14-6212 or a pay on death designation may not be altered by will.

#### Section 14-6214. Accounts; transfers; nontestamentary effect

A transfer of an account pursuant to section 14-6212 is effective by reason of the terms of the account involved and is not testamentary or subject to chapters 1 through 4 of this title.

#### Section 14-6216. Community property; effect of account; right of survivorship

A. A deposit of community property in an account does not alter the community character of the property or community rights in the property.

B. A right of survivorship between parties married to each other arising from the express terms of the account or section 14-6212 may not be altered by will.

#### Section 14-6221. Financial institutions; types of accounts

A. A financial institution may enter into a contract of deposit for a multiple party account to the same extent it may enter into a contract of deposit for a single party account and may provide for a pay on death designation and an agency designation in either a single party account or a multiple party account.

B. A financial institution need not inquire as to the source of a deposit to an account or as to the proposed application of a payment from an account.

#### Section 14-6222. Multiple party accounts; payment; proof of death and survivorship

A financial institution, on request, may pay sums on deposit on a multiple party account to:

1. One or more of the parties, whether or not another party is a party with disabilities, incapacitated or deceased when payment is requested and whether or not the party making the request survives another party.

2. The personal representative, or, if there is none, the heirs or devisees of a deceased party who present an affidavit in compliance with section 14-3971, subsection B and proof of death to the financial institution showing that the deceased party was the survivor of all other persons named on the account either as a party or beneficiary, unless the account is without right of survivorship under section 14-6212.

 

#### Section 14-6223. Pay on death accounts; payment

A financial institution, on request, may pay sums on deposit in an account with a pay on death designation to:

1. One or more of the parties, whether or not another party is a party with disabilities, incapacitated or deceased when the payment is requested and whether or not a party survives another party.

2. The beneficiary or beneficiaries, if proof of death is presented to the financial institution showing that the beneficiary or beneficiaries survived all persons named as parties.

3. The personal representative or, if there is none, the heirs or devisees of a deceased party, if proof of death is presented to the financial institution showing that the deceased party was the survivor of all other persons named on the account either as a party or beneficiary.

 

#### Section 14-6224. Agency accounts; payment to designated agent

A financial institution on request of an agent under an agency designation for an account may pay to the agent sums on deposit in the account, whether or not a party is a party with disabilities, incapacitated or deceased when the request is made or received, and whether or not the authority of the agent terminates on the disability or incapacity of a party.

 

#### Section 14-6225. Payments to minors

If a financial institution is required or permitted to make payment pursuant to this article to a minor designated as a beneficiary, payment may be made pursuant to the uniform transfers to minors act under chapter 7, article 7 of this title.

#### Section 14-6226. Financial institutions; discharge of claims; exception

A. A payment made pursuant to this article in accordance with the type of account discharges the financial institution from all claims for these amounts, whether or not the payment is consistent with the beneficial ownership of the account as between parties or beneficiaries or their successors. Payment may be made whether or not a party, beneficiary or agent has disabilities, is incapacitated or deceased when payment is requested, received or made.

B. Protection under this section does not extend to payments made after a financial institution has received written notice from a party or from the deceased party's personal representative, surviving spouse or heir or devisee if this notice states that payments in accordance with the terms of the account, including one having an agency designation, should not be permitted and the financial institution has had a reasonable opportunity to act on it when the payment is made. Unless the notice is withdrawn by the person giving it, the successor of any deceased party shall concur in a request for payment if the financial institution is to be protected under this section. Unless a financial institution has been served with process in an action or proceeding, no other notice or other information shown to have been available to the financial institution affects its right to protection under this section.

C. A financial institution that receives written notice pursuant to this section or otherwise has reason to believe that a dispute exists as to the rights of the parties may refuse, without liability, to make payments in accordance with the terms of the account.

D. Protection of a financial institution under this section does not affect the rights of parties in disputes between themselves or their successors concerning the beneficial ownership of sums on deposit in accounts or payments made from accounts.

 

#### Section 14-6227. Financial institutions; right to setoff against account

Without qualifying any other statutory right to setoff or lien and subject to any contractual provision, if a party is indebted to a financial institution the financial institution has a right to a setoff against the account. The amount of the account subject to a setoff is the proportion to which the party is, or immediately before death was, beneficially entitled under section 14-6211 or, in the absence of proof of that proportion, an equal share with all parties.

D. The protections of this section do not extend to a reregistration or payment made after a registering entity receives written notice that a claimant to any interest in the security objects to implementation of a registration in beneficiary form. No other notice or other information available to the registering entity affects its right to protection under this section.

E. This section does not affect the rights of beneficiaries in disputes between themselves and other claimants to ownership of the security transferred or its value or proceeds.

#### Section 14-6310. Registrations; terms, conditions and forms

A. A registering entity that offers to accept registrations in beneficiary form may establish the terms and conditions under which it will receive and implement these requests as well as requests for cancellation of previously registered transfer on death beneficiary designations and requests for reregistration to effect a change of beneficiary. The terms and conditions may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death.

B. The registering entity may indicate a beneficiary substitution by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters "LDPS" or the words "lineal descendants per stirpes".

C. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.

#### Section 14-7402. Fiduciary duties; general principles

A. In allocating receipts and disbursements to or between principal and income, and with respect to any matter within the scope of sections 14-7405 through 14-7409, a fiduciary:

1. Shall administer a trust or estate in accordance with the terms of the trust or the will, even if there is a different provision in this article.

2. May administer a trust or estate by the exercise of a discretionary power of administration given to the fiduciary by the terms of the trust or the will, even if the exercise of the power produces a result different from a result required or permitted by this article.

3. Shall administer a trust or estate in accordance with this article if the terms of the trust or the will do not contain a different provision or do not give the fiduciary a discretionary power of administration.

4. Shall add a receipt or charge a disbursement to principal to the extent that the terms of the trust and this article do not provide a rule for allocating the receipt or disbursement to or between principal and income.

B. In exercising the power to adjust under section 14-7403, subsection A or a discretionary power of administration regarding a matter within the scope of this article, whether granted by the terms of a trust, a will or this article, a fiduciary shall administer a trust or estate impartially, based on what is fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries, except to the extent that the terms of the trust or the will clearly manifest an intention that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more of the beneficiaries.  A determination in accordance with this article is presumed to be fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries.

#### Section 14-7403. Trustee's power to adjust

A. A trustee may adjust between principal and income to the extent the trustee considers necessary if the trustee invests and manages trust assets as a prudent investor, the terms of the trust describe the amount that may or must be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's income and the trustee determines, after applying the provisions of section 14-7402, subsection A, that the trustee is unable to comply with section 14-7402, subsection B.

B. In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by subsection A of this section, a trustee shall consider all factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, including the following factors to the extent they are relevant:

1. The nature, purpose and expected duration of the trust.

2. The intent of the settlor.

3. The identity and circumstances of the beneficiaries.

4. The need for liquidity, regularity of income and preservation and appreciation of capital.

5. The assets held in the trust and:

(a) The extent to which:

(i) They consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property or real property.

(ii) An asset is used by a beneficiary.

(b) Whether an asset was purchased by the trustee or received from the settlor.

6. The net amount allocated to income under this article and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available.

7. Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income.

8. The actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation and deflation.

9. The anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment.

10. Whether the trust has been converted to a unitrust pursuant to section 14-11014.

C. A trustee may not make an adjustment:

1. That diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment.

2. That reduces the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion.

3. That changes the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets.

4. From any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of a trust unless both income and principal are so set aside.

5. If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax purposes and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment.

6. If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment.

7. If the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust.

8. If the trustee is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the trustee directly or indirectly.

D. If subsection C, paragraph 5, 6, 7 or 8 of this section applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a cotrustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is not permitted by the terms of the trust.

E. A trustee may release the entire power conferred by subsection A of this section or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in subsection C, paragraph 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 8 of this section, or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection C of this section.  The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual.

F. Terms of a trust that limit the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the trustee the power of adjustment conferred by subsection A of this section.

 

#### Section 14-7404. Judicial control of discretionary powers

A. A court shall not change a fiduciary's decision to exercise or not to exercise a discretionary power conferred by this article unless it determines that the decision was an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.  A court shall not determine that a fiduciary abused its discretion merely because the court would have exercised the discretion in a different manner or would not have exercised the discretion.

B. The decisions to which subsection A of this section applies include:

1. A determination under section 14-7403, subsection A of whether and to what extent an amount should be transferred from principal to income or from income to principal.

2. A determination of the factors that are relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, the extent to which they are relevant and the weight, if any, to be given to the relevant factors in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by section 14-7403, subsection A.

C. If a court determines that a fiduciary has abused its discretion, the remedy is to restore the income and remainder beneficiaries to the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused its discretion as follows:

1. To the extent that the abuse of discretion has not resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary or a distribution that is too small, the court shall require the fiduciary to distribute from the trust to the beneficiary an amount that the court determines will restore the beneficiary, in whole or in part, to that person's appropriate position.

2. To the extent that the abuse of discretion has resulted in a distribution to a beneficiary that is too large, the court shall restore the beneficiaries or the trust, or both, in whole or in part, to their appropriate positions by requiring the fiduciary to withhold an amount from one or more future distributions to the beneficiary who received the distribution that was too large or requiring that beneficiary to return some or all of the distribution to the trust.

3. To the extent that the court is unable, after applying paragraphs 1 and 2 of this subsection, to restore the beneficiaries or the trust, or both, to the positions they would have occupied if the fiduciary had not abused its discretion, the court may require the fiduciary to pay an appropriate amount from its own funds to one or more of the beneficiaries or the trust, or both.

D. On a petition by the fiduciary, the court having jurisdiction over the trust or estate shall determine whether a proposed exercise or nonexercise by the fiduciary of a discretionary power conferred by this article will result in an abuse of the fiduciary's discretion.  If the petition describes the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power and contains sufficient information to inform the beneficiaries of the reasons for the proposal, the facts on which the fiduciary relies and an explanation of how the income and remainder beneficiaries will be affected by the proposed exercise or nonexercise of the power, a beneficiary who challenges the proposed exercise or nonexercise has the burden of establishing that it will result in an abuse of discretion.

 

 

 

 

#### Section 14-7405. Determination and distribution of net income

After a decedent dies, in the case of an estate, or after an income interest in a trust ends, the following apply:

1. A fiduciary of an estate or of a terminating income interest shall determine the amount of net income and net principal receipts received from property specifically given to a beneficiary pursuant to the provisions of sections 14-7407 through 14-7430 that apply to trustees and paragraph 5 of this section.  The fiduciary shall distribute the net income and net principal receipts to the beneficiary who is to receive the specific property.

2. A fiduciary shall determine the remaining net income of a decedent's estate or a terminating income interest pursuant to the provisions of section 14-7407 through 14-7430 that apply to trustees and by:

(a) Including in net income all income from property used to discharge liabilities.

(b) Paying from income or principal, in the fiduciary's discretion, fees of attorneys, accountants and fiduciaries, court costs and other expenses of administration and interest on death taxes, but the fiduciary may pay those expenses from income of property passing to a trust for which the fiduciary claims an estate tax marital or charitable deduction only to the extent that the payment of those expenses from income will not cause the reduction or loss of the deduction.

(c) Paying from principal all other disbursements made or incurred in connection with the settlement of a decedent's estate or the winding up of a terminating income interest, including debts, funeral expenses, disposition of remains, family allowances and death taxes and related penalties that are apportioned to the estate or terminating income interest by the will, the terms of the trust or applicable law.

3. A fiduciary shall distribute to a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount outright the interest or any other amount provided by the will, the terms of the trust or applicable law from net income determined under paragraph 2 of this section or from principal to the extent that net income is insufficient. If a beneficiary is to receive a pecuniary amount outright from a trust after an income interest ends and no interest or other amount is provided for by the terms of the trust or applicable law, the fiduciary shall distribute the interest or other amount to which the beneficiary would be entitled under applicable law if the pecuniary amount were required to be paid under a will.

4. A fiduciary shall distribute the net income remaining after distributions required by paragraph 3 of this section in the manner described in section 14-7406 to all other beneficiaries, including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust.

5. A fiduciary may not reduce principal or income receipts from property described in paragraph 1 of this section because of a payment described in section 14-7425 or 14-7426 to the extent that the will, the terms of the trust or applicable law requires the fiduciary to make the payment from assets other than the property or to the extent that the fiduciary recovers or expects to recover the payment from a third party.  The net income and principal receipts from the property are determined by including all of the amounts the fiduciary receives or pays with respect to the property, whether those amounts accrued or became due before, on or after the date of a decedent's death or an income interest's terminating event, and by making a reasonable provision for amounts that the fiduciary believes the estate or terminating income interest may become obligated to pay after the property is distributed.

 

 

#### Section 14-7406. Distribution to residuary and remainder beneficiaries

A. Each beneficiary described in section 14-7405, paragraph 4 is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in undistributed principal assets, using values as of the distribution date.  If a fiduciary makes more than one distribution of assets to beneficiaries to whom this section applies, each beneficiary, including one who does not receive part of the distribution, is entitled, as of each distribution date, to the net income the fiduciary has received after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date but has not distributed as of the current distribution date.

B. In determining a beneficiary's share of net income, the following apply:

1. The beneficiary is entitled to receive a portion of the net income equal to the beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets immediately before the distribution date, including assets that later may be sold to meet principal obligations.

2. The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated without regard to property specifically given to a beneficiary and property required to pay pecuniary amounts not in trust.

3. The beneficiary's fractional interest in the undistributed principal assets must be calculated on the basis of the aggregate value of those assets as of the distribution date without reducing the value by any unpaid principal obligation.

4. The distribution date for purposes of this section may be the date as of which the fiduciary calculates the value of the assets if that date is reasonably near the date on which assets are actually distributed.

C. If a fiduciary does not distribute all of the collected but undistributed net income to each person as of a distribution date, the fiduciary shall maintain appropriate records showing the interest of each beneficiary in that net income.

D. A fiduciary may apply this section to the extent that the fiduciary considers it appropriate, to net gain or loss realized after the date of death or terminating event or earlier distribution date from the disposition of a principal asset if this section applies to the income from the asset.

#### Section 14-7407. When right to income begins and ends

A. An income beneficiary is entitled to net income from the date on which the income interest begins.  An income interest begins on the date specified in the terms of the trust or, if no date is specified, on the date an asset becomes subject to a trust or successive income interest.

B. An asset becomes subject to a trust on any of the following dates:

1. The date it is transferred to the trust in the case of an asset that is transferred to a trust during the transferor's life.

2. The date of a testator's death in the case of an asset that becomes subject to a trust by reason of a will, even if there is an intervening period of administration of the testator's estate.

3. The date of an individual's death in the case of an asset that is transferred to a fiduciary by a third party because of the individual's death.

C. An asset becomes subject to a successive income interest on the day after the preceding income interest ends, as determined under subsection D, even if there is an intervening period of administration to wind up the preceding income interest.

D. An income interest ends on the day before an income beneficiary dies or another terminating event occurs or on the last day of a period during which there is no beneficiary to whom a trustee may distribute income.

#### Section 14-7408. Apportionment of receipts and disbursements when decedent dies or income interest begins

A. A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement other than one to which section 14-7405, paragraph 1 applies to principal if its due date occurs before a decedent dies in the case of an estate or before an income interest begins in the case of a trust or successive income interest.

B. A trustee shall allocate an income receipt or disbursement to income if its due date occurs on or after the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins and it is a periodic due date.  An income receipt or disbursement must be treated as accruing from day to day if its due date is not periodic or it has no due date.  The portion of the receipt or disbursement accruing before the date on which a decedent dies or an income interest begins must be allocated to principal and the balance must be allocated to income.

C. An item of income or an obligation is due on the date the payer is required to make a payment.  If a payment date is not stated, there is no due date for the purposes of this article.  Distributions to shareholders or other owners from an entity to which section 14-7410 applies are deemed to be due on the date fixed by the entity for determining who is entitled to receive the distribution or, if no date is fixed, on the declaration date for the distribution.  A due date is periodic for receipts or disbursements that must be paid at regular intervals under a lease or an obligation to pay interest or if an entity customarily makes distributions at regular intervals.

#### Section 14-7409. Apportionment when income interest ends; definition

A. When a mandatory income interest ends, the trustee shall pay to a mandatory income beneficiary who survives that date, or the estate of a deceased mandatory income beneficiary whose death causes the interest to end, the beneficiary's share of the undistributed income that is not disposed of under the terms of the trust unless the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than five per cent of the trust immediately before the income interest ends.  In the latter case, the undistributed income from the portion of the trust that may be revoked must be added to principal.

B. When a trustee's obligation to pay a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust's assets ends, the trustee shall prorate the final payment to the extent required by applicable law to accomplish a purpose of the trust or its settlor relating to income, gift, estate or other tax requirements.

C. For the purposes of this section, "undistributed income" means net income received before the date on which an income interest ends and does not include an item of income or expense that is due or accrued or net income that has been added or is required to be added to principal under the terms of the trust.

#### Section 14-7410. Character of receipts; definition

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, a trustee shall allocate to income money received from an entity.

B. A trustee shall allocate the following receipts from an entity to principal:

1. Property other than money.

2. Money received in one distribution or a series of related distributions in exchange for part or all of a trust's interest in the entity.

3. Money received in total or partial liquidation of the entity.

4. Money received from an entity that is a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust if the money distributed is a capital gain dividend for federal income tax purposes.

C. Money is received in partial liquidation either:

1. To the extent that the entity, at or near the time of a distribution, indicates that it is a distribution in partial liquidation.

2. If the total amount of money and property received in a distribution or series of related distributions is greater than twenty per cent of the entity's gross assets, as shown by the entity's year-end financial statements immediately preceding the initial receipt.

D. Money is not received in partial liquidation, nor may it be taken into account under subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section to the extent that it does not exceed the amount of income tax that a trustee or beneficiary must pay on taxable income of the entity that distributes the money.

E. A trustee may rely on a statement made by an entity about the source or character of a distribution if the statement is made at or near the time of distribution by the entity's board of directors or another person or group of persons authorized to exercise powers to pay money or transfer property comparable to those of a corporation's board of directors.

F. For the purposes of this section, "&#61505;entity"&#61504; means any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust fund or other organization in which a trustee has an interest, other than a trust or estate to which section 14-7411 applies, a business or activity to which section 14-7412 applies or an asset-backed security to which section 14-7424 applies.

#### Section 14-7411. Distribution from trust or estate

A trustee shall allocate to income an amount received as a distribution of income from a trust or an estate in which the trust has an interest other than a purchased interest and shall allocate to principal an amount received as a distribution of principal from such a trust or estate.  If a trustee purchases an interest in a trust that is an investment entity or a decedent or donor transfers an interest in such a trust to a trustee, section 14-7410 or 14-7424 applies to a receipt from the trust.

#### Section 14-7412. Business and other activities conducted by trustee

A. If a trustee who conducts a business or other activity determines that it is in the best interest of all of the beneficiaries to account separately for the business or activity instead of accounting for it as part of the trust's general accounting records, the trustee may maintain separate accounting records for its transactions, whether or not its assets are segregated from other trust assets.

B. A trustee who accounts separately for any business or other activity may determine the extent to which its net cash receipts must be retained for working capital, the acquisition or replacement of fixed assets and other reasonably foreseeable needs of the business or activity and the extent to which the remaining net cash receipts are accounted for as principal or income in the trust's general accounting records.  If a trustee sells assets of the business or other activity, other than in the ordinary course of the business or activity, the trustee shall account for the net amount received as principal in the trust's general accounting records to the extent the trustee determines that the amount received is no longer required in the conduct of the business.

C. Activities for which a trustee may maintain separate accounting records include:

1. Retail, manufacturing, service and other traditional business activities.

F. If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal four per cent of the fund's value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period.  If the trustee cannot determine the internal income of the separate fund or the fund's value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under section 7520 of the internal revenue code of 1986, as amended, 26 United States Code section 7520, as amended, for the month preceding the accounting period for which the computation is made.

_______________________________

(Signature)

_______________ (Name of custodian) acknowledges receipt of the property described above as custodian for the minor named above under the Arizona uniform transfers to minors act.

Dated: _______________

____________________________

(Signature of custodian)

C. A transferor shall place the custodian in control of the custodial property as soon as practicable.

#### Section 14-7660. Single custodianship

A transfer may be made only for one minor and only one person may be the custodian. All custodial property held under this article by the same custodian for the benefit of the same minor constitutes a single custodianship.

#### Section 14-7661. Validity and effect of transfer

A. The validity of a transfer made in a manner prescribed in this article is not affected by any of the following:

1. Failure of the transferor to comply with section 14-7659, subsection C concerning possession and control.

2. Designation of an ineligible custodian, except designation of the transferor in the case of property for which the transferor is ineligible to serve as custodian pursuant to section 14-7659, subsection A.

3. Death or incapacity of a person nominated pursuant to section 14-7653 or designated under section 14-7659 as custodian or the disclaimer of the office by that person.

B. A transfer made pursuant to section 14-7659 is irrevocable, and the custodial property is indefeasibly vested in the minor. The custodian has all the rights, powers, duties and authority provided in this article, and neither the minor nor the minor's legal representative has any right, power, duty or authority with respect to the custodial property except as provided in this article.

C. By making a transfer, the transferor incorporates in the disposition all the provisions of this article and grants to the custodian and to any third person dealing with a person designated as custodian the respective powers, rights and immunities provided in this article.

#### Section 14-7662. Care of custodial property; duties of custodian

A. A custodian shall:

1. Take control of custodial property.

2. Register or record title to custodial property if appropriate.

3. Collect, hold, manage, invest and reinvest custodial property.

B. In dealing with custodial property, a custodian shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other statute restricting investments by fiduciaries. If a custodian has a special skill or expertise or is named custodian on the basis of representations of a special skill or expertise, the custodian shall use that skill or expertise. However, a custodian, in the custodian's discretion and without liability to the minor or the minor's estate, may retain any custodial property received from a transferor.

C. A custodian may invest in or pay premiums on life insurance or endowment policies on either the life of the minor if the minor or the minor's estate is the sole beneficiary or the life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest only to the extent that the minor, the minor's estate or the custodian in the capacity of custodian is the irrevocable beneficiary.

D. A custodian at all times shall keep custodial property separate and distinct from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial property of the minor. Custodial property consisting of certificated securities may be held on deposit at a stock brokerage firm or a financial institution registered in a street name or nominee name. Custodial property consisting of an undivided interest is so identified if the minor's interest is held as a tenant in common and is fixed. Custodial property subject to recordation is so identified if it is recorded either by registration or in an account designated, in the name of the custodian, followed in substance by the words, "as a custodian for _______________ (name of minor) under the Arizona uniform transfers to minors act".

E. A custodian shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial property, including information necessary for the preparation of the minor's tax returns, and shall make them available for inspection at reasonable intervals by a parent or legal representative of the minor or by the minor if the minor is at least fourteen years of age.

#### Section 14-7663. Powers of custodian

A. A custodian, acting in a custodial capacity, has all the rights, powers and authority over custodial property that unmarried adult owners have over their own property, but a custodian may exercise those rights, powers and authority in that capacity only.

B. This section does not relieve a custodian from liability for a breach of section 14-7662.

#### Section 14-7664. Use of custodial property

A. A custodian may deliver or pay to the minor or expend for the minor's benefit as much of the custodial property as the custodian considers advisable for the use and benefit of the minor, without court order and without regard to either the duty or ability of the custodian personally or of any other person to support the minor or any other income or property of the minor which may be applicable or available for that purpose.

B. On petition of an interested person or the minor if the minor is at least fourteen years of age, the court may order the custodian to deliver or pay to the minor or expend for the minor's benefit as much of the custodial property as the court considers advisable for the use and benefit of the minor.

C. A delivery, payment or expenditure made pursuant to this section does not affect an obligation of a person to support the minor.

#### Section 14-7665. Custodian's expenses, compensation and bond

A. A custodian is entitled to reimbursement from custodial property for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of the custodian's duties.

B. Except for a person who is a transferor pursuant to section 14-7654, a custodian has a noncumulative election during each calendar year to charge reasonable compensation for services performed during that year.

C. Except as provided in section 14-7668, subsection F, a custodian need not give a bond.

#### Section 14-7666. Exemption of third person from liability

A third person in good faith and without court order may act on the instructions of or otherwise deal with a person purporting to make a transfer or purporting to act in the capacity of a custodian and, in the absence of knowledge, is not responsible for determining:

1. The validity of the purported custodian's designation.

2. The propriety of, or the authority under this article for, any act of the purported custodian.

3. The validity or propriety pursuant to this article of any instrument or instructions executed or given either by the person purporting to make a transfer or by the purported custodian.

4. The propriety of the application of any property of the minor delivered to the purported custodian.

#### Section 14-7667. Liability to third persons

A. A claim based on a contract entered into by a custodian acting in a custodial capacity, an obligation arising from the ownership or control of custodial property or a tort committed during the custodianship may be asserted against the custodial property by proceeding against the custodian in the custodial capacity, whether or not the custodian or the minor is personally liable.

B. A custodian is not personally liable for either:

1. A contract properly entered into in the custodial capacity unless the custodian fails to reveal that capacity and to identify the custodianship in the contract.

2. An obligation arising from control of custodial property or for a tort committed during the custodianship unless the custodian is personally at fault.

C. A minor is not personally liable for an obligation arising from ownership of custodial property or for a tort committed during the custodianship unless the minor is personally at fault.

#### Section 14-7668. Renunciation, resignation, death or removal of custodian; designation of successor

A. A person nominated pursuant to section 14-7653 or designated pursuant to section 14-7659 as custodian may decline to serve by delivering a valid disclaimer to the person who made the nomination or to the transferor or the transferor's legal representative. If the event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred and no substitute custodian who is able, willing and eligible to serve was nominated pursuant to section 14-7653, the person who made the nomination may nominate a substitute custodian pursuant to section 14-7653. Otherwise the transferor or the transferor's legal representative shall designate a substitute custodian at the time of the transfer, in either case from among the persons eligible to serve as custodian for that kind of property pursuant to section 14-7659, subsection A. The custodian so designated has the rights of a successor custodian.

B. A custodian at any time may designate a trust company or an adult other than a transferor pursuant to section 14-7654 as successor custodian by executing and dating an instrument of designation before a subscribing witness other than the successor. If the instrument of designation does not contain or is not accompanied by the resignation of the custodian, the designation of the successor does not take effect until the custodian resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or is removed.

C. A custodian may resign at any time by delivering written notice to the minor if the minor is at least fourteen years of age and to the successor custodian and by delivering the custodial property to the successor custodian.

D. If a custodian is ineligible, dies or becomes incapacitated without having effectively designated a successor and the minor is at least fourteen years of age, the minor may designate as successor custodian, in the manner prescribed in subsection B of this section, an adult member of the minor's family, a conservator of the minor or a trust company. If the minor is under fourteen years of age or fails to act within sixty days after the ineligibility, death or incapacity, the conservator of the minor becomes successor custodian. If the minor has no conservator or the conservator declines to act, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodian, an adult member of the minor's family or any other interested person may petition the court to designate a successor custodian.

E. A custodian who declines to serve pursuant to subsection A of this section or resigns pursuant to subsection C of this section or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodian, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodian. The successor custodian by action may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.

F. A transferor, the legal representative of a transferor, an adult member of the minor's family, a guardian of the person of the minor, the conservator of the minor or the minor if the minor is at least fourteen years of age may petition the court to remove the custodian for cause and to designate a successor custodian other than a transferor pursuant to section 14-7654 or to require the custodian to give appropriate bond.

#### Section 14-7669. Accounting by and determination of liability of custodian

A. A minor who is at least fourteen years of age, the minor's guardian of the person or legal representative, an adult member of the minor's family, a transferor or a transferor's legal representative may petition the court for an accounting by the custodian or the custodian's legal representative or for a determination of responsibility, as between the custodial property and the custodian personally, for claims against the custodial property unless the responsibility has been adjudicated in an action pursuant to section 14-7667 to which the minor or the minor's legal representative was a party.

B. A successor custodian may petition the court for an accounting by the predecessor custodian.

C. The court, in a proceeding under this article or in any other proceeding, may require or permit the custodian or the custodian's legal representative to account.

D. If a custodian is removed pursuant to section 14-7668, subsection F, the court shall require an accounting and order delivery of the custodial property and records to the successor custodian and the execution of all instruments required for transfer of the custodial property.

#### Section 14-7670. Termination of custodianship

The custodian shall transfer in an appropriate manner the custodial property to the minor or the minor's estate on the earlier of:

1. The minor's twenty-first birthday with respect to custodial property transferred pursuant to section 14-7654 or 14-7655.

2. The minor's eighteenth birthday with respect to custodial property transferred pursuant to section 14-7656 or 14-7657.

3. The minor's death.

#### Section 14-7671. Applicability

This article applies to a transfer within the scope of section 14-7652 made after its effective date if either of the following is true:

1. The transfer purports to have been made under the Arizona uniform gifts to minors act.

2. The instrument by which the transfer purports to have been made uses in substance the designation "as custodian under the Arizona uniform gifts to minors act" or "as custodian under the uniform transfers to minors act" of any other state and the application of this article is necessary to validate the transfer.

#### Section 14-9105. Transfer to custodial trustee by fiduciary or obligor; facility of payment

A. Unless otherwise directed by an instrument designating a custodial trustee pursuant to section 14-9103, a person, including a fiduciary other than a custodial trustee, who holds property of or owes a debt to an incapacitated individual not having a conservator may make a transfer to an adult member of the beneficiary's family or to a trust company as custodial trustee for the use and benefit of the incapacitated individual. If the value of the property or the debt exceeds twenty thousand dollars, the transfer is not effective unless authorized by the court.

B. A written acknowledgment of delivery, signed by a custodial trustee, is a sufficient receipt and discharge for property transferred to the custodial trustee pursuant to this section.

 

 

#### Section 14-9106. Multiple beneficiaries; separate custodial trusts; survivorship

A. Beneficial interests in a custodial trust created for multiple beneficiaries are deemed to be separate custodial trusts of equal undivided interests for each beneficiary.  Except in a transfer or declaration for use and benefit of husband and wife, for whom survivorship is presumed, a right of survivorship does not exist unless the instrument creating the custodial trust specifically provides for survivorship or survivorship is required as to community or marital property.

B. Custodial trust property held under this chapter by the same custodial trustee for the use and benefit of the same beneficiary may be administered as a single custodial trust.

C. A custodial trustee of custodial trust property held for more than one beneficiary shall separately account to each beneficiary pursuant to sections 14-9107 and 14-9115 for the administration of the custodial trust.

 

 

#### Section 14-9107. General duties of custodial trustee

A. If appropriate, a custodial trustee shall register or record the instrument vesting title to custodial trust property.

B. If the beneficiary is not incapacitated, a custodial trustee shall follow the directions of the beneficiary in the management, control, investment or retention of the custodial trust property. In the absence of effective contrary direction by the beneficiary while not incapacitated, the custodial trustee shall observe the standard of care that would be observed by a prudent person dealing with property of another and is not limited by any other law restricting investments by fiduciaries, except that a custodial trustee, in the custodial trustee's discretion, may retain any custodial trust property received from the transferor.  If a custodial trustee has a special skill or expertise or is named custodial trustee on the basis of representation of a special skill or expertise, the custodial trustee shall use that skill or expertise.

C. Subject to subsection B, a custodial trustee shall take control of and collect, hold, manage, invest and reinvest custodial trust property.

D. A custodial trustee at all times shall keep custodial trust property of which the custodial trustee has control separate from all other property in a manner sufficient to identify it clearly as custodial trust property of the beneficiary.  Custodial trust property, the title to which is subject to recordation, is so identified if an appropriate instrument so identifying the property is recorded, and custodial trust property subject to registration is so identified if it is registered, or held in an account in the name of the custodial trustee, designated in substance: "as custodial trustee for _______________ (name of beneficiary) under the Uniform Custodial Trust Act pursuant to title 14, chapter 9, Arizona Revised Statutes".

E. A custodial trustee shall keep records of all transactions with respect to custodial trust property, including information necessary for the preparation of tax returns, and shall make the records and information available at reasonable times to the beneficiary or legal representative of the beneficiary.

F. The exercise of a durable power of attorney for an incapacitated beneficiary is not effective to terminate or direct the administration or distribution of a custodial trust.

 

#### Section 14-9108. General powers of custodial trustee

A. A custodial trustee, acting in a fiduciary capacity, has all the rights and powers over custodial trust property that an unmarried adult owner has over individually owned property, but a custodial trustee may exercise those rights and powers in a fiduciary capacity only.

B. This section does not relieve a custodial trustee from liability for a violation of section 14-9107.

 

 

#### Section 14-9109. Use of custodial trust property

A. A custodial trustee shall pay to the beneficiary or expend for the beneficiary's use and benefit as much or all of the custodial trust property as the beneficiary while not incapacitated may direct from time to time.

B. If the beneficiary is incapacitated, the custodial trustee shall expend as much or all of the custodial trust property as the custodial trustee considers advisable for the use and benefit of the beneficiary and individuals who were supported by the beneficiary when the beneficiary became incapacitated or who are legally entitled to support by the beneficiary. Expenditures may be made in the manner, when and to the extent that the custodial trustee determines suitable and proper, without court order and without regard to other support, income or property of the beneficiary.

C. A custodial trustee may establish checking, savings or other similar accounts of reasonable amounts that either the custodial trustee or the beneficiary may withdraw funds from or draw checks against. Funds withdrawn from or checks written against the account by the beneficiary are distributions of custodial trust property by the custodial trustee to the beneficiary.

 

 

#### Section 14-9110. Determination of incapacity; effect

A. The custodial trustee shall administer the custodial trust as for an incapacitated beneficiary if either:

1. The custodial trust was created under section 14-9105.

2. The transferor has so directed in the instrument creating the custodial trust.

3. The custodial trustee has determined that the beneficiary is incapacitated.

B. A custodial trustee may determine that the beneficiary is incapacitated by relying on:

1. Previous direction or authority given by the beneficiary while not incapacitated, including direction or authority pursuant to a durable power of attorney.

2. The certificate of the beneficiary's physician.

3. Other persuasive evidence.

C. If a custodial trustee for an incapacitated beneficiary reasonably concludes that the beneficiary's incapacity has ceased or that circumstances concerning the beneficiary's ability to manage property and business affairs have changed since the creation of a custodial trust directing administration as for an incapacitated beneficiary, the custodial trustee may administer the trust as for a beneficiary who is not incapacitated.

D. On petition of the beneficiary, custodial trustee or other person interested in the custodial trust property or the welfare of the beneficiary, the court shall determine whether the beneficiary is incapacitated.

E. Absent a determination of incapacity of the beneficiary under subsection B or D of this section, a custodial trustee who has reason to believe that the beneficiary is incapacitated shall administer the custodial trust in accordance with the provisions of this chapter applicable to an incapacitated beneficiary.

F. Incapacity of a beneficiary does not terminate:

1. The custodial trust.

2. Any designation of a successor custodial trustee.

3. Rights or powers of the custodial trustee.

4. Any immunities of third persons acting on instructions of the custodial trustee.

 

 

#### Section 14-9111. Exemption of third person from liability

A third person in good faith and without a court order may act on the instructions of or otherwise deal with a person who is purporting to make a transfer as or to act in the capacity of a custodial trustee.  In the absence of knowledge to the contrary, the third person is not responsible for determining:

1. The validity of the purported custodial trustee's designation.

2. The propriety of, or the authority under this chapter for, any action of the purported custodial trustee.

3. The validity or propriety of an instrument executed or instruction given pursuant to this chapter either by the person purporting to make a transfer or declaration or by the purported custodial trustee.

4. The propriety of the application of property vested in the purported custodial trustee.

 

 

#### Section 14-9112. Liability to third person

A. A claim based on a contract entered into by a custodial trustee acting in a fiduciary capacity, an obligation arising from the ownership or control of custodial trust property or a tort committed in the course of administering the custodial trust may be asserted by a third person against the custodial trust property by proceeding against the custodial trustee in a fiduciary capacity, whether or not the custodial trustee or the beneficiary is personally liable.

B. A custodial trustee is not personally liable to a third person:

1. On a contract properly entered into in a fiduciary capacity unless the custodial trustee fails to reveal that capacity or to identify the custodial trust in the contract.

2. For an obligation arising from control of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of the administration of the custodial trust unless the custodial trustee is personally at fault.

C. A beneficiary is not personally liable to a third person for an obligation arising from beneficial ownership of custodial trust property or for a tort committed in the course of administration of the custodial trust unless the beneficiary is personally in possession of the custodial trust property giving rise to the liability or is personally at fault.

D. Subsections B and C do not preclude actions or proceedings to establish liability of the custodial trustee or beneficiary to the extent the person sued is protected as the insured by liability insurance.

 

 

#### Section 14-9113. Declination, resignation, incapacity, death or removal of custodial trustee; designation of successor custodial trustee

A. Before accepting the custodial trust property, a person designated as custodial trustee may decline to serve by notifying the person who made the designation, the transferor or the transferor's legal representative. If an event giving rise to a transfer has not occurred, the substitute custodial trustee designated under section 14-9103 becomes the custodial trustee or, if a substitute custodial trustee has not been designated, the person who made the designation may designate a substitute custodial trustee pursuant to section 14-9103.  In other cases, the transferor or the transferor's legal representative may designate a substitute custodial trustee.

B. A custodial trustee who has accepted the custodial trust property may resign by doing both of the following:

1. Delivering written notice to a successor custodial trustee, if any, the beneficiary and, if the beneficiary is incapacitated, to the beneficiary's conservator, if any.

2. Transferring or registering, or recording an appropriate instrument relating to, the custodial trust property, in the name of, and delivering the records to, the successor custodial trustee identified under subsection C of this section.

C. If a custodial trustee or successor custodial trustee is ineligible, resigns, dies or becomes incapacitated, the successor who is designated under section 14-9102, subsection G or section 14-9103 becomes the custodial trustee.  If there is no effective provision for a successor, the beneficiary, if not incapacitated, may designate a successor custodial trustee.  If the beneficiary is incapacitated or fails to act within ninety days after the ineligibility, resignation, death or incapacity of the custodial trustee, the beneficiary's conservator becomes the successor custodial trustee.  If the beneficiary does not have a conservator or the conservator fails to act, the resigning custodial trustee may designate a successor custodial trustee.

D. If a successor custodial trustee is not designated pursuant to subsection C of this section, the transferor, the legal representative of the transferor or of the custodial trustee, an adult member of the beneficiary's family, the guardian of the beneficiary, a person interested in the custodial trust property or a person interested in the welfare of the beneficiary may petition the court to designate a successor custodial trustee.

E. A custodial trustee who declines to serve or who resigns or the legal representative of a deceased or incapacitated custodial trustee, as soon as practicable, shall put the custodial trust property and records in the possession and control of the successor custodial trustee.  The successor custodial trustee may enforce the obligation to deliver custodial trust property and records and becomes responsible for each item as received.

F. A beneficiary, the beneficiary's conservator, an adult member of the beneficiary's family, a guardian of the person of the beneficiary, a person interested in the custodial trust property or a person interested in the welfare of the beneficiary may petition the court to remove the custodial trustee for cause and designate a successor custodial trustee, to require the custodial trustee to furnish a bond or other security for the faithful performance of fiduciary duties or for other appropriate relief.

 

 

#### Section 14-9114. Expenses, compensation and bond of custodial trustee

Except as otherwise provided in the instrument creating the custodial trust, in an agreement with the beneficiary or by court order, a custodial trustee:

1. Is entitled to reimbursement from custodial trust property for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of fiduciary services.

3. On resignation or removal of the custodial trustee.

4. On termination of the custodial trust.  The statements must be provided to the beneficiary or to the beneficiary's legal representative, if any.  On termination of the beneficiary's interest, the custodial trustee shall furnish a current statement to the person to whom the custodial trust property is to be delivered.

B. A beneficiary, the beneficiary's legal representative, an adult member of the beneficiary's family, a person interested in the custodial trust property or a person interested in the welfare of the beneficiary may petition the court for an accounting by the custodial trustee or the custodial trustee's legal representative.

C. A successor custodial trustee may petition the court for an accounting by a predecessor custodial trustee.

#### Section 14-9116. Limitations of action against custodial trustee

A. Except as provided in subsection C, unless previously barred by adjudication, consent or limitation, a claim for relief against a custodial trustee for accounting or breach of duty is barred as to a beneficiary, a person to whom custodial trust property is to be paid or delivered or the legal representative of an incapacitated or deceased beneficiary or payee who either:

3. The court may apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust by directing that the trust property be applied or distributed in whole or in part in a manner consistent with the settlor's charitable purposes.

B. A provision in the terms of a charitable trust that would result in distribution of the trust property to a noncharitable beneficiary prevails over the power of the court under subsection A to apply cy pres to modify or terminate the trust only if, when the provision takes effect:

1. The trust property is to revert to the settlor and the settlor is still living.

2. Fewer than twenty-one years have elapsed since the date of the trust's creation.

After notice to the qualified beneficiaries, the trustee of a trust that consists of trust property having a total value of less than one hundred thousand dollars or that is uneconomic to administer may terminate the trust if the trustee concludes that the value of the trust property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration.  This subsection does not apply to an interested trustee as defined in section 14-11014.

B. The court may modify or terminate a trust or remove the trustee and appoint a different trustee if it determines that the value of the trust property is insufficient to justify the cost of administration.

C. On termination of a trust under this section, the trustee shall distribute the trust property in a manner consistent with the purposes of the trust.

D. This section does not apply to an easement for conservation or preservation.

 

#### Section 14-10415. Reformation to correct mistakes

A. The court may authorize a creditor or assignee of the beneficiary to reach the beneficiary's interest by attachment of present or future distributions to or for the benefit of the beneficiary or by other means. The court may limit the award to such relief as is appropriate under the circumstances.

B. This section does not apply and a trustee has no liability to any creditor of a beneficiary for any distributions made to or for the benefit of the beneficiary to the extent a beneficiary's interest is protected by a spendthrift provision or is a discretionary trust interest referred to in section 14-10504.

 

#### Section 14-10502. Spendthrift provision

A. A spendthrift provision is valid only if it restrains either voluntary or involuntary transfer of a beneficiary's interest.

B. A term of a trust providing that the interest of a beneficiary is held subject to a spendthrift trust, or words of similar import, is sufficient to restrain both voluntary and involuntary transfer of the beneficiary's interest.

C. A beneficiary may not transfer an interest in a trust in violation of a valid spendthrift provision and, except as otherwise provided in this article, a creditor or assignee of the beneficiary may not attach, garnish, execute on or otherwise reach the interest or a distribution by the trustee before its receipt by the beneficiary.

 

#### Section 14-10503. Exceptions to spendthrift provision; definition

A. Even if a trust contains a spendthrift provision, a beneficiary's child who has a judgment or court order against the beneficiary for support or maintenance, or a judgment creditor who has provided services relating to the protection of a beneficiary's interest in the trust, may obtain from a court an order attaching present or future distributions to or for the benefit of the beneficiary only for these matters.

B. The exception prescribed in subsection A is unenforceable against a special needs trust.

C. A spendthrift provision is unenforceable against a claim of this state or the United States only to the extent a statute of this state or federal law so provides.

D. For the purposes of this section, "child" includes any person for whom an order or judgment for child support has been validly entered in this or another state.

 

#### Section 14-10504. Discretionary trusts; effect of standard; definition

A. Except as provided in subsection B of this section, whether or not a trust contains a spendthrift provision, a creditor of a beneficiary may not compel a distribution that is subject to the trustee's discretion, even if either:

1. The discretion is expressed in the form of a standard of distribution.

2. The trustee has not complied with the applicable standard of distribution or has abused the discretion regarding distributions.

B. To the extent a trustee has not complied with the applicable standard of distribution or has abused the discretion regarding distributions:

1. Except as provided in section 14-10503, a distribution may be ordered by the court to satisfy a judgment or court order against the beneficiary for support or maintenance of the beneficiary's child.

2. The court shall direct the trustee to pay to the child an amount as is equitable under the circumstances but not more than the amount the trustee would have been required to distribute to or for the benefit of the beneficiary had the trustee complied with the standard or not abused the discretion.

C. This section does not limit the right of a beneficiary to maintain a judicial proceeding against a trustee for an abuse of discretion or failure to comply with a standard for distribution, provided that this right may not be exercised by a creditor of the beneficiary or to the extent that any creditor of the beneficiary takes through the name or rights of the beneficiary.

D. Whether or not a trust contains a spendthrift provision:

1. A creditor of a trust beneficiary may not compel a distribution from insurance proceeds payable to the trustee as beneficiary to the extent state law exempts the insurance proceeds from creditors' claims if it had been paid directly to the trust beneficiary.

2. To the extent that under Arizona law life insurance proceeds, policy cash surrender values or other distributions or payments are exempt from attachment or garnishment by, execution on or otherwise the reach of creditors, if the death benefit is payable to an individual beneficiary, the life insurance proceeds, policy cash surrender values or other distributions or payments are also exempt from attachment or garnishment by, execution on or otherwise the reach of creditors if payable to a trust of which a beneficiary is that individual.

E. A creditor of a beneficiary, whether or not the beneficiary is also a trustee or cotrustee, may not reach the beneficiary's beneficial interest or otherwise compel a distribution if either the trustee's discretion to make distributions for the trustee's or beneficiary's own benefit is purely discretionary or is limited by an ascertainable standard, including a standard relating to the beneficiary's health, education, support or maintenance or similar language within the meaning of section 2041(b)(1)(a) of the internal revenue code.

F. For the purposes of this section, "child" includes any person for whom an order or judgment for child support has been entered in this or another state.

 

#### Section 14-10505. Creditor's claim against settlor

A. Whether or not the terms of a trust contain a spendthrift provision, the following rules apply:

1. During the lifetime of the settlor, the property of a revocable trust is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors.  If a trust has more than one settlor or contributor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution. This paragraph does not abrogate otherwise applicable laws relating to community property.

2. Subject to the requirements of this section, with respect to an irrevocable trust, a creditor or assignee of the settlor may reach the maximum amount that can be distributed to or for the settlor's benefit.  If a trust has more than one settlor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution. This paragraph does not apply to any trust from which any distribution to the settlor can be made pursuant to the exercise of a power of appointment held by a third party or abrogate otherwise applicable laws relating to community property.  A creditor of a settlor:

(a) Shall not reach any trust property based on a trustee's, trust protector's or third party's power, whether or not discretionary, to pay or reimburse the settlor for any income tax on trust income or trust principal that is payable by the settlor under the law imposing the tax or to pay the tax directly to any taxing authority.

(b) Is not entitled to any payment or reimbursement that is to be made directly to any taxing authority.

(c) Shall not reach or compel distributions to or for the benefit of the beneficiary of a special needs trust.

3. After the death of a settlor, and subject to the settlor's right to direct the source from which liabilities will be paid, the property of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death is subject to claims of the settlor's creditors, costs of administration of the settlor's estate, the expenses of the settlor's funeral and disposal of remains and statutory allowances to a surviving spouse and children to the extent the settlor's probate estate is inadequate to satisfy those claims, costs, expenses and allowances, except to the extent that state or federal law exempts any property of the trust from these claims, costs, expenses or allowances.  If a trust has more than one settlor or contributor, the amount the creditor or assignee of a particular settlor may reach may not exceed the settlor's interest in the portion of the trust attributable to that settlor's contribution.  This paragraph does not abrogate otherwise applicable laws relating to community property.

B. For the purposes of this section:

1. During the period the power may be exercised, the holder of a power of withdrawal is treated in the same manner as the settlor of a revocable trust to the extent of the property subject to the power.

2. On the lapse, release or waiver of a power of withdrawal, the holder is not, by reason of any such power of withdrawal, treated as the settlor of the trust.

C. For the purposes of this section, a trust settled or established by a corporation, professional corporation, partnership, limited liability company, governmental entity, trust, foundation or other entity is not deemed to be settled or established by its directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, managers, employees, beneficiaries or agents.

D. For the purposes of this section, amounts contributed to a trust by a corporation, professional corporation, partnership, limited liability company, governmental entity, trust, foundation or other entity are not deemed to have been contributed by its directors, officers, shareholders, partners, employees, beneficiaries or agents. Powers, duties or responsibilities granted to or reserved by the settlor pursuant to the trust and any actions or omissions taken pursuant to the trust are deemed to be the powers, responsibilities, duties, actions or omissions of the settlor and not those of its directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, managers, employees, beneficiaries or agents.

E. For the purposes of this section, amounts and property contributed to the following trusts are not deemed to have been contributed by the settlor, and a person who would otherwise be treated as a settlor or a deemed settlor of the following trusts shall not be treated as a settlor:

1. An irrevocable inter vivos marital trust that is treated as qualified terminable interest property under section 2523(f) of the internal revenue code if the settlor is a beneficiary of the trust after the death of the settlor's spouse.

2. An irrevocable inter vivos marital trust that is treated as a general power of appointment trust under section 2523(e) of the internal revenue code if the settlor is a beneficiary of the trust after the death of the settlor's spouse.

3. An irrevocable inter vivos trust for the settlor's spouse if the settlor is a beneficiary of the trust after the death of the settlor's spouse.

4. An irrevocable trust for the benefit of a person, the settlor of which is the person's spouse, regardless of whether or when the person was the settlor of an irrevocable trust for the benefit of that spouse.

5. An irrevocable trust for the benefit of a person to the extent that the property of the trust was subject to a general power of appointment in another person.

F. For the purposes of subsection E, a person is a beneficiary whether so named under the initial trust instrument or through the exercise by that person's spouse or by another person of a limited or general power of appointment.

G. Subsections C and D do not apply to:

1. A trust that has no valid business purpose and that has as its principal purpose the evasion of the claims of the creditors of the persons or entities listed in those subsections.

2. A trust that would be treated as a grantor trust pursuant to sections 671 through 679 of the internal revenue code.  This paragraph does not apply to a qualified subchapter S trust that is treated as a grantor trust solely by application of section 1361(d) of the internal revenue code.

 

#### Section 14-10506. Overdue distribution; definition

A. Whether or not a trust contains a spendthrift provision, a creditor or assignee of a beneficiary may reach a mandatory distribution of income or principal if the trustee has not made the distribution to the beneficiary within a reasonable period after the mandated distribution date unless the terms of the trust expressly authorize the trustee to delay the distribution to protect the beneficiary's interest in the distribution.

B. For the purposes of this section, "mandatory distribution" means a distribution of income or principal that the trustee is required to make to a beneficiary under the terms of the trust, including a distribution amount for a stated age, a distribution to be made pursuant to the exercise of a power of withdrawal and a distribution on termination of the trust. Mandatory distribution does not include a distribution that is subject to the exercise of the trustee's discretion even if:

1. The discretion is expressed in the form of a standard of distribution.

2. The terms of the trust authorizing a distribution couple language of discretion with language of direction.

#### Section 14-10507. Personal obligations of trustee

Trust property is not subject to personal obligations of the trustee, even if the trustee becomes insolvent or bankrupt.

 

 

### Article 6 - Revocable Trusts

1. To the extent the trust consists of community property, the trust may be revoked by either spouse acting alone as to that spouse's share of the community property but may be amended only by joint action of both spouses.

2. To the extent the trust consists of property other than community property, each settlor may revoke or amend the trust with regard the portion of the trust property attributable to that settlor's contribution.

C. The settlor may revoke or amend a revocable trust either:

1. By substantial compliance with a method provided in the terms of the trust.

2. If the terms of the trust do not provide a method or the method provided in the terms is not expressly made exclusive, by either:

(a) A later will or codicil that expressly refers to the trust or specifically devises property that would otherwise have passed according to the terms of the trust.

(b) Any other writing signed by the settlor manifesting clear and convincing evidence of the settlor's intent.

D. On revocation of a revocable trust, the trustee shall deliver the trust property as the settlor directs.

E. A settlor's powers with respect to revocation, amendment or distribution of trust property may be exercised by an agent under a power of attorney only to the extent expressly authorized by the terms of the trust or, if the terms of the trust do not prohibit an agent from exercising powers on behalf of the settlor, to the extent expressly authorized under the power of attorney. If an agent is not so authorized and the terms of the trust do not prohibit a conservator from exercising powers on behalf of a settlor, a settlor's power to revoke, amend or distribute may be exercised by the settlor's conservator with the approval of the court supervising the conservatorship or by the settlor's guardian with the approval of the court supervising the guardianship if an agent is not so authorized and a conservator has not been appointed.

F. A trustee who does not have actual knowledge that a trust has been revoked or amended is not liable to the settlor or settlor's successors in interest for distributions made and other actions taken on the assumption that the trust had not been amended or revoked.

 

 

#### Section 14-10603. Settlor's powers; powers of withdrawal

A. While a trust is revocable by the settlor, the rights of the beneficiaries are subject to the control of, and the duties of the trustee are owed exclusively to, the settlor.

1. One year after the settlor's death.

2. Four months after the trustee sent the person a copy of the trust instrument and a notice informing the person of the trust's existence, of the trustee's name and address and of the time allowed for commencing a proceeding.

B. On the death of the settlor of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death, the trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust.  The trustee is not subject to liability for doing so unless either:

#### Section 14-11011. Interest as general partner

A. Except to the extent that personal liability is imposed in the contract, a trustee who holds an interest as a general partner in a general or limited partnership is not personally liable on a contract entered into by the partnership after the trust's acquisition of the interest if the fiduciary capacity was disclosed in the contract or in a statement previously filed pursuant to the uniform partnership act or the uniform limited partnership act.

B. A trustee who holds an interest as a general partner is not personally liable for torts committed by the partnership or for obligations arising from ownership or control of the interest unless the trustee is personally at fault.

 

#### Section 14-11012. Protection of person dealing with trustee

2. The identity of the settlor.

3. The identity and address of the currently acting trustee.

4. The powers of the trustee.

F. A person who acts in reliance on a certification of trust without actual knowledge that the representations contained in the certification of trust are incorrect is not liable to any person for so acting and may assume without inquiry the existence of the facts contained in the certification of trust.  Actual knowledge of the terms of the trust shall not be inferred solely from the fact that a copy of all or part of the trust instrument is held by the person relying on the certification of trust or by the employees of the person relying on the certification of trust if the person is an entity or organization that conducts activities through employees.

G. A person who in good faith enters into a transaction in reliance on a certification of trust may enforce the transaction against the trust property as if the representations contained in the certification were correct.

H. A person making a demand for the trust instrument or excerpts from the trust instrument in addition to a certification of trust is liable for damages, costs, expenses and attorney fees if the court determines that the person did not act in good faith or did not otherwise comply with subsection E of this section in demanding the trust instrument.

I. This section does not limit the right of a person to obtain a copy of the trust instrument in a judicial proceeding concerning the trust instrument or excerpts from the trust instrument.

#### Section 14-11014. Total return trusts; definitions

A. A trustee, other than an interested trustee, or if two or more persons are acting as trustee, a majority of the trustees who are not an interested trustee, in its sole discretion and without the approval of the court may:

1. Convert an income trust to a total return unitrust.

2. Reconvert a total return unitrust to an income trust.

3. Change the percentage used to calculate the unitrust amount or the method used to determine the fair market value of the trust, or both, if:

(a) The trustee adopts a written policy for the trust providing either:

(i) In the case of a trust being administered as an income trust, future distributions from the trust will be unitrust amounts rather than net income.

(ii) In the case of a trust being administered as a total return unitrust, future distributions from the trust will be net income rather than unitrust amounts.

(iii) That the percentage used to calculate the unitrust amount or the method used to determine the fair market value of the trust, or both, will be changed as stated in the policy.

(b) The trustee sends written notice of its intention to take this action, along with copies of the written policy and this section, to:

(i) The settlor of the trust, if living.

(ii) All qualified beneficiaries of the trust.

(iii) All persons acting as adviser or trust protector of the trust.

(c) At least one person receiving notice under subdivision (b), item (ii) or (iii) of this subsection is legally competent.

(d) No person receiving notice objects to the proposed action of the trustee by submitting a written instrument delivered to the trustee within thirty days after receipt of the notice.

B. If there is no trustee of the trust other than an interested trustee, the interested trustee or, if two or more persons are acting as trustee and are interested trustees, a majority of interested trustees, in its sole discretion and without the approval of the probate court may:

1. Convert an income trust to a total return unitrust.

2. Reconvert a total return unitrust to an income trust.

3. Change the percentage used to calculate the unitrust amount or the method used to determine the fair market value of the trust, or both, if:

(i) In the case of a trust being administered as an income trust, that future distributions from the trust will be unitrust amounts rather than net income.

(ii) In the case of a trust being administered as a total return unitrust, that future distributions from the trust will be net income rather than unitrust amounts.

C. If any trustee wishes to convert an income trust to a total return unitrust, reconvert a total return unitrust to an income trust or change the percentage used to calculate the unitrust amount or the method used to determine the fair market value of the trust, or both, but does not have the ability to or elects not to do it pursuant to subsection A or B of this section, the trustee may petition the probate court for an order as the trustee deems appropriate.  If there is only one trustee of such a trust and that trustee is an interested trustee or if there are two or more trustees of such a trust and a majority of them are interested trustees, the court, in its discretion or on petition of the trustee or trustees or of any person interested in the trust, may appoint a disinterested person who, acting in a fiduciary capacity, shall present information to the court necessary to enable the court to make its determinations.

D. The fair market value of the trust shall be determined at least annually, using a valuation date or dates or averages of valuation dates as are deemed appropriate.  Assets for which a fair market value cannot be readily ascertained shall be valued using valuation methods as are deemed reasonable and appropriate.  Assets used by a trust beneficiary, such as a residence property or tangible personal property, may be excluded from fair market value for computing the unitrust amount.

E. The percentage to be used in determining the unitrust amount shall be a reasonable current return from the trust, but not less than three per cent or more than five per cent, taking into account the intentions of the settlor of the trust as expressed in the governing instrument, the needs of the beneficiaries, general economic conditions, projected current earnings and appreciation for the trust, and projected inflation and its impact on the trust.

F. A trustee may act pursuant to subsection A or B of this section with respect to a trust for which both income and principal have been permanently set aside for charitable purposes under the governing instrument and for which a federal estate or gift tax deduction has been taken, provided that:

1. Instead of sending written notice to the persons described in subsection A, paragraph 3, subdivision (b), item (ii) of this section or pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 3, subdivision (c), item (ii) of this section, as the case may be, the trustee shall send the written notice to the named charity or charities then entitled to receive income of the trust and, if no named charity or charities are entitled to receive all of that income, to the attorney general of this state.

2. Subsection A, paragraph 3, subdivision (c) of this section or subsection B, paragraph 3, subdivision (d) of this section, as the case may be, does not apply to that action.

3. In each taxable year, the trustee must distribute the greater of the unitrust amount and the amount required by section 4942 of the internal revenue code.

G. Following the conversion of an income trust to a total return unitrust, the trustee:

1. Shall consider the unitrust amount as paid from net accounting income determined as if the trust were not a unitrust.

2. Shall then consider the unitrust amount as paid from ordinary income not allocable to net accounting income.

3. After calculating the trust's capital gain net income described in section 1222(9) of the internal revenue code, may consider the unitrust amount as paid from net short-term capital gain described in section 1222(5) of the internal revenue code and then from net long-term capital gain described in section 1222(7) of the internal revenue code.

4. Shall then consider the unitrust amount as coming from the principal of the trust.

H. In administering a total return unitrust, the trustee, in its sole discretion but subject to the provisions of the governing instrument, may determine:

1. The effective date of the conversion.

2. The timing of distributions, including provisions for prorating a distribution for a short year in which a beneficiary's right to payments commences or ceases.

3. Whether distributions are to be made in cash or in kind or partly in cash and partly in kind.

4. If the trust is reconverted to an income trust, the effective date of the reconversion.

5. Any other administrative issues as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section.

I. Conversion to a total return unitrust under this section does not affect any other provision of the governing instrument, if any, regarding distributions of principal.

J. Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, in the case of a trust for which a marital deduction has been taken for federal tax purposes under section 2056 or 2523 of the internal revenue code, the spouse otherwise entitled to receive the net income of the trust has the right, by written instrument delivered to the trustee, to prohibit conversion to a total return unitrust and to compel the reconversion during that spouse's lifetime of the trust from a total return unitrust to an income trust.

K. This section pertains to the administration of a trust and is available to any trust that is administered in this state under Arizona law or to any trust, regardless of its place of administration, whose governing instrument provides that Arizona law governs matters of construction or administration unless:

1. The governing instrument reflects an intention that the current beneficiary or beneficiaries are to receive an amount other than a reasonable current return from the trust.

2. The trust is a pooled income fund described in section 642(c)(5) of the internal revenue code or a charitable remainder annuity trust described in section 664(d) of the internal revenue code.

3. The governing instrument expressly prohibits use of this section by specific reference to this section or expressly states the settlor's intent that net income not be calculated as a unitrust amount.  A provision in the governing instrument that "the provisions of Arizona Revised Statutes, section 14-11014, as amended, or any corresponding provision of future law, shall not be used in the administration of this trust" or "my trustee shall not determine the distributions to the income beneficiary as a unitrust amount" or similar words reflecting such intent shall be sufficient to preclude the use of this section.

L. Any trustee or disinterested person who in good faith takes or fails to take any action under this section is not liable to any person affected by that action or inaction, regardless of whether the person received written notice as prescribed in this section and regardless of whether the person was under a legal disability at the time of the delivery of the notice.  The person's exclusive remedy is to obtain a court order directing the trustee to convert an income trust to a total return unitrust, to reconvert from a total return unitrust to an income trust or to change the percentage used to calculate the unitrust amount.

M. This section is available to trusts in existence on October 1, 2008 or created after that date.

N. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Disinterested person" means a person who is not a related or subordinate party pursuant to section 672(c) of the internal revenue code with respect to the person then acting as trustee of the trust and excludes the settlor of the trust and any interested trustee.

2. "Income trust" means a trust that is created by either an inter vivos or a testamentary instrument and that directs or permits the trustee to distribute the net income of the trust to one or more persons, either in required amounts or proportions, or in amounts or proportions determined by the trustee and regardless of whether the trust directs or permits the trustee to distribute the principal of the trust to one or more of these persons.

3. "Interested distributee" means a person to whom distributions of income or principal can currently be made who has the power to remove the existing trustee and designate as successor a person who may be a related or subordinate party pursuant to section 672(c) of the internal revenue code with respect to that distributee.

4. "Interested trustee" means:

(a) An individual trustee to whom the net income or principal of the trust can currently be distributed or would be distributed if the trust were then to terminate and be distributed.

(b) Any trustee who may be removed and replaced by an interested distributee.

(c) An individual trustee whose legal obligation to support a beneficiary may be satisfied by distributions of income and principal of the trust.

5. "Total return unitrust" means an income trust that has been converted under and meets the requirements of this section.

6. "Trustee" means any person acting as trustee of the trust, unless expressly noted otherwise, whether acting in that person's discretion or on the direction of one or more persons acting in a fiduciary capacity.

7. "Unitrust amount" means an amount computed as a percentage of the fair market value of the trust.

 

#### Section 14-11015. Express total return unitrusts; definition

A. A unitrust amount may be determined by reference to the net fair market value of the trust's assets in one year or more than one year.

B. Distribution of a fixed percentage unitrust amount is considered a distribution of all of the income of the total return unitrust and is not a fundamental departure from applicable state law, regardless of whether the total return unitrust is created and governed pursuant to section 14-11014 or by the terms of the governing instrument.

C. An express total return unitrust may provide a mechanism for changing the unitrust percentage similar to the mechanism provided under section 14-11014 based on the factors prescribed in that section and may provide for a change from a unitrust to an income trust similar to the mechanism prescribed pursuant to section 14-11014.

D. If an express total return unitrust does not specifically or by reference to section 14-11014 grant a power to change the unitrust percentage or change to an income trust, the trustee shall have no such power.

E. A distribution of the fixed percentage of not less than three per cent nor more than five per cent reasonably apportions the total return of a total return unitrust.

F. An express total return unitrust that provides for a fixed percentage payout in excess of five per cent per year is considered to have paid out all of the income of the total return unitrust and to have paid out principal of the trust to the extent that the fixed percentage payout exceeds five per cent per year.

G. The trust document may grant discretion to the trustee to adopt a consistent practice of treating capital gains as part of the unitrust distribution, to the extent that the unitrust distribution exceeds the net accounting income, or it may specify the ordering of these classes of income.

H. Unless the terms of the trust specifically provide otherwise, a distribution of the unitrust amount is considered to have been made from the following sources in order of priority:

1. From net accounting income determined as if the trust were not a unitrust.

2. From ordinary income not allocable to net accounting income.

3. From net realized short-term capital gains.

4. From net realized long-term capital gains.

5. From the principal of the trust estate.

I. The trust document may provide that assets used by the trust beneficiary, such as a residence property or tangible personal property, may be excluded from the net fair market value for computing the unitrust amount. This use may be considered equivalent to the income or unitrust amount.

J. For the purposes of this section, "express total return unitrust" means a trust that by its governing instrument requires the distribution at least annually of a unitrust amount equal to a fixed percentage of not less than three nor more than five per cent per year of the net fair market value of the trust's assets, valued at least annually.

3. Continue to exercise jurisdiction after considering:

(a) The extent to which the respondent and all persons required to be notified of the proceedings have acquiesced in the exercise of the court's jurisdiction.
