# Title 13 - Criminal Code

## Chapter 1 - GENERAL PROVISIONS

###    -

#### Section 13-101. Purposes

It is declared that the public policy of this state and the general purposes of the provisions of this title are:

1. To proscribe conduct that unjustifiably and inexcusably causes or threatens substantial harm to individual or public interests;

2. To give fair warning of the nature of the conduct proscribed and of the sentences authorized upon conviction;

3. To define the act or omission and the accompanying mental state which constitute each offense and limit the condemnation of conduct as criminal when it does not fall within the purposes set forth;

4. To differentiate on reasonable grounds between serious and minor offenses and to prescribe proportionate penalties for each;

5. To insure the public safety by preventing the commission of offenses through the deterrent influence of the sentences authorized;

6. To impose just and deserved punishment on those whose conduct threatens the public peace; and

7. To promote truth and accountability in sentencing.

#### Section 13-101.01. Additional purposes of the criminal law

In order to preserve and protect the rights of crime victims to justice and the right of the people to safety, it is a fundamental purpose of the criminal law to identify and remove from society persons whose conduct continues to threaten public safety through the commission of violent or aggravated felonies after having been convicted twice previously of violent or aggravated felony offenses.

#### Section 13-103. Abolition of common law offenses and affirmative defenses; definition

#### Section 13-111. Former jeopardy or acquittal as bar to same or lesser offenses

When the defendant is convicted or acquitted, or has once been placed in jeopardy upon an indictment or information, the conviction, acquittal or jeopardy is a bar to another indictment or information for the offense charged in either, or for an attempt to commit the offense, or for any offense necessarily included therein, of which he might have been convicted under the indictment or information.

## Chapter 2 - GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF CRIMINAL LIABILITY

###    -

#### Section 13-201. Requirements for criminal liability

The minimum requirement for criminal liability is the performance by a person of conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform a duty imposed by law which the person is physically capable of performing.

#### Section 13-202. Construction of statutes with respect to culpability

A. If a statute defining an offense prescribes a culpable mental state that is sufficient for commission of the offense without distinguishing among the elements of such offense, the prescribed mental state shall apply to each such element unless a contrary legislative purpose plainly appears.

B. If a statute defining an offense does not expressly prescribe a culpable mental state that is sufficient for commission of the offense, no culpable mental state is required for the commission of such offense, and the offense is one of strict liability unless the proscribed conduct necessarily involves a culpable mental state. If the offense is one of strict liability, proof of a culpable mental state will also suffice to establish criminal responsibility.

C. If a statute provides that criminal negligence suffices to establish an element of an offense, that element also is established if a person acts intentionally, knowingly or recklessly. If acting recklessly suffices to establish an element, that element also is established if a person acts intentionally or knowingly. If acting knowingly suffices to establish an element, that element is also established if a person acts intentionally.

#### Section 13-203. Causal relationship between conduct and result; relationship to mental culpability

A. Conduct is the cause of a result when both of the following exist:

1. But for the conduct the result in question would not have occurred.

2. The relationship between the conduct and result satisfies any additional causal requirements imposed by the statute defining the offense.

B. If intentionally causing a particular result is an element of an offense, and the actual result is not within the intention or contemplation of the person, that element is established if:

1. The actual result differs from that intended or contemplated only in the respect that a different person or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm intended or contemplated would have been more serious or extensive than that caused; or

2. The actual result involves similar injury or harm as that intended or contemplated and occurs in a manner which the person knows or should know is rendered substantially more probable by such person's conduct.

C. If recklessly or negligently causing a particular result is an element of an offense, and the actual result is not within the risk of which the person is aware or in the case of criminal negligence, of which the person should be aware, that element is established if:

1. The actual result differs from the probable result only in the respect that a different person or different property is injured or affected or that the injury or harm intended or contemplated would have been more serious or extensive than that caused; or

2. The actual result involves similar injury or harm as the probable result and occurs in a manner which the person knows or should know is rendered substantially more probable by such person's conduct.

#### Section 13-204. Effect of ignorance or mistake upon criminal liability

A. Ignorance or a mistaken belief as to a matter of fact does not relieve a person of criminal liability unless:

1. It negates the culpable mental state required for commission of the offense; or

2. It supports a defense of justification as defined in chapter 4 of this title.

B. Ignorance or mistake as to a matter of law does not relieve a person of criminal responsibility.

#### Section 13-205. Affirmative defenses; justification; burden of proof

A. Except as otherwise provided by law, a defendant shall prove any affirmative defense raised by a preponderance of the evidence. Justification defenses under chapter 4 of this title are not affirmative defenses. Justification defenses describe conduct that, if not justified, would constitute an offense but, if justified, does not constitute criminal or wrongful conduct.  If evidence of justification pursuant to chapter 4 of this title is presented by the defendant, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act with justification.

B. This section does not affect the presumption contained in section 13-411, subsection C and section 13-503.

 

#### Section 13-206. Entrapment

A. It is an affirmative defense to a criminal charge that the person was entrapped. To claim entrapment, the person must admit by the person's testimony or other evidence the substantial elements of the offense charged.

B. A person who asserts an entrapment defense has the burden of proving the following by clear and convincing evidence:

1. The idea of committing the offense started with law enforcement officers or their agents rather than with the person.

2. The law enforcement officers or their agents urged and induced the person to commit the offense.

3. The person was not predisposed to commit the type of offense charged before the law enforcement officers or their agents urged and induced the person to commit the offense.

C. A person does not establish entrapment if the person was predisposed to commit the offense and the law enforcement officers or their agents merely provided the person with an opportunity to commit the offense. It is not entrapment for law enforcement officers or their agents merely to use a ruse or to conceal their identity. The conduct of law enforcement officers and their agents may be considered in determining if a person has proven entrapment.

## Chapter 3 - PARTIES TO OFFENSES: ACCOUNTABILITY

###    -

#### Section 13-301. Definition of accomplice

In this title, unless the context otherwise requires, "accomplice" means a person, other than a peace officer acting in his official capacity within the scope of his authority and in the line of duty, who with the intent to promote or facilitate the commission of an offense:

1. Solicits or commands another person to commit the offense; or

2. Aids, counsels, agrees to aid or attempts to aid another person in planning or committing an offense.

3. Provides means or opportunity to another person to commit the offense.

 

#### Section 13-302. Criminal liability based upon conduct

A person may be guilty of an offense committed by such person's own conduct or by the conduct of another for which such person is criminally accountable as provided in this chapter, or both.  In any prosecution, testimony of an accomplice need not be corroborated.

#### Section 13-303. Criminal liability based upon conduct of another

A. A person is criminally accountable for the conduct of another if:

1. The person is made accountable for such conduct by the statute defining the offense; or

2. Acting with the culpable mental state sufficient for the commission of the offense, such person causes another person, whether or not such other person is capable of forming the culpable mental state, to engage in such conduct; or

3. The person is an accomplice of such other person in the commission of an offense including any offense that is a natural and probable or reasonably foreseeable consequence of the offense for which the person was an accomplice.

B. If causing a particular result is an element of an offense, a person who acts with the kind of culpability with respect to the result that is sufficient for the commission of the offense is guilty of that offense if:

1. The person solicits or commands another person to engage in the conduct causing such result; or

2. The person aids, counsels, agrees to aid or attempts to aid another person in planning or engaging in the conduct causing such result.

A. A person may be found guilty except insane if at the time of the commission of the criminal act the person was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that the person did not know the criminal act was wrong. A mental disease or defect constituting legal insanity is an affirmative defense. Mental disease or defect does not include disorders that result from acute voluntary intoxication or withdrawal from alcohol or drugs, character defects, psychosexual disorders or impulse control disorders.  Conditions that do not constitute legal insanity include momentary, temporary conditions arising from the pressure of the circumstances, moral decadence, depravity or passion growing out of anger, jealousy, revenge, hatred or other motives in a person who does not suffer from a mental disease or defect or an abnormality that is manifested only by criminal conduct.

B. In a case involving the death or serious physical injury of or the threat of death or serious physical injury to another person, if a plea of insanity is made and the court determines that a reasonable basis exists to support the plea, the court may commit the defendant to a secure state mental health facility under the department of health services, a secure county mental health evaluation and treatment facility or another secure licensed mental health facility for up to thirty days for mental health evaluation and treatment. Experts at the mental health facility who are licensed pursuant to title 32, who are familiar with this state's insanity statutes, who are specialists in mental diseases and defects and who are knowledgeable concerning insanity shall observe and evaluate the defendant. The expert or experts who examine the defendant shall submit a written report of the evaluation to the court, the defendant's attorney and the prosecutor. The court shall order the defendant to pay the costs of the mental health facility to the clerk of the court. The clerk of the court shall transmit the reimbursements to the mental health facility for all of its costs. If the court finds the defendant is indigent or otherwise is unable to pay all or any of the costs, the court shall order the county to reimburse the mental health facility for the remainder of the costs. Notwithstanding section 36-545.02, the mental health facility may maintain the reimbursements. If the court does not commit the defendant to a secure state mental health facility, a secure county mental health evaluation and treatment facility or another secure licensed mental health facility, the court shall appoint an independent expert who is licensed pursuant to title 32, who is familiar with this state's insanity statutes, who is a specialist in mental diseases and defects and who is knowledgeable concerning insanity to observe and evaluate the defendant. The expert who examines the defendant shall submit a written report of the evaluation to the court, the defendant's attorney and the prosecutor.  The court shall order the defendant to pay the costs of the services of the independent expert to the clerk of the court. The clerk of the court shall transmit the reimbursements to the expert. If the court finds the defendant is indigent or otherwise unable to pay all or any of the costs, the court shall order the county to reimburse the expert for the remainder of the costs. This subsection does not prohibit the defendant or this state from obtaining additional psychiatric examinations by other mental health experts who are licensed pursuant to title 32, who are familiar with this state's insanity statutes, who are specialists in mental diseases and defects and who are knowledgeable concerning insanity.

C. The defendant shall prove the defendant's legal insanity by clear and convincing evidence.

D. If the finder of fact finds the defendant guilty except insane, the court shall determine the sentence the defendant could have received pursuant to section 13-707 or section 13-751, subsection A or the presumptive sentence the defendant could have received pursuant to section 13-702, section 13-703, section 13-704, section 13-705, section 13-706, subsection A, section 13-710 or section 13-1406 if the defendant had not been found insane, and the judge shall suspend the sentence and shall order the defendant to be placed and remain under the jurisdiction of the superior court and committed to a secure state mental health facility under the department of health services pursuant to section 13-3992 for the length of that sentence. In making this determination the court shall not consider the sentence enhancements for prior convictions under section 13-703 or 13-704. The court shall expressly identify each act that the defendant committed and separately find whether each act involved the death or physical injury of or a substantial threat of death or physical injury to another person.

E. A guilty except insane verdict is not a criminal conviction for sentencing enhancement purposes under section 13-703 or 13-704.

#### Section 13-503. Effect of alcohol or drug use

Temporary intoxication resulting from the voluntary ingestion, consumption, inhalation or injection of alcohol, an illegal substance under chapter 34 of this title or other psychoactive substances or the abuse of prescribed medications does not constitute insanity and is not a defense for any criminal act or requisite state of mind.

#### Section 13-504. Persons under eighteen years of age; juvenile transfer

A. On the motion of a juvenile or on the court's own motion, the court, if a juvenile is being prosecuted in the same manner as an adult pursuant to section 13-501, subsection B, shall hold a hearing to determine if jurisdiction of the criminal prosecution should be transferred to the juvenile court.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the court shall hold a hearing if a juvenile is prosecuted in the same manner as an adult pursuant to section 13-501, subsection B for an offense that was committed more than twelve months before the date of the filing of the criminal charge.

C. If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that public safety and the rehabilitation of the juvenile, if adjudicated delinquent, would be best served by transferring the prosecution to the juvenile court, the judge shall order the juvenile transferred to the juvenile court.  On transfer, the court shall order that the juvenile be taken to a place of detention designated by the juvenile court or to that court or shall release the juvenile to the custody of the juvenile's parent or guardian or other person legally responsible for the juvenile. If the juvenile is released to the juvenile's parent or guardian or other person legally responsible for the juvenile, the court shall require that the parent, guardian or other person bring the juvenile to appear before the juvenile court at a designated time. The juvenile court shall then proceed with all further proceedings as if a petition alleging delinquency had been filed with the juvenile court under section 8-301.

D. The court shall consider the following factors in determining whether public safety and the juvenile's rehabilitation, if adjudicated delinquent, would be served by the transfer:

1. The seriousness of the offense involved.

2. The record and previous history of the juvenile, including previous contacts with the court and law enforcement, previous periods of any court ordered probation and the results of that probation.

3. Any previous commitments of the juvenile to juvenile residential placements or other secure institutions.

4. Whether the juvenile was previously committed to the department of juvenile corrections for a felony offense.

5. Whether the juvenile committed another felony offense while the juvenile was a ward of the department of juvenile corrections.

6. Whether the juvenile committed the alleged offense while participating in, assisting, promoting or furthering the interests of a criminal street gang, a criminal syndicate or a racketeering enterprise.

7. The views of the victim of the offense.

8. Whether the degree of the juvenile's participation in the offense was relatively minor but not so minor as to constitute a defense to prosecution.

9. The juvenile's mental and emotional condition.

10. The likelihood of the juvenile's reasonable rehabilitation through the use of services and facilities that are currently available to the juvenile court.

E. At the conclusion of the transfer hearing, the court shall make a written determination whether the juvenile should be transferred to juvenile court. The court shall not defer the decision as to the transfer.

D. If a crime or public offense is punishable in the discretion of the court by a sentence as a class 6 felony or a class 1 misdemeanor, the offense shall be deemed a misdemeanor if the prosecuting attorney files any of the following:

1. An information in superior court designating the offense as a misdemeanor.

2. A complaint in justice court or municipal court designating the offense as a misdemeanor within the jurisdiction of the respective court.

3. A complaint, with the consent of the defendant, before or during the preliminary hearing amending the complaint to charge a misdemeanor.

#### Section 13-606. Civil commitment after imposition of sentence

A. If, after imposition of sentence authorized by section 13-603 and on the basis of the report and recommendations submitted to the court under subsection B of section 13-605, the court believes that the defendant discloses symptoms of mental disorder, the court may proceed as provided in chapter 5 of title 36.

#### Section 13-712. Calculation of terms of imprisonment

 

(L08, Ch. 301, sec. 27.  Eff. until 1/1/24)

The interruption continues until the person is apprehended and confined for the escape or is confined and subject to a detainer for the escape. Time spent in actual custody prior to return under this subsection shall be credited against the term authorized by law if custody rested on an arrest or surrender for the escape itself, or if the custody arose from an arrest on another charge which culminated in a dismissal or an acquittal, and the person was denied admission to bail pending disposition of that charge because of a warrant lodged against such person arising from the escape.

E. The sentencing court shall include the time of commencement of sentence under subsection A and the computation of time credited against sentence under subsection B, C or D, in the original or an amended commitment order, under procedures established by rule of court.

C. If a sentence of imprisonment is vacated and a new sentence is imposed on the defendant for the same offense, the new sentence is calculated as if it had commenced at the time the vacated sentence was imposed, and all time served under the vacated sentence shall be credited against the new sentence.

D. If a person serving a sentence of imprisonment escapes from custody, the escape interrupts the sentence. The interruption continues until the person is apprehended and confined for the escape or is confined and subject to a detainer for the escape. Time spent in actual custody before return under this subsection shall be credited against the term authorized by law if custody rested on an arrest or surrender for the escape itself, or if the custody arose from an arrest on another charge which culminated in a dismissal or an acquittal, and the person was denied admission to bail pending disposition of that charge because of a warrant lodged against such person arising from the escape.

E. The sentencing court shall include the time of commencement of sentence under subsection A of this section and the computation of time credited against sentence under subsection B, C or D of this section in the original or an amended commitment order, under procedures established by rule of court.

1. The defendant's capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was significantly impaired, but not so impaired as to constitute a defense to prosecution.

2. The defendant was under unusual and substantial duress, although not such as to constitute a defense to prosecution.

3. The defendant was legally accountable for the conduct of another under section 13-303, but his participation was relatively minor, although not so minor as to constitute a defense to prosecution.

#### Section 13-752. Sentences of death, life imprisonment or natural life; imposition; sentencing proceedings; definitions

A. If the state has filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty and the defendant is convicted of first degree murder, the trier of fact at the sentencing proceeding shall determine whether to impose a sentence of death in accordance with the procedures provided in this section.  If the trier of fact determines that a sentence of death is not appropriate, or if the state has not filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, and the defendant is convicted of first degree murder pursuant to section 13-1105, subsection A, paragraph 1 or 3 and was at least eighteen years of age at the time of the commission of the offense, the court shall impose a sentence of natural life.  If the defendant was under eighteen years of age at the time of the commission of the offense or if the defendant is convicted of first degree murder pursuant to section 13-1105, subsection A, paragraph 2, the court shall determine whether to impose a sentence of life or natural life.

B. Before trial, the prosecution shall notice one or more of the aggravating circumstances under section 13-751, subsection F.

C. If the trier of fact finds the defendant guilty of first degree murder, the trier of fact shall then immediately determine whether one or more alleged aggravating circumstances have been proven. This proceeding is the aggravation phase of the sentencing proceeding.

D. If the trier of fact finds that one or more of the alleged aggravating circumstances have been proven, the trier of fact shall then immediately determine whether the death penalty should be imposed.  This proceeding is the penalty phase of the sentencing proceeding.

E. At the aggravation phase, the trier of fact shall make a special finding on whether each alleged aggravating circumstance has been proven based on the evidence that was presented at the trial or at the aggravation phase.  If the trier of fact is a jury, a unanimous verdict is required to find that the aggravating circumstance has been proven.  If the trier of fact unanimously finds that an aggravating circumstance has not been proven, the defendant is entitled to a special finding that the aggravating circumstance has not been proven.  If the trier of fact unanimously finds no aggravating circumstances, the court shall then determine whether to impose a sentence of life or natural life on the defendant pursuant to subsection A of this section.

F. The penalty phase shall be held immediately after the trier of fact finds at the aggravation phase that one or more of the aggravating circumstances under section 13-751, subsection F have been proven.  A finding by the trier of fact that any of the remaining aggravating circumstances alleged has not been proven or the inability of the trier of fact to agree on the issue of whether any of the remaining aggravating circumstances alleged has been proven shall not prevent the holding of the penalty phase.

G. At the penalty phase, the defendant and the state may present any evidence that is relevant to the determination of whether there is mitigation that is sufficiently substantial to call for leniency.  In order for the trier of fact to make this determination, regardless of whether the defendant presents evidence of mitigation, the state may present any evidence that demonstrates that the defendant should not be shown leniency including any evidence regarding the defendant's character, propensities, criminal record or other acts.

H. The trier of fact shall determine unanimously whether death is the appropriate sentence.  If the trier of fact is a jury and the jury unanimously determines that the death penalty is not appropriate, the court shall determine whether to impose a sentence of life or natural life pursuant to subsection A of this section.

I. If the trier of fact at any prior phase of the trial is the same trier of fact at the subsequent phase, any evidence that was presented at any prior phase of the trial shall be deemed admitted as evidence at any subsequent phase of the trial.

J. At the aggravation phase, if the trier of fact is a jury, the jury is unable to reach a verdict on any of the alleged aggravating circumstances and the jury has not found that at least one of the alleged aggravating circumstances has been proven, the court shall dismiss the jury and shall impanel a new jury. The new jury shall not retry the issue of the defendant's guilt or the issue regarding any of the aggravating circumstances that the first jury found not proved by unanimous verdict. If the new jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the court shall impose a sentence of life or natural life on the defendant.

K. At the penalty phase, if the trier of fact is a jury and the jury is unable to reach a verdict, the court shall dismiss the jury and shall impanel a new jury. The new jury shall not retry the issue of the defendant's guilt or the issue regarding any of the aggravating circumstances that the first jury found by unanimous verdict to be proved or not proved.  If the new jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the court shall impose a sentence of life or natural life on the defendant.

L. If the jury that rendered a verdict of guilty is not the jury first impaneled for the aggravation phase, the jury impaneled in the aggravation phase shall not retry the issue of the defendant's guilt. If the jury impaneled in the aggravation phase is unable to reach a verdict on any of the alleged aggravating circumstances and the jury has not found that at least one of the alleged aggravating circumstances has been proven, the court shall dismiss the jury and shall impanel a new jury.  The new jury shall not retry the issue of the defendant's guilt or the issue regarding any of the aggravating circumstances that the first jury found not proved by unanimous verdict.  If the new jury is unable to reach a unanimous verdict, the court shall impose a sentence of life or natural life on the defendant.

M. Alternate jurors who are impaneled for the trial in a case in which the offense is punishable by death shall not be excused from the case until the completion of the sentencing proceeding.

N. If the sentence of a person who was sentenced to death is overturned, the person shall be resentenced pursuant to this section by a jury that is specifically impaneled for this purpose as if the original sentencing had not occurred.

O. In any case that requires sentencing or resentencing in which the defendant has been convicted of an offense that is punishable by death and in which the trier of fact was a judge or a jury that has since been discharged, the defendant shall be sentenced or resentenced pursuant to this section by a jury that is specifically impaneled for this purpose.

P. The trier of fact shall make all factual determinations required by this section or the Constitution of the United States or this state to impose a death sentence.  If the defendant bears the burden of proof, the issue shall be determined in the penalty phase.  If the state bears the burden of proof, the issue shall be determined in the aggravation phase.

Q. If the death penalty was not alleged or was alleged but not imposed, the court shall determine whether to impose a sentence of life or natural life pursuant to subsection A of this section. In determining whether to impose a sentence of life or natural life, the court:

1. May consider any evidence introduced before sentencing or at any other sentencing proceeding.

2. Shall consider the aggravating and mitigating circumstances listed in section 13-701 and any statement made by a victim.

R. Subject to section 13-751, subsection B, a victim has the right to be present at the aggravation phase and to present any information that is relevant to the proceeding.  A victim has the right to be present and to present information at the penalty phase.  At the penalty phase, the victim may present information about the murdered person and the impact of the murder on the victim and other family members and may submit a victim impact statement in any format to the trier of fact.

S. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Trier of fact" means a jury unless the defendant and the state waive a jury, in which case the trier of fact shall be the court.

2. "Victim" means the murdered person's spouse, parent, child, grandparent or sibling, any other person related to the murdered person by consanguinity or affinity to the second degree or any other lawful representative of the murdered person, except if the spouse, parent, child, grandparent, sibling, other person related to the murdered person by consanguinity or affinity to the second degree or other lawful representative is in custody for an offense or is the accused.

 

#### Section 13-753. Mental evaluations of capital defendants; hearing; appeal; definitions

A. In any case in which the state files a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, a person who is found to have an intellectual disability pursuant to this section shall not be sentenced to death but shall be sentenced to life or natural life.

B. If the state files a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, the court, unless the defendant objects, shall appoint a prescreening psychological expert in order to determine the defendant's intelligence quotient using current community, nationally and culturally accepted intelligence testing procedures.  The prescreening psychological expert shall submit a written report of the intelligence quotient determination to the court within ten days of the testing of the defendant.  If the defendant objects to the prescreening, the defendant waives the right to a pretrial determination of status.  The waiver does not preclude the defendant from offering evidence of the defendant's intellectual disability in the penalty phase.

C. If the prescreening psychological expert determines that the defendant's intelligence quotient is higher than seventy-five, the notice of intent to seek the death penalty shall not be dismissed on the ground that the defendant has an intellectual disability. If the prescreening psychological expert determines that the defendant's intelligence quotient is higher than seventy-five, the report shall be sealed by the court and be available only to the defendant. The report shall be released on the motion of any party if the defendant introduces the report in the present case or is convicted of an offense in the present case and the sentence is final. A prescreening determination that the defendant's intelligence quotient is higher than seventy-five does not prevent the defendant from introducing evidence of the defendant's intellectual disability or diminished mental capacity at the penalty phase of the sentencing proceeding.

D. If the prescreening psychological expert determines that the defendant's intelligence quotient is seventy-five or less, the trial court, within ten days of receiving the written report, shall order the state and the defendant to each nominate three experts in intellectual disabilities, or jointly nominate a single expert in intellectual disabilities. The trial court shall appoint one expert in intellectual disabilities nominated by the state and one expert in intellectual disabilities nominated by the defendant, or a single expert in intellectual disabilities jointly nominated by the state and the defendant, none of whom made the prescreening determination of the defendant's intelligence quotient.  The trial court, in its discretion, may appoint an additional expert in intellectual disabilities who was neither nominated by the state nor the defendant, and who did not make the prescreening determination of the defendant's intelligence quotient.  Within forty-five days after the trial court orders the state and the defendant to nominate experts in intellectual disabilities, or on the appointment of such experts, whichever is later, the state and the defendant shall provide to the experts in intellectual disabilities and the court any available records that may be relevant to the defendant's status.  The court may extend the deadline for providing records on good cause shown by the state or defendant.

E. Not less than twenty days after receipt of the records provided pursuant to subsection D, or twenty days after the expiration of the deadline for providing the records, whichever is later, each expert in intellectual disability shall examine the defendant using current community, nationally and culturally accepted physical, developmental, psychological and intelligence testing procedures, for the purpose of determining whether the defendant has an intellectual disability.  Within fifteen days of examining the defendant, each expert in intellectual disabilities shall submit a written report to the trial court that includes the expert's opinion as to whether the defendant has an intellectual disability.

F. If the scores on all the tests for intelligence quotient administered to the defendant are above seventy, the notice of intent to seek the death penalty shall not be dismissed on the ground that the defendant has an intellectual disability.  This does not preclude the defendant from introducing evidence of the defendant's intellectual disability or diminished mental capacity at the penalty phase of the sentencing proceeding.

G. No less than thirty days after the experts in intellectual disabilities submit reports to the court and before trial, the trial court shall hold a hearing to determine if the defendant has an intellectual disability.  At the hearing, the defendant has the burden of proving intellectual disability by clear and convincing evidence. A determination by the trial court that the defendant's intelligence quotient is sixty-five or lower establishes a rebuttable presumption that the defendant has an intellectual disability.  This subsection does not preclude a defendant with an intelligence quotient of seventy or below from proving intellectual disability by clear and convincing evidence.

H. If the trial court finds that the defendant has an intellectual disability, the trial court shall dismiss the intent to seek the death penalty, shall not impose a sentence of death on the defendant if the defendant is convicted of first degree murder and shall dismiss one of the attorneys appointed under rule 6.2, Arizona rules of criminal procedure, unless the court finds that there is good cause to retain both attorneys. If the trial court finds that the defendant does not have an intellectual disability, the court's finding does not prevent the defendant from introducing evidence of the defendant's intellectual disability or diminished mental capacity at the penalty phase of the sentencing proceeding.

I. Within ten days after the trial court makes a finding on intellectual disability, the state or the defendant may file a petition for special action with the Arizona court of appeals pursuant to the rules of procedure for special actions. The filing of the petition for special action is governed by the rules of procedure for special actions, except that the court of appeals shall exercise jurisdiction and decide the merits of the claims raised.

J. This section applies to all capital sentencing proceedings.

K. For the purposes of this section, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Adaptive behavior" means the effectiveness or degree to which the defendant meets the standards of personal independence and social responsibility expected of the defendant's age and cultural group.

2. "Expert in intellectual disabilities" means a psychologist or physician licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13, 17 or 19.1 with at least five years' experience in the testing or testing assessment, evaluation and diagnosis of intellectual disabilities.

3. "Intellectual disability" means a condition based on a mental deficit that involves significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning, existing concurrently with significant impairment in adaptive behavior, where the onset of the foregoing conditions occurred before the defendant reached the age of eighteen.

4. "Prescreening psychological expert" means a psychologist licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 19.1 with at least five years' experience in the testing, evaluation and diagnosis of intellectual disabilities.

5. "Significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning" means a full scale intelligence quotient of seventy or lower. The court in determining the intelligence quotient shall take into account the margin of error for the test administered.

 

#### Section 13-754. Capital defendant prescreening evaluation for competency and sanity

A. If the state files a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, unless the defendant objects, the court shall appoint a psychologist or psychiatrist licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13, 17 or 19.1 to conduct a prescreening evaluation to determine if reasonable grounds exist to conduct another examination to determine the following:

1. The defendant's competency to stand trial.

2. Whether the defendant was sane at the time the defendant allegedly committed the offense.

B. The court may appoint separate psychological experts to conduct each of the evaluations ordered pursuant to subsection A.

C. The court shall seal any psychological expert's report pursuant to this section, and the report shall only be available to the defendant.  The report shall be released on the motion of any party if the defendant introduces the report in the present case, raises a mental health defense at trial or sentencing or is convicted of an offense in the present case and the sentence is final.

D. If the prescreening evaluation indicates that reasonable grounds exist to conduct another examination as prescribed by subsection A, the court shall treat the prescreening evaluation as a preliminary examination pursuant to rule 11.2(c) of the Arizona rules of criminal procedure and shall proceed in accordance with rule 11 of the Arizona rules of criminal procedure.

 

#### Section 13-755. Death sentences; supreme court review

A. The supreme court shall review all death sentences. On review, the supreme court shall independently review the trial court's findings of aggravation and mitigation and the propriety of the death sentence.

B. If the supreme court determines that an error was made regarding a finding of aggravation or mitigation, the supreme court shall independently determine if the mitigation the supreme court finds is sufficiently substantial to warrant leniency in light of the existing aggravation. If the supreme court finds that the mitigation is not sufficiently substantial to warrant leniency, the supreme court shall affirm the death sentence. If the supreme court finds that the mitigation is sufficiently substantial to warrant leniency, the supreme court shall impose a life sentence pursuant to section 13-751, subsection A.

C. The independent review required by subsection A does not preclude the supreme court from remanding a case for further action if the trial court erroneously excluded evidence or if the appellate record does not adequately reflect the evidence presented.

 

#### Section 13-756. Death sentences; supreme court review

A. The supreme court shall review all death sentences to determine whether the trier of fact abused its discretion in finding aggravating circumstances and imposing a sentence of death.

B. If the supreme court determines that an error occurred in the sentencing proceedings, the supreme court shall determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  If the supreme court cannot determine whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the supreme court shall remand the case for a new sentencing proceeding.

 

#### Section 13-757. Method of infliction of sentence of death; identity of executioners; license suspension

A. The penalty of death shall be inflicted by an intravenous injection of a substance or substances in a lethal quantity sufficient to cause death, under the supervision of the state department of corrections.

B. A defendant who is sentenced to death for an offense committed before November 23, 1992 shall choose either lethal injection or lethal gas at least twenty days before the execution date. If the defendant fails to choose either lethal injection or lethal gas, the penalty of death shall be inflicted by lethal injection.

C. The identity of executioners and other persons who participate or perform ancillary functions in an execution and any information contained in records that would identify those persons is confidential and is not subject to disclosure pursuant to title 39, chapter 1, article 2.

D. If a person who participates or performs ancillary functions in an execution is licensed by a board, the licensing board shall not suspend or revoke the person's license as a result of the person's participation in an execution.

#### Section 13-758. Persons present at execution of sentence of death; limitation

The director of the state department of corrections or the director's designee shall be present at the execution of all death sentences and shall invite the attorney general and at least twelve reputable citizens of the director's selection to be present at the execution. The director shall, at the request of the defendant, permit clergymen, not exceeding two, whom the defendant names and any persons, relatives or friends, not exceeding five, to be present at the execution. The director may invite peace officers as the director deems expedient to witness the execution. No persons other than those set forth in this section shall be present at the execution nor shall any minor be allowed to witness the execution.

#### Section 13-759. Death warrant; return

A. After a conviction and sentence of death are affirmed and the first post-conviction relief proceedings have concluded, the supreme court shall issue a warrant of execution that authorizes the director of the state department of corrections to carry out the execution thirty-five days after the supreme court's mandate or order denying review or upon motion by the state. The supreme court shall grant subsequent warrants of execution on a motion by the state. The time for execution shall be fixed for thirty-five days after the state's motion is granted.

B. Upon the execution of a sentence of death, the director of the state department of corrections shall make a return upon the death warrant to the court which pronounced sentence and the supreme court, showing the time, mode and manner in which it was executed.

On a defendant's conviction for an offense causing economic loss to any person, the court, in its sole discretion, may order that all or any portion of the fine imposed be allocated as restitution to be paid by the defendant to any person who suffered an economic loss caused by the defendant's conduct.

B. In ordering restitution for economic loss pursuant to section 13-603, subsection C or subsection A of this section, the court shall consider all losses caused by the criminal offense or offenses for which the defendant has been convicted.

C. The court shall not consider the economic circumstances of the defendant in determining the amount of restitution.

D. Restitution payments that are ordered pursuant to section 13-603 and this section shall not be stayed if the defendant files a notice of appeal, and the payments may be held by the court pending the outcome of an appeal.

E. After the court determines the amount of restitution, the court or a staff member designated by the court, including a probation officer, shall specify the manner in which the restitution is to be paid. In deciding the manner in which the restitution is to be paid, the court or a staff member designated by the court, including a probation officer, shall make reasonable efforts to contact any victim who has requested notice pursuant to sections 13-4415 and 13-4417, shall take into account the views of the victim and shall consider the economic circumstances of the defendant. In considering the economic circumstances of the defendant, the court shall consider all of the defendant's assets and income, including workers' compensation and social security benefits. The court shall make all reasonable efforts to ensure that all persons who are entitled to restitution pursuant to a court order promptly receive full restitution. The court may enter any reasonable order necessary to accomplish this. If a victim has received reimbursement for the victim's economic loss from an insurance company, a crime victim compensation program funded pursuant to section 41-2407 or any other entity, the court shall order the defendant to pay the restitution to that entity. If a victim has received only partial reimbursement for the victim's economic loss, the court shall order the defendant to pay restitution first to the victim and then to the entity that partially reimbursed the victim. If a probation, parole or community supervision officer has reason to believe that court ordered restitution is not being made, the officer shall report to the court supervising the probationer or the board of executive clemency that the defendant has failed to make restitution in a timely manner and the court or the board of executive clemency may revoke the defendant's probation, parole or community supervision.

F. If more than one defendant is convicted of the offense that caused the loss, the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the restitution.

G. If the court does not have sufficient evidence to support a finding of the amount of restitution or the manner in which the restitution should be paid, it may conduct a hearing on the issue according to procedures established by court rule. The court may call the defendant to testify and to produce information or evidence. The state does not represent persons who have suffered economic loss at the hearing but may present evidence or information relevant to the issue of restitution.

H. After making the determinations in subsection B of this section the trial court shall enter a restitution order for each defendant that sets forth all of the following:

1. The total amount of restitution the defendant owes all persons.

2. The total amount of restitution owed to each person.

3. The manner in which the restitution is to be paid.

I. The restitution order under subsection H of this section may be supported by evidence or information introduced or submitted to the court before sentencing or any evidence previously heard by the judge during the proceedings.

J. A restitution lien shall be created in favor of the state for the total amount of the restitution.

K. A restitution lien shall be created in favor of the state for the total amount of the fine, surcharges, assessments, costs, incarceration costs and fees ordered, if any, except that a lien may not be perfected against a titled motor vehicle.

L. Notwithstanding any other law, a restitution lien is created in favor of a victim of the defendant ordered to make restitution. Monies received monthly from the defendant shall be applied first to satisfy the restitution order entered by the court and the payment of any restitution in arrears. Any monies that are owed by this state to a person who is under a restitution order shall be assigned first to discharge the restitution order, including any tax refund that is owed to the defendant.

M. If the defendant, the state or persons entitled to restitution pursuant to a court order disagree with the manner of payment established in subsection E of this section, the defendant, court or person entitled to restitution may petition the court at any time to change the manner in which the restitution is paid. Before modifying the order pertaining to the manner in which the restitution is paid, the court shall give notice and an opportunity to be heard to the defendant, the state and, on request, persons entitled to restitution pursuant to a court order.

N. The adult probation department that is supervising a probationer shall notify the court having jurisdiction over the case when the probationer becomes in arrears in an amount that totals four full court-ordered monthly payments of victim restitution. The notification must include the reason for the arrearage as independently confirmed by the supervising probation officer, the expected duration of the arrearage and a recommendation to the court that either further action is not warranted at this time or that a review hearing should be held pursuant to this section. If the adult probation department recommends that no further action is warranted, the adult probation department shall include specific reasons for the recommendation.  A copy of the notification shall be provided to the state and to the victim if the victim has requested notice pursuant to section 13-4415.  The prosecutor or the victim may file a written objection to the recommendation that includes the reasons for the objection.  Any objection must be filed with the court within ten days after the notification was provided to the party.

O. The court shall hold a review hearing if requested by the state or the victim or, after considering the notification from the adult probation department and any objection filed, may hold a review hearing on its own motion.  If requested by the state or victim, the hearing must be held within forty-five days after the court received the request.  A review hearing is not required if a petition to revoke probation or an order to show cause is filed.  At the review hearing, the court may take any action that is permitted by law.

P. Subsections N and O of this section do not preclude the filing of a petition to revoke or modify probation or an order to show cause pursuant to section 13-810.

#### Section 13-804.01. Reimbursement of incarceration costs; misdemeanors

A. The court shall order a person who is convicted of a misdemeanor offense and who is sentenced to a term of incarceration to reimburse the political subdivision that is responsible for the costs of the person's incarceration for the incarceration costs.

B. The court may determine the amount of incarceration costs to be paid based on the following factors:

2. For all restitution orders in favor of a victim, including liens and criminal restitution orders, for purposes of ordering, modifying and enforcing the manner in which payments are made until paid in full.

B. At the time the defendant is ordered to pay restitution by the court, the court may enter a criminal restitution order in favor of each person who is entitled to restitution for the unpaid balance of any restitution order.  A criminal restitution order does not affect any other monetary obligation imposed on the defendant pursuant to law.

C. At the time the defendant completes the defendant's period of probation or the defendant's sentence or the defendant absconds from probation or the defendant's sentence, the court shall enter both:

1. A criminal restitution order in favor of the state for the unpaid balance, if any, of any fines, costs, incarceration costs, fees, surcharges or assessments imposed.

2. A criminal restitution order in favor of each person entitled to restitution for the unpaid balance of any restitution ordered, if a criminal restitution order is not issued pursuant to subsection B of this section.

D. The clerk of the court shall notify each person who is entitled to restitution of the criminal restitution order.

E. A criminal restitution order may be recorded and is enforceable as any civil judgment, except that a criminal restitution order does not require renewal pursuant to section 12-1611 or 12-1612. Enforcement of a criminal restitution order by any person or by the state on behalf of any person who is entitled to restitution includes the collection of interest that accrues at a rate of ten percent a year. Enforcement of a criminal restitution order by the state includes the collection of interest that accrues at a rate of four percent a year.  A criminal restitution order does not expire until paid in full. A filing fee, a recording fee or any other charge is not required for recording a criminal restitution order.

F. All monies paid pursuant to a criminal restitution order entered by the court shall be paid to the clerk of the court.

1. Restitution ordered that is reduced to a criminal restitution order.

2. Associated interest.

H. The interest accrued pursuant to subsection E of this section does not apply to fees imposed for collection of the court ordered payments.

I. A criminal restitution order is a criminal penalty for the purposes of a federal bankruptcy involving the defendant.

#### Section 13-806. Restitution lien

A. The state or any person entitled to restitution pursuant to a court order may file in accordance with this section a restitution lien. A filing fee, a recording fee or any other charge is not required for filing or releasing a restitution lien.

B. A restitution lien shall be signed by the attorney representing the state in the criminal action or by a magistrate and shall set forth all of the following information:

1. The name and date of birth of the defendant whose property or other interests are subject to the lien.

2. The present residence or principal place of business of the person named in the lien, if known.

3. The criminal proceeding pursuant to which the lien is filed, including the name of the court, the title of the action and the court's file number.

D. A victim in a criminal proceeding may file a restitution lien after restitution is determined and ordered by the trial court following pronouncement of the judgment and sentence.

E. A restitution lien is perfected against interests in personal property by filing the lien with the secretary of state, except that in the case of titled motor vehicles it shall be filed with the department of transportation motor vehicle division. A restitution lien is perfected against interests in real property by filing the lien with the county recorder of the county in which the real property is located. The state or a victim may give the additional notice of the lien as either deems appropriate.

F. The filing of a restitution lien in accordance with this section creates a lien in favor of the state or the victim in all of the following:

1. Any interest of the defendant in real property situated in the county in which the lien is filed then maintained or thereafter acquired in the name of the defendant identified in the lien.

2. Any interest of the defendant in personal property situated in this state then maintained or thereafter acquired in the name of the defendant identified in the lien.

A defendant who is convicted in a criminal proceeding is precluded from subsequently denying in any civil proceeding brought by the victim or this state against the criminal defendant the essential allegations of the criminal offense of which he was adjudged guilty, including judgments of guilt resulting from no contest pleas.

E. If the court finds that the defendant has wilfully failed to pay a fine, a surcharge, a fee, an assessment, restitution or incarceration costs or finds that the defendant has intentionally refused to make a good faith effort to obtain the monies required for the payment, the court shall find that the default constitutes contempt and may do any of the following:

1. Order the defendant incarcerated in the county jail until the fine, surcharge, fee, assessment, restitution or incarceration costs, or a specified part of the fine, surcharge, fee, assessment, restitution or incarceration costs, is paid.

3. Enter an order pursuant to section 13-812.

4. Order the defendant to perform community restitution.

F. If the court finds that the default is not wilful and that the defendant cannot pay despite sufficient good faith efforts to obtain the monies, the court may take any lawful action including:

G. If a fine, a surcharge, a fee, an assessment, restitution or incarceration costs are imposed on an enterprise it is the duty of the person or persons authorized to make disbursement from the assets of the enterprise to pay them from those assets, and their failure to do so shall be held a contempt unless they make the showing required in subsection A or B of this section.

H. If a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine, a surcharge, a fee, an assessment, restitution or incarceration costs, the clerk of the sentencing court, on request, shall make the defendant's payment history available to the prosecutor, victim, victim's attorney, probation department and court without cost.

The copy of the writ shall be served at any office or branch that is located in the county in which the service is made. A garnishment is not effective as to any debt owed by a banking corporation or association, savings bank, savings and loan association, credit union, trust company or title insurance company if the account evidencing the indebtedness is carried at an office or branch other than the office or branch named in the writ and at which service is made or, as to credits or other effects in its possession or under its control, at any other office or branch unless the service of the writ is accompanied by twenty-five dollars to be paid to the garnishee for the costs of the search.

#### Section 13-822. Effective programs to prevent and detect violations of law; fines

A. If based on any evidence or information introduced or submitted to the court before sentencing or on any evidence that was previously heard at trial the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that an enterprise had an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law in effect at the time the offense was committed, the court shall set forth on the record its factual findings and the reasons in support of its findings and shall reduce the fine imposed pursuant to section 13-803, if any, by twenty-five per cent.

B. An effective program to prevent and detect violations of law requires at a minimum that the enterprise does the following:

1. Establish compliance standards and procedures to be followed by its employees and other agents that are reasonably capable of reducing the prospect of violations of law.

2. Assign specific high-level personnel within the enterprise overall responsibility to oversee compliance with the standards and procedures.

3. Use due care not to delegate substantial discretionary authority to individuals whom the enterprise knows, or should know through the exercise of due diligence, have a propensity to engage in illegal activities.

4. Take steps to communicate effectively its standards and procedures to all employees and other agents, including requiring participation in training programs or disseminating publications that explain in a practical manner what is required.

5. Take reasonable steps to achieve compliance with its standards, including the use of monitoring and auditing systems reasonably designed to detect violations of law by its employees and other agents and having in place and publicizing a reporting system where employees and other agents can report violations of law by others within the enterprise without fear of retribution.

6. Consistently enforce the standards through appropriate disciplinary mechanisms, including, as appropriate, discipline of individuals responsible for the failure to detect a violation.

7. After a violation is detected, take all reasonable steps to respond appropriately to the violation and to prevent further similar violations, including any necessary modifications to its program to prevent and detect violations of law.

C. Relevant factors for determining precise actions necessary for an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law include:

1. The size of the enterprise.

2. The likelihood that certain violations may occur because of the nature of the enterprise's business.

3. The prior history of the enterprise.

D. The failure of an enterprise to incorporate and follow applicable industry practice or the standards called for by any applicable governmental rule weighs against a finding of an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law.

E. An enterprise’s failure to prevent or detect violations of law, by itself, does not mean that the program is not effective if the court finds that the enterprise exercised due diligence in establishing and maintaining its program at the time the acts constituting the offense were committed.

F. This section does not apply if any of the following applies:

1. A high managerial agent of the enterprise, a unit of the enterprise with two hundred or more employees and within which the offense was committed or an individual who is responsible for the administration or enforcement of a program to prevent and detect violations of law participated in, condoned or was wilfully ignorant of the offense.  It is a rebuttable presumption that the enterprise did not have an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law if an individual with substantial supervisory authority participates in an offense.

2. After becoming aware of an offense, the enterprise unreasonably delayed reporting the offense to the appropriate governmental authorities. An enterprise shall report an offense within seventy-two hours.

3. The enterprise wilfully obstructed or impeded, attempted to obstruct or impede or aided, abetted or encouraged the obstruction of justice during the investigation, prosecution or sentencing of the offense or, with knowledge of the offense, failed to take reasonable steps to prevent the obstruction or impediment or the attempted obstruction or impediment.

4. If the offense is discovered by the government before disclosure by the enterprise unless, under the circumstances of the offense, no high managerial agent knew or could reasonably have known of the conduct constituting the offense.

#### Section 13-823. Dangerous and repeat enterprise offenders; fines

A. Whether or not an enterprise maintains an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law pursuant to section 13-822, the court may subject an enterprise to five times the maximum fine authorized by section 13-803 if based on any evidence that was introduced before sentencing or that was heard at trial the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that any of the following applies to the commission of the offense:

1. The offense violated a judicial or administrative order or injunction, other than a violation of a condition of probation or that the enterprise or a separately managed line of business violated a condition of probation by engaging in misconduct similar to that for which it was placed on probation.

2. The offense involved conduct that was malicious or wanton.

3. The offense involved conduct that posed an imminent and substantial hazard to human health or to the environment or resulted in serious actual harm to human health or to the environment and the enterprise continued the conduct after receiving notice.

B. For the purposes of this section, an enterprise is deemed to have received notice if an officer, director or high managerial agent has actual knowledge that the enterprise is engaging in the conduct that constitutes a violation of law and the officer, director or high managerial agent knows or is recklessly indifferent to the fact that the conduct is or may be harmful.

#### Section 13-824. Community restitution in lieu of monetary obligation; definition

A. Notwithstanding any other law, if a monetary obligation is imposed on a defendant at sentencing and the court finds the defendant is unable to pay all or part of the monetary obligation, on the defendant's request the court may order the defendant to perform community restitution in lieu of the payment for all or part of the monetary obligation. The court shall credit community restitution performed at a rate that is equal to the minimum wage prescribed by section 23-363, subsections A and B, rounded up to the nearest dollar.

B. This section does not apply to the assessment imposed pursuant to sections 12-116.05, 12-116.06, 12-116.07, 12-116.08 and 12-116.09 and to the surcharge imposed and collected pursuant to section 16-954, subsection A.

C. For the purposes of this section, "monetary obligation" means a fine, a civil penalty, a surcharge, an assessment, a fee or incarceration costs.

#### Section 13-825. Mitigation of fines and surcharges

A. A judge may mitigate a fine if the defendant who is ordered to pay the fine demonstrates that the payment would work a hardship on the defendant or on the defendant's immediate family, except that a judge may not mitigate a fine imposed pursuant to section 28-1381, 28-1382 or 28-1383.

B. In determining whether to mitigate a fine, the court may consider any relevant evidence, including:

1. The impact of the fine on the ability of the defendant to pay the restitution.

2. The extent of the financial hardship on the defendant or on the defendant's immediate family.

3. Whether the defendant is receiving benefits pursuant to any of the following:

(a) The temporary assistance for needy families program established by section 403 of title IV of the social security act.

(b) The supplemental nutrition assistance program (7 United States Code sections 2011 through 2036c).

(c) The supplemental security income program (42 United States Code sections 1381 through 1383f).

4. Whether the defendant is seeking, obtaining or maintaining employment if legally permitted to do so or is attending school.

5. A defendant's medical condition.

C. A judge may mitigate a surcharge that is imposed pursuant to sections 12-116.01 and 12-116.02 if the fine is mandatory.

###    -

#### Section 13-901. Probation

A. If a person who has been convicted of an offense is eligible for probation, the court may suspend the imposition or execution of sentence and, if so, shall without delay place the person on intensive probation supervision pursuant to section 13-913 or supervised or unsupervised probation on such terms and conditions as the law requires and the court deems appropriate, including participation in any programs authorized in title 12, chapter 2, article 11. If a person is not eligible for probation, imposition or execution of sentence shall not be suspended or delayed. If the court imposes probation, it may also impose a fine as authorized by chapter 8 of this title. If probation is granted the court shall impose a condition that the person waive extradition for any probation revocation procedures and it shall order restitution pursuant to section 13-603, subsection C where there is a victim who has suffered economic loss. When granting probation to an adult the court, as a condition of probation, shall assess a monthly fee of not less than $65 unless, after determining the inability of the probationer to pay the fee, the court assesses a lesser fee. This fee is not subject to any surcharge.  In justice and municipal courts the fee shall only be assessed when the person is placed on supervised probation.  For persons placed on probation in the superior court, the fee shall be paid to the clerk of the superior court and the clerk of the court shall pay all monies collected from this fee to the county treasurer for deposit in the adult probation services fund established by section 12-267. For persons placed on supervised probation in the justice court, the fee shall be paid to the justice court and the justice court shall transmit all of the monies to the county treasurer for deposit in the adult probation services fund established by section 12-267. For persons placed on supervised probation in the municipal court, the fee shall be paid to the municipal court. The municipal court shall transmit all of the monies to the city treasurer who shall transmit the monies to the county treasurer for deposit in the adult probation services fund established by section 12-267. Any amount assessed pursuant to this subsection shall be used to supplement monies used for the salaries of adult probation and surveillance officers and for support of programs and services of the superior court adult probation departments.

B. The period of probation shall be determined according to section 13-902, except that if a person is released pursuant to section 31-233, subsection B and community supervision is waived pursuant to section 13-603, subsection K, the court shall extend the period of probation by the amount of time the director of the state department of corrections approves for the inmate's temporary release.

C. The court, in its discretion, may issue a warrant for the rearrest of the defendant and may modify or add to the conditions or, if the defendant commits an additional offense or violates a condition, may revoke probation in accordance with the rules of criminal procedure at any time before the expiration or termination of the period of probation. If the court revokes the defendant's probation and the defendant is serving more than one probationary term concurrently, the court may sentence the person to terms of imprisonment to be served consecutively.

D. At any time during the probationary term of the person released on probation, any probation officer, without warrant or other process and at any time until the final disposition of the case, may rearrest any person and bring the person before the court.

E. The court, on its own initiative or on application of the probationer, after notice and an opportunity to be heard for the prosecuting attorney and, on request, the victim, may terminate the period of probation or intensive probation and discharge the defendant at a time earlier than that originally imposed if in the court's opinion the ends of justice will be served and if the conduct of the defendant on probation warrants it.

F. When granting probation the court may require that the defendant be imprisoned in the county jail at whatever time or intervals, consecutive or nonconsecutive, the court shall determine, within the period of probation, as long as the period actually spent in confinement does not exceed one year or the maximum period of imprisonment permitted under chapter 7 of this title, whichever is the shorter.

G. If the defendant is placed on lifetime probation and has served one year in the county jail as a term of probation, the court may require that the defendant be additionally imprisoned in the county jail at whatever time or intervals, consecutive or nonconsecutive, the court shall determine, within the period of probation if the defendant's probation is revoked by the court and the defendant is subsequently reinstated on probation. The period actually spent in confinement as a term of being reinstated on probation shall not exceed one year or, when including the initial one year period of incarceration imposed as a term of probation, the maximum period of imprisonment permitted under chapter 7 of this title, whichever is shorter.

D. The attorney general or the county attorney filing the lien shall, as soon as practical after filing a racketeering lien, furnish to any person named in the lien a notice of the filing of the lien.

#### Section 13-2314.04. Racketeering; unlawful activity; civil remedies by private cause of action; definitions

A. A person who sustains reasonably foreseeable injury to his person, business or property by a pattern of racketeering activity, or by a violation of section 13-2312 involving a pattern of racketeering activity, may file an action in superior court for the recovery of up to treble damages and the costs of the suit, including reasonable attorney fees for trial and appellate representation. If the person against whom a racketeering claim has been asserted, including a lien, prevails on that claim, the person may be awarded costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred in defense of that claim. No person may rely on any conduct that would have been actionable as fraud in the purchase or sale of securities to establish an action under this section except an action against a person who is convicted of a crime in connection with the fraud, in which case the period to initiate a civil action starts to run on the date on which the conviction becomes final.

B. The superior court has jurisdiction to prevent, restrain and remedy a pattern of racketeering activity or a violation of section 13-2312 involving a pattern of racketeering activity, after making provision for the rights of all innocent persons affected by the violation and after a hearing or trial, as appropriate, by issuing appropriate orders.

C. Before a determination of liability these orders may include, but are not limited to, entering restraining orders or prohibitions or taking such other actions, including the acceptance of satisfactory performance bonds, the creation of receiverships and the enforcement of constructive trusts, in connection with any property or other interest subject to damage or other remedies or restraints pursuant to this section as the court deems proper.

D. After a determination of liability these orders may include, but are not limited to:

1. Ordering any person to divest himself of any interest, direct or indirect, in any enterprise.

2. Imposing reasonable restrictions on the future activities or investments of any person, including prohibiting any person from engaging in the same type of endeavor as the enterprise engaged in, the activities of which affect the laws of this state, to the extent the constitutions of the United States and this state permit.

3. Ordering dissolution or reorganization of any enterprise.

4. Ordering the payment of up to treble damages to those persons injured by a pattern of racketeering activity or a violation of section 13-2312 involving a pattern of racketeering activity.

5. Prejudgment interest on damages, except that prejudgment interest may not be awarded on any increase in the damages authorized under paragraph 4 of this subsection.

6. A person or enterprise that acquires any property through an offense included in the definition of racketeering in section 13-2301, subsection D or a violation of section 13-2312 is an involuntary trustee. The involuntary trustee and any other person or enterprise, except a bona fide purchaser for value who is reasonably without notice of the unlawful conduct and who is not knowingly taking part in an illegal transaction, hold the property, its proceeds and its fruits in constructive trust for the benefit of persons entitled to remedies under this section.

E. A defendant convicted in any criminal proceeding is precluded from subsequently denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense of which the defendant was convicted in any civil proceedings. For the purpose of this subsection, a conviction may result from a verdict or plea including a no contest plea.

F. Notwithstanding any law prescribing a lesser period but subject to subsection A of this section, the initiation of civil proceedings pursuant to this section shall be commenced within three years from the date the violation was discovered, or should have been discovered with reasonable diligence, and ten years after the events giving rise to the cause of action, whichever comes first.

G. The standard of proof in actions brought pursuant to this section is the preponderance of evidence test.

H. A person who files an action under this section shall serve notice and one copy of the pleading on the attorney general within thirty days after the action is filed with the superior court. This requirement is jurisdictional. The notice shall identify the action, the person and the person's attorney. Service of the notice does not limit or otherwise affect the right of the state to maintain an action under section 13-2314 or to intervene in a pending action nor does it authorize the person to name this state or the attorney general as a party to the action.

I. On timely application, the attorney general may intervene in any civil action or proceeding brought under this section if the attorney general certifies that in the attorney general's opinion the action is of special public importance. On intervention, the attorney general may assert any available claim and is entitled to the same relief as if the attorney general has instituted a separate action.

J. In addition to the state's right to intervene as a party in any action under this section, the attorney general may appear as amicus curiae in any proceeding in which a claim under this section has been asserted or in which a court is interpreting section 13-2301, 13-2312, 13-2313, 13-2314.01, 13-2314.02 or 13-2315 or this section.

K. A civil action authorized by this section is remedial and not punitive and does not limit and is not limited by any other previous or subsequent civil or criminal action under this title or any other provision of law. Civil remedies provided under this title are supplemental and not mutually exclusive, except that a person may not recover, for an action brought pursuant to this section, punitive damages or emotional injury damages in the absence of bodily injury.

L. A natural person shall not be held liable in damages or for other relief pursuant to this section based on the conduct of another unless the fact finder finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the natural person authorized, requested, commanded, ratified or recklessly tolerated the unlawful conduct of the other. An enterprise shall not be held liable in damages or for other relief pursuant to this section based on the conduct of an agent, unless the fact finder finds by a preponderance of the evidence that a director or high managerial agent performed, authorized, requested, commanded, ratified or recklessly tolerated the unlawful conduct of the agent. A bank or savings and loan association insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation or a credit union insured by the national credit union administration shall not be held liable in damages or for other relief pursuant to this section for conduct proscribed by section 13-2317, subsection B, paragraph 1, based on acquiring or maintaining an interest in or transporting, transacting, transferring or receiving funds belonging to a person other than the person presenting the funds, unless the fact finder finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the person or agent acquiring or maintaining an interest in or transporting, transacting, transferring or receiving the funds on behalf of the defendant did so knowing that the funds were the proceeds of an offense and that a director or high managerial agent performed, authorized, requested, commanded, ratified or recklessly tolerated the unlawful conduct of the person or agent. A person or enterprise shall not be held liable in damages or for other relief pursuant to this section unless the fact finder makes particularized findings sufficient to permit full and complete review of the record, if any, of the conduct of the person. A natural person or enterprise shall not be held liable in damages for recklessly tolerating the unlawful conduct of another person or agent if the other person or agent engaged in unlawful conduct proscribed by section 13-2301, subsection D, paragraph 4, subdivision (b), item (xvi), (xviii), (xix) or (xx) and the unlawful conduct involved the purchase or sale of securities.

M. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a court shall not award costs, including attorney fees, if the award would be unjust because of special circumstances, including the relevant disparate economic position of the parties or the disproportionate amount of the costs, including attorney fees, to the nature of the damage or other relief obtained.

N. If the court determines that the filing of any pleading, motion or other paper under this section was frivolous or that any civil action or proceeding was brought or continued under this section in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for an improper or oppressive reason, it shall award a proper sanction to deter this conduct in the future that may include the costs of the civil action or proceeding, including the costs of investigation and reasonable attorney fees in the trial and appellate courts.

O. Notwithstanding any other law, a complaint, counterclaim, answer or response filed by a person in connection with a civil action or proceeding under this section shall be verified by at least one party or the party's attorney.  If the person is represented by an attorney, at least one attorney of record shall sign any pleading, motion or other paper in the attorney's individual name and shall state the attorney's address.

P. The verification by a person or the person's attorney and the signature by an attorney required by subsection O of this section constitute a certification by the person or the person's attorney that the person or the person's attorney has carefully read the pleading, motion or other paper and, based on a reasonable inquiry, believes all of the following:

1. It is well grounded in fact.

2. It is warranted by existing law or there is a good faith argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law.

3. It is not made for any bad faith, vexatious, wanton, improper or oppressive reason, including to harass, to cause unnecessary delay, to impose a needless increase in the cost of litigation or to force an unjust settlement through the serious character of the averment.

Q. If any pleading, motion or other paper is signed in violation of the certification provisions of subsection P of this section, the court, on its own motion or on the motion of the other party and after a hearing and appropriate findings of fact, shall impose on the person who verified it or the attorney who signed it, or both, a proper sanction to deter this conduct in the future, including the costs of the proceeding under subsection N of this section.

R. If any pleading, motion or other paper includes an averment of fraud or coercion, it shall state these circumstances with particularity with respect to each defendant.

S. In any civil action or proceeding under this section in which the pleading, motion or other paper does not allege a crime of violence as a racketeering act:

1. The term "racketeer" shall not be used in referring to any person.

2. The terms used to refer to acts of racketeering or a pattern of racketeering activity shall be "unlawful acts" or "a pattern of unlawful activity".

1. The relationship between the victim and the defendant is one of marriage or former marriage or of persons residing or having resided in the same household.

2. The victim and the defendant have a child in common.

3. The victim or the defendant is pregnant by the other party.

4. The victim is related to the defendant or the defendant's spouse by blood or court order as a parent, grandparent, child, grandchild, brother or sister or by marriage as a parent-in-law, grandparent-in-law, stepparent, step-grandparent, stepchild, step-grandchild, brother-in-law or sister-in-law.

5. The victim is a child who resides or has resided in the same household as the defendant and is related by blood to a former spouse of the defendant or to a person who resides or who has resided in the same household as the defendant.

6. The relationship between the victim and the defendant is currently or was previously a romantic or sexual relationship. The following factors may be considered in determining whether the relationship between the victim and the defendant is currently or was previously a romantic or sexual relationship:

(a) The type of relationship.

(b) The length of the relationship.

(c) The frequency of the interaction between the victim and the defendant.

(d) If the relationship has terminated, the length of time since the termination.

B. A peace officer, with or without a warrant, may arrest a person if the officer has probable cause to believe that domestic violence has been committed and the officer has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed the offense, whether the offense is a felony or a misdemeanor and whether the offense was committed within or without the presence of the peace officer. In cases of domestic violence involving the infliction of physical injury or involving the discharge, use or threatening exhibition of a deadly weapon or dangerous instrument, the peace officer shall arrest a person who is at least fifteen years of age, with or without a warrant, if the officer has probable cause to believe that the offense has been committed and the officer has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed the offense, whether the offense was committed within or without the presence of the peace officer, unless the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the circumstances at the time are such that the victim will be protected from further injury. Failure to make an arrest does not give rise to civil liability except pursuant to section 12-820.02. In order to arrest both parties, the peace officer shall have probable cause to believe that both parties independently have committed an act of domestic violence. An act of self-defense that is justified under chapter 4 of this title is not deemed to be an act of domestic violence. The release procedures available under section 13-3883, subsection A, paragraph 4 and section 13-3903 are not applicable to arrests made pursuant to this subsection.

C. A peace officer may question the persons who are present to determine if a firearm is present on the premises. On learning or observing that a firearm is present on the premises, the peace officer may temporarily seize the firearm if the firearm is in plain view or was found pursuant to a consent to search and if the officer reasonably believes that the firearm would expose the victim or another person in the household to a risk of serious bodily injury or death. A firearm that is owned or possessed by the victim shall not be seized unless there is probable cause to believe that both parties independently have committed an act of domestic violence.

D. If a firearm is seized pursuant to subsection C of this section, the peace officer shall give the owner or possessor of the firearm a receipt for each seized firearm. The receipt shall indicate the identification or serial number or other identifying characteristic of each seized firearm. Each seized firearm shall be held for at least seventy-two hours by the law enforcement agency that seized the firearm.

E. If a firearm is seized pursuant to subsection C of this section, the victim shall be notified by a peace officer before the firearm is released from temporary custody.

F. If there is reasonable cause to believe that returning a firearm to the owner or possessor may endanger the victim, the person who reported the assault or threat or another person in the household, the prosecutor shall file a notice of intent to retain the firearm in the appropriate superior, justice or municipal court. The prosecutor shall serve notice on the owner or possessor of the firearm by certified mail. The notice shall state that the firearm will be retained for not more than six months following the date of seizure. On receipt of the notice, the owner or possessor may request a hearing for the return of the firearm, to dispute the grounds for seizure or to request an earlier return date. The court shall hold the hearing within ten days after receiving the owner's or possessor's request for a hearing.  At the hearing, unless the court determines that the return of the firearm may endanger the victim, the person who reported the assault or threat or another person in the household, the court shall order the return of the firearm to the owner or possessor.

G. A peace officer is not liable for any act or omission in the good faith exercise of the officer's duties under subsections C, D, E and F of this section.

H. Each indictment, information, complaint, summons or warrant that is issued and that involves domestic violence shall state that the offense involved domestic violence and shall be designated by the letters DV. A domestic violence charge shall not be dismissed or a domestic violence conviction shall not be set aside for failure to comply with this subsection.

I. A person who is arrested pursuant to subsection B of this section may be released from custody in accordance with the Arizona rules of criminal procedure or any other applicable statute. Any order for release, with or without an appearance bond, shall include pretrial release conditions that are necessary to provide for the protection of the alleged victim and other specifically designated persons and may provide for additional conditions that the court deems appropriate, including participation in any counseling programs available to the defendant.

J. When a peace officer responds to a call alleging that domestic violence has been or may be committed, the officer shall inform in writing any alleged or potential victim of the procedures and resources available for the protection of the victim including:

1. An order of protection pursuant to section 13-3602, an injunction pursuant to section 25-315 and an injunction against harassment pursuant to section 12-1809.

2. The emergency telephone number for the local police agency.

3. Telephone numbers for emergency services in the local community.

4. Websites for local resources related to domestic violence.

K. A peace officer is not civilly liable for noncompliance with subsection J of this section.

L. If a person is convicted of an offense involving domestic violence and the victim was pregnant at the time of the commission of the offense, at the time of sentencing the court shall take into consideration the fact that the victim was pregnant and may increase the sentence.

M. An offense that is included in domestic violence carries the classification prescribed in the section of this title in which the offense is classified. If the defendant committed a felony offense listed in subsection A of this section against a pregnant victim and knew that the victim was pregnant or if the defendant committed a felony offense causing physical injury to a pregnant victim and knew that the victim was pregnant, the maximum sentence otherwise authorized for that violation shall be increased by up to two years.

N. When a peace officer responds to a call alleging that domestic violence has been or may be committed, the officer shall determine if a minor is present.  If a minor is present, the peace officer shall conduct a child welfare check to determine if the child is safe and if the child might be a victim of domestic violence or child abuse.

 

#### Section 13-3601.01. Domestic violence; treatment; definition

A. The judge shall order a person who is convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense to complete a domestic violence offender treatment program that is provided by a facility approved by the court pursuant to rules adopted by the supreme court, the department of health services, the United States department of veterans affairs or a probation department.  If a person has previously been ordered to complete a domestic violence offender treatment program pursuant to this section, the judge shall order the person to complete a domestic violence offender treatment program unless the judge deems that alternative sanctions are more appropriate. The department of health services shall adopt and enforce guidelines that establish standards for domestic violence offender treatment program approval.

B. On conviction of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense, if a person within a period of sixty months has previously been convicted of a violation of a domestic violence offense or is convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense and has previously been convicted of an act in another state, a court of the United States or a tribal court that if committed in this state would be a domestic violence offense, the judge may order the person to be placed on supervised probation and the person may be incarcerated as a condition of probation. If the court orders supervised probation, the court may conduct an intake assessment when the person begins the term of probation and may conduct a discharge summary when the person is released from probation.  If the person is incarcerated and the court receives confirmation that the person is employed or is a student, the court, on pronouncement of any jail sentence, may provide in the sentence that the person, if the person is employed or is a student and can continue the person's employment or studies, may continue the employment or studies for not more than twelve hours a day nor more than five days a week.  The person shall spend the remaining day, days or parts of days in jail until the sentence is served and shall be allowed out of jail only long enough to complete the actual hours of employment or studies.

C. A person who is ordered to complete a domestic violence offender treatment program shall pay the cost of the program.

D. If a person is ordered to attend a domestic violence offender treatment program pursuant to this section, the program shall report to the court whether the person has attended the program and has successfully completed the program.

E. For the purposes of this section, prior convictions for misdemeanor domestic violence offenses apply to convictions for offenses that were committed on or after January 1, 1999.

B. A person who is convicted under this section and who within a period of eighty-four months has been convicted of two prior violations of a domestic violence offense or acts in another state, a court of the United States or a tribal court that if committed in this state would be a domestic violence offense is not eligible for probation, pardon, commutation or suspension of sentence or release on any other basis until the person has served not less than four months in jail.

C. A person who is convicted under this section and who within a period of eighty-four months has been convicted of three or more prior violations of a domestic violence offense or acts in another state, a court of the United States or a tribal court that if committed in this state would be a domestic violence offense is not eligible for probation, pardon, commutation or suspension of sentence or release on any other basis until the person has served not less than eight months in jail.

D. The dates of the commission of the offenses are the determining factor in applying the eighty-four month provision in subsection A of this section regardless of the sequence in which the offenses were committed.  For purposes of this section, a third or subsequent violation for which a conviction occurs does not include a conviction for an offense arising out of the same series of acts.

E. For the purposes of this section, prior convictions for misdemeanor domestic violence offenses apply only to convictions for offenses that were committed on or after January 1, 1999.

F. Aggravated domestic violence is a class 5 felony.

G. For the purposes of this section, "domestic violence offense" means an offense involving domestic violence as defined in section 13-3601.

 

#### Section 13-3602. Order of protection; procedure; contents; arrest for violation; penalty; protection order from another jurisdiction; definition

A. A person may file a verified petition, as in civil actions, with a magistrate, justice of the peace or superior court judge for an order of protection for the purpose of restraining a person from committing an act included in domestic violence.  If the person is a minor, the parent, legal guardian or person who has legal custody of the minor shall file the petition unless the court determines otherwise.  The petition shall name the parent, guardian or custodian as the plaintiff and the minor is a specifically designated person for the purposes of subsection G of this section. If a person is either temporarily or permanently unable to request an order, a third party may request an order of protection on behalf of the plaintiff.  After the request, the judicial officer shall determine if the third party is an appropriate requesting party for the plaintiff.  For the purposes of this section, notwithstanding the location of the plaintiff or defendant, any court in this state may issue or enforce an order of protection.

B. An order of protection shall not be granted:

1. Unless the party who requests the order files a written verified petition for an order.

2. Against a person who is less than twelve years of age unless the order is granted by the juvenile division of the superior court.

3. Against more than one defendant.

C. The petition shall state the:

1. Name of the plaintiff. The plaintiff's address and contact information shall be disclosed to the court for purposes of service and notification. The address and contact information shall not be listed on the petition. Whether or not the court issues an order of protection, the plaintiff's address and contact information shall be maintained in a separate document or automated database and is not subject to release or disclosure by the court or any form of public access except as ordered by the court.

6. Desired relief.

D. A fee shall not be charged for filing a petition under this section or for service of process. Each court shall provide, without charge, forms for purposes of this section for assisting parties without counsel. The court shall make reasonable efforts to provide the appropriate information to both parties on emergency and counseling services that are available in the local area.

E. The court shall review the petition, any other pleadings on file and any evidence offered by the plaintiff, including any evidence of harassment by electronic contact or communication, to determine whether the orders requested should issue without further hearing. The court shall issue an order of protection under subsection G of this section if the court determines that there is reasonable cause to believe any of the following:

1. The defendant may commit an act of domestic violence.

2. The defendant has committed an act of domestic violence within the past year or within a longer period of time if the court finds that good cause exists to consider a longer period.

F. For the purposes of determining the period of time under subsection E, paragraph 2 of this section, any time that the defendant has been incarcerated or out of this state shall not be counted.  If the court denies the requested relief, it may schedule a further hearing within ten days, with reasonable notice to the defendant.

G. If a court issues an order of protection, the court may do any of the following:

1. Enjoin the defendant from committing a violation of one or more of the offenses included in domestic violence.

2. Grant one party the use and exclusive possession of the parties' residence on a showing that there is reasonable cause to believe that physical harm may otherwise result.  If the other party is accompanied by a law enforcement officer, the other party may return to the residence on one occasion to retrieve belongings. A law enforcement officer is not liable for any act or omission in the good faith exercise of the officer's duties under this paragraph.  While the order of protection is in effect, if a party was granted the use and exclusive possession of the parties' residence and subsequently moves out of the house, the party must file a notice in writing with the court within five days after moving out of the residence. After receiving the notification from the plaintiff, the court shall provide notice to the defendant that the plaintiff has moved out of the residence and of the defendant's right to request a hearing pursuant to subsection L of this section.

3. Restrain the defendant from contacting the plaintiff or other specifically designated persons and from coming near the residence, place of employment or school of the plaintiff or other specifically designated locations or persons on a showing that there is reasonable cause to believe that physical harm may otherwise result.

4. If the court finds that the defendant is a credible threat to the physical safety of the plaintiff or other specifically designated persons, prohibit the defendant from possessing or purchasing a firearm for the duration of the order.  If the court prohibits the defendant from possessing a firearm, the court shall also order the defendant to transfer any firearm owned or possessed by the defendant immediately after service of the order to the appropriate law enforcement agency for the duration of the order. If the defendant does not immediately transfer the firearm, the defendant shall transfer the firearm within twenty-four hours after service of the order.

5. If the order was issued after notice and a hearing at which the defendant had an opportunity to participate, require the defendant to complete a domestic violence offender treatment program that is provided by a facility approved by the department of health services or a probation department or any other program deemed appropriate by the court.

6. Grant relief that is necessary for the protection of the alleged victim and other specifically designated persons and that is proper under the circumstances.

7. Grant the plaintiff the exclusive care, custody or control of any animal that is owned, possessed, leased, kept or held by the plaintiff, the defendant or a minor child residing in the residence or household of the plaintiff or the defendant, and order the defendant to stay away from the animal and forbid the defendant from taking, transferring, encumbering, concealing, committing an act of cruelty or neglect in violation of section 13-2910 or otherwise disposing of the animal.

H. The court shall not grant a mutual order of protection. If opposing parties separately file verified petitions for an order of protection, the courts after consultation between the judges involved may consolidate the petitions of the opposing parties for hearing. This does not prohibit a court from issuing cross orders of protection.

I. After granting an order of protection, the court shall provide the order to a law enforcement agency or a constable as set forth in subsection J of this section for service or to an entity that is authorized in subsection K of this section to serve process. The agency or entity serving the order shall provide confirmation of service to the plaintiff as soon as practicable. If service of an order cannot be completed within fifteen days after the agency or entity receives the order, the agency or entity that is attempting service shall notify the plaintiff and continue to attempt service. This notification may be completed by a victim notification system, if available.

J. If the order of protection is provided to a law enforcement agency or a constable, service of an order of protection is as follows:

1. For each order of protection that is issued by a municipal court, if the defendant can be served within that city or town, the order shall be served by the law enforcement agency of that city or town. If the order can be served in another city or town, the order shall be served by the law enforcement agency of that city or town.  If the order cannot be served within a city or town, the order shall be served by the sheriff or constable of the county in which the defendant can be served.

2. For each order of protection that is issued by a justice of the peace, the order of protection shall be served by the sheriff or constable of the county in which the defendant can be served or by a municipal law enforcement agency.

3. For each order of protection that is issued by a superior court judge or commissioner, the order of protection shall by served by the sheriff or constable of the county where the defendant can be served.

K. In addition to persons authorized to serve process pursuant to rule 4(d) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure, a peace officer or a correctional officer as defined in section 41-1661 who is acting in the officer's official capacity may serve an order of protection that is issued pursuant to this section.  Service of the order of protection has priority over other service of process that does not involve an immediate threat to the safety of a person.

L. At any time during the period during which the order is in effect, a party who is under an order of protection or who is restrained from contacting the other party is entitled to one hearing on written request.  No fee may be charged for requesting a hearing.  A hearing that is requested by a party who is under an order of protection or who is restrained from contacting the other party shall be held within ten days from the date requested unless the court finds good cause to continue the hearing. If exclusive use of the home is awarded, the hearing shall be held within five days from the date requested. The hearing shall be held at the earliest possible time. An ex parte order that is issued under this section shall state on its face that the defendant is entitled to a hearing on written request and shall include the name and address of the judicial office where the request may be filed. After the hearing, the court may modify, quash or continue the order. If the exclusive use of the home is awarded to the party, the court, on written request of a party, may hold additional hearings at any time if there is a change in circumstances related to the primary residence.

M. The order shall include the following statement:

Warning

This is an official court order. If you disobey this order, you will be subject to arrest and prosecution for the crime of interfering with judicial proceedings and any other crime you may have committed in disobeying this order.

N. An order of protection that is not served on the defendant within one year after the date that the order is issued expires. An order is effective on the defendant on service of a copy of the order and petition. An order expires two years after service on the defendant. A modified order is effective on service and expires two years after service of the initial order and petition.

O. A supplemental information form that is used by the court or a law enforcement agency solely for the purposes of service of process on the defendant and that contains information provided by the plaintiff is confidential.

P. Each affidavit, declaration, acceptance or return of service shall be filed as soon as practicable but not later than seventy-two hours, excluding weekends and holidays, with the clerk of the issuing court or as otherwise required by court rule. This filing shall be completed in person, electronically or by fax.

Q. The supreme court shall maintain a central repository for orders of protection.  Within twenty-four hours after the affidavit, declaration, acceptance or return of service has been filed, excluding weekends and holidays, the court from which the order or any modified order was issued shall enter the order and proof of service into the supreme court's central repository for orders of protection. The supreme court shall register the order with the national crime information center. The effectiveness of an order does not depend on its registration, and for enforcement purposes pursuant to section 13-2810, a copy of an order of the court, whether or not registered, is presumed to be a valid existing order of the court for a period of two years from the date of service of the order on the defendant.

R. A peace officer, with or without a warrant, may arrest a person if the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person has violated section 13-2810 by disobeying or resisting an order that is issued in any jurisdiction in this state pursuant to this section, whether or not such violation occurred in the presence of the officer. Criminal violations of an order issued pursuant to this section shall be referred to an appropriate law enforcement agency. The provisions for release under section 13-3883, subsection A, paragraph 4 and section 13-3903 do not apply to an arrest made pursuant to this section.  For the purposes of this section, any court in this state has jurisdiction to enforce a valid order of protection that is issued in this state and that has been violated in any jurisdiction in this state.

S. A person who is arrested pursuant to subsection R of this section may be released from custody in accordance with the Arizona rules of criminal procedure or any other applicable statute. An order for release, with or without an appearance bond, shall include pretrial release conditions that are necessary to provide for the protection of the alleged victim and other specifically designated persons and may provide for any other additional conditions that the court deems appropriate, including participation in any counseling programs available to the defendant. The agency with custody of the defendant shall make reasonable efforts to contact the victim and other specifically designated persons in the order of protection, if known to the custodial agency, who requested notification immediately on release of the arrested person from custody.

T. The remedies provided in this section for enforcement of the orders of the court are in addition to any other civil and criminal remedies available. The superior court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to issue orders of protection in all cases if it appears from the petition that an action for maternity or paternity, annulment, legal separation or dissolution of marriage is pending between the parties.  A municipal court or justice court shall not issue an order of protection if it appears from the petition that an action for maternity or paternity, annulment, legal separation or dissolution of marriage is pending between the parties. After issuance of an order of protection, if the municipal court or justice court determines that an action for maternity or paternity, annulment, legal separation or dissolution of marriage is pending between the parties, the municipal court or justice court shall stop further proceedings in the action and forward all papers, together with a certified copy of docket entries or any other record in the action, to the superior court where they shall be docketed in the pending superior court action and shall proceed as though the petition for an order of protection had been originally brought in the superior court. Notwithstanding any other law and unless prohibited by an order of the superior court, a municipal court or justice court may hold a hearing on all matters relating to its ex parte order of protection if the hearing was requested before receiving written notice of the pending superior court action. No order of protection shall be invalid or determined to be ineffective merely because it was issued by a lower court at a time when an action for maternity or paternity, annulment, legal separation or dissolution of marriage was pending in a higher court. After a hearing with notice to the affected party, the court may enter an order requiring any party to pay the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney fees, if any. An order that is entered by a justice court or municipal court after a hearing pursuant to this section may be appealed to the superior court as provided in title 22, chapter 2, article 4, section 22-425, subsection B and the superior court rules of civil appellate procedure without regard to an amount in controversy. No fee may be charged to either party for filing an appeal.  For the purposes of this subsection, "pending" means, with respect to an action for annulment, legal separation or dissolution of marriage or for maternity or paternity, either that:

1. An action has been commenced but a final judgment, decree or order has not been entered.

2. A post-decree proceeding has been commenced but a judgment, decree or order finally determining the proceeding has not been entered.

Before issuing a warrant, the magistrate may examine on oath the person or persons seeking the warrant, and any witnesses produced, and must take his affidavit, or their affidavits, in writing and cause the affidavit to be subscribed by the party or parties making the affidavit.

#### Section 13-3915. Issuance; form of warrant; duplicate original warrant; telefacsimile

A. If the magistrate is satisfied that probable cause for the issuance of the warrant exists, the magistrate shall issue a search warrant commanding a search by any peace officer of the person or place specified, for the items described.

County of ___________________, state of Arizona.

To any peace officer in the state of Arizona:

Proof by affidavit having been this day made before me by (naming every person whose affidavit has been taken) there is probable cause for believing that (stating the grounds of the application) according to section 13-3912, you are therefore commanded in the daytime (or in the night, as the case may be, according to section 13-3917) to make a search of (naming persons, buildings, premises or vehicles, describing each with reasonable particularity) for the following property, persons or things: (describing such with reasonable particularity), and if you find such or any part thereof, to retain such in your custody subject to section 13-3920.

B. If a party in a criminal proceeding seeks to exclude evidence from the trier of fact because of the conduct of a peace officer in obtaining the evidence, the proponent of the evidence may urge that the peace officer's conduct was taken in a reasonable, good faith belief that the conduct was proper and that the evidence discovered should not be kept from the trier of fact if otherwise admissible.

C. The trial court shall not suppress evidence that is otherwise admissible in a criminal proceeding if the court determines that the evidence was seized by a peace officer as a result of a good faith mistake or technical violation.

D. This section does not limit the enforcement of any appropriate civil remedy or criminal penalty in actions pursuant to other provisions of law against any individual or government entity found to have conducted an unreasonable search or seizure.

D. Except as provided in subsection A of this section, a person who is in custody shall not be admitted to bail if the person is charged with a felony offense and the state certifies by motion and the court finds after a hearing on the matter that there is clear and convincing evidence that the person charged poses a substantial danger to another person or the community or engaged in conduct constituting a violent offense, that no condition or combination of conditions of release may be imposed that will reasonably assure the safety of the other person or the community and that the proof is evident or the presumption great that the person committed the offense for which the person is charged.  For the purposes of this subsection, "violent offense" means either of the following:

1. A dangerous crime against children.

2. Terrorism.

E. On oral motion of the state, the court shall order the hearing required by subsection D of this section at or within twenty-four hours of the initial appearance unless the person who is subject to detention or the state moves for a continuance.  A continuance that is granted on the motion of the person shall not exceed five calendar days unless there are extenuating circumstances.  A continuance on the motion of the state shall be granted on good cause shown and shall not exceed twenty-four hours.  The prosecutor shall provide reasonable notice and an opportunity for victims and witnesses to be present and heard at any hearing.  The person may be detained pending the hearing. The person is entitled to representation by counsel and is entitled to present information by proffer or otherwise, to testify and to present witnesses in the person's own behalf.  Testimony of the person charged that is given during the hearing shall not be admissible on the issue of guilt in any subsequent judicial proceeding, except as it might relate to the compliance with or violation of any condition of release subsequently imposed or the imposition of appropriate sentence or in perjury proceedings, or for the purposes of impeachment.  The case of the person shall be placed on an expedited calendar and, consistent with the sound administration of justice, the person's trial shall be given priority.  The person may be admitted to bail in accordance with the Arizona rules of criminal procedure whenever a judicial officer finds that a subsequent event has eliminated the basis for detention.

F. The finding of an indictment or the filing of an information does not add to the strength of the proof or the presumption to be drawn.

G. In a hearing pursuant to subsection D of this section, proof that the person is a criminal street gang member may give rise to the inference that the person poses a substantial danger to another person or the community and that no condition or combination of conditions of release may be imposed that will reasonably assure the safety of the other person or the community.

#### Section 13-4013. Counsel assigned in criminal proceeding or insanity hearings; investigators and expert witnesses; compensation

A. If counsel is appointed by the court and represents the defendant in either a criminal proceeding or insanity hearing, counsel shall be paid by the county in which the court presides, except that in those matters in which a public defender is appointed, no compensation shall be paid by the county.

C. Compensation for investigators and expert witnesses who are appointed pursuant to subsection B of this section shall be at such rates as the county contracts for such services.  If a necessary expert witness represents a discipline or has a skill that is not then the subject of a county contract, the county may either promptly procure those services pursuant to section 11-254.01 or ask the court to establish a reasonable fee for that witness.  If no investigator or expert witness who is under contract with the county to provide services is available and the defendant is unable to obtain such services at the county rate, the court shall establish a reasonable fee for the expert witness or investigator providing the service.

### Article 17 - Insanity or Pregnancy of Person Under Death Sentence

#### Section 13-4021. Competency to be executed; definition

A. A person who is sentenced to death shall not be executed as long as he is mentally incompetent to be executed.

B. As used in this article, "mentally incompetent to be executed" means that due to a mental disease or defect a person who is sentenced to death is presently unaware that he is to be punished for the crime of murder or that he is unaware that the impending punishment for that crime is death.

#### Section 13-4022. Determining competency

A. If after a sentence of death is imposed the director of the state department of corrections, the prisoner's attorney or an attorney for the state has good reason to believe that the prisoner may be mentally incompetent to be executed, the director, the prisoner's attorney or an attorney for the state may file a motion in the superior court in the county in which the prisoner is located setting forth the facts relating to the prisoner's conviction and sentence and the facts giving rise to the belief that the prisoner may be mentally incompetent to be executed and requesting the court to order that the prisoner be examined for mental competency to be executed.

B. A stay of execution may not be granted by the superior court on the filing of a motion for examination of competency. If a stay is desired before the superior court rules on the motion, an application for a stay shall be submitted to the Arizona supreme court.

C. On receipt of a motion for examination of competency, the superior court shall determine if the motion is timely, as prescribed by section 13-4024, and presents reasonable grounds for the requested examination. If the motion is timely and presents reasonable grounds for the requested examination, the court shall appoint experts pursuant to the Arizona rules of criminal procedure. The appointed experts shall make copies of their reports available to all of the parties. The experts' reports shall indicate whether the prisoner suffers from a mental disorder, illness, defect or disability such that the prisoner is incompetent to be executed and would benefit from competency restoration treatment. The parties shall also disclose to the appointed experts and to each other the names and addresses of any other previously undisclosed mental health experts who have examined the prisoner and the results of the examinations.

D. The court may order the prisoner to submit to physical, neurological, psychological or other examinations or evaluations that are reasonably necessary to adequately determine the prisoner's mental competency to be executed. A prisoner who is subject to an examination or evaluation for mental competency to be executed waives all privileges concerning information relevant to the competency determination. The prisoner shall submit to and cooperate in all examinations or evaluations ordered by the court, regardless of which party appointed the mental health experts. If the prisoner refuses to be examined by the state's mental health experts, the court shall not consider any expert evidence offered by the prisoner concerning the prisoner's competency. Evidence obtained under this article is not admissible at any proceeding to determine guilt or innocence unless the defendant presents evidence intended to rebut the presumption of sanity or otherwise consents to admission of the evidence.

E. After the examinations are completed, the court may conduct a hearing to determine the prisoner's competency to be executed. At the hearing, all the parties may present evidence, cross-examine witnesses and present argument or by stipulation may submit the matter for the court's determination on the basis of the experts' reports or other evidence.

F. Prisoners who are sentenced to death are presumed competent to be executed. A prisoner may be found incompetent to be executed only on clear and convincing evidence of incompetency.

G. The superior court shall specifically state its findings on the record. If the court finds that the prisoner is competent, the director of the state department of corrections shall execute the judgment as specified in the warrant. If the court finds that the prisoner is incompetent, the court shall suspend the execution and shall immediately transmit a copy of its order to the supreme court. If the prisoner is incompetent to be executed, the court shall determine whether the prisoner suffers from a mental disorder, illness, defect or disability and shall order competency restoration treatment. The prisoner shall remain in the custody of the state department of corrections until the time for review has expired or a supreme court review is completed. If no review is sought or the supreme court upholds the finding of incompetency to be executed, the director of the state department of corrections shall transfer the prisoner to a licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections for competency restoration treatment. The prisoner shall remain confined in the licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections until the prisoner becomes competent to be executed.

H. Pursuant to subsection G of this section, the department of health services shall provide competency restoration treatment, including prescribing medication, to a prisoner found incompetent to be executed. The person who supervises the treatment of a prisoner found incompetent to be executed shall submit a written report to the court, the attorney general and the prisoner's attorney when the person believes the prisoner is competent to be executed. The written report shall include at least the following information:

1. The name of each mental health expert who examines the prisoner.

2. The description of the nature, content, extent and results of the examination and any tests conducted.

3. The facts on which the findings are based.

4. An opinion as to the prisoner's competency to be executed.

I. Within five days after the superior court grants or denies a motion for examination or rules whether the prisoner is competent, a party may file with the Arizona supreme court a petition for special action to obtain review of the superior court's decision.

J. The clerk of the court shall prepare a statement of the costs incurred by the county. The judge shall certify the statement and shall forward it to the governor for approval. After approval, the governor shall order that the costs be paid to the county treasurer in the county in which the hearing was held from monies appropriated to the state department of corrections.

#### Section 13-4023. Recovery of competency

A. Within sixty days after a prisoner is committed for restoration to competency treatment, the chief medical officer of the state hospital shall file with the superior court a report setting forth the treatment being provided, the status of the prisoner and the prognosis as to when the prisoner will be competent. The chief medical officer shall provide copies of the report to all of the parties and to the Arizona supreme court. The chief medical officer shall update the report every sixty days until the prisoner is determined to be competent to be executed.

B. After a prisoner recovers competency to be executed, the chief medical officer of the state hospital shall certify to the Arizona supreme court that the prisoner is competent. The Arizona supreme court shall order that the execution be conducted according to the original warrant, if unexpired, or shall issue a new warrant appointing a time for execution of the judgment.

C. After a prisoner recovers competency and within ten days after a warrant is issued, the superior court shall appoint psychological experts pursuant to rule 11.3, Arizona rules of criminal procedure to assess the prisoner's competency to be executed.  After considering the written opinions of the appointed experts, if the superior court believes that there is a significant question about the prisoner's competency to be executed, the superior court shall conduct a competency hearing to address that issue.  If the prisoner and the state agree, the superior court may determine the issue of competency without a hearing and based on the submitted reports.

D. On the request of a party, the superior court may appoint psychological experts after a prisoner's competency has been certified and before a warrant has been issued.

E. The prisoner may waive the appointment of experts pursuant to this section.

F. Within five days after the superior court determines a prisoner's competency to be executed, a party may file with the supreme court a petition for special action to obtain review of the superior court's decision.

G. The costs incurred by the county in appointing experts under this section shall be paid pursuant to section 13-4022.

 

 

#### Section 13-4024. Untimely or successive motions

A. A motion for an examination under section 13-4022 that is filed fewer than twenty days before a scheduled execution is untimely and shall not be considered by the court unless it is accompanied by both of the following:

1. At least one affidavit from a licensed physician or licensed psychologist who has examined the prisoner that states the physician's or psychologist's opinion that the prisoner is not competent to be executed.

2. A statement that establishes good cause for the failure to file the motion in a timely manner.

B. A motion that is filed fewer than twenty days before a scheduled execution shall be served on the state department of corrections and the attorney representing the state in the criminal proceeding. The filing of an untimely motion constitutes consent by the prisoner to be evaluated by a mental health expert who is designated by the state department of corrections. The mental health expert shall report the expert's findings to the superior court and the parties as expediently as practicable. If the prisoner fails to cooperate with an evaluation, the court shall dismiss the motion.

C. If the superior court denies a motion for an examination under section 13-4022 or determines that the prisoner is competent for execution, no further hearings on competency may be granted unless the successive motion is accompanied by an affidavit from a physician who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 13 or 17 or a psychologist who is licensed pursuant to title 32, chapter 19.1 and who has examined the prisoner and the affidavit shows a substantial change of circumstances since the previous motion for hearing was denied or the prior determination of competency was made and the showing is sufficient to raise a significant question about the prisoner's competency to be executed.

 

 

#### Section 13-4025. Procedure upon discovery that prisoner under death sentence may be pregnant; examination

If, after delivery to the superintendent of the state prison of a female prisoner under a sentence of death, there is reason at any time prior to execution of such sentence to believe that she is pregnant, the superintendent shall give notice of such fact to the county attorney of the county in which the prison is located, who shall immediately file in the superior court of such county a petition, setting forth the conviction and sentence and the fact that the prisoner is believed to be pregnant, and requesting that the question of pregnancy be determined. The court shall immediately summon three disinterested physicians to inquire into the alleged pregnancy and to report thereon. If the court, after hearing the report of the physicians, decides that the defendant is pregnant, it shall make a written finding thereof and enter it upon the minutes.

#### Section 13-4026. Proceedings subsequent to examination for pregnancy

A. If it is determined that the female prisoner is not pregnant, the superintendent shall execute the sentence.

B. If it is determined that she is pregnant, the superintendent shall suspend the execution of the sentence and transmit a certified copy of the finding to the governor.

C. When the governor receives from the superintendent a certificate that the defendant is no longer pregnant, he shall issue to the superintendent his warrant, appointing a day for the execution of the sentence.

### Article 18 - Appeals

1. A petition is timely filed.

2. If a petition is not filed, a notice is timely filed stating that counsel has reviewed the record and found no meritorious claim.

G. The trial court shall compensate appointed counsel from county funds.

4. The county attorney or attorney general reports to the presiding judge of the superior court the fact of the issuance of the subpoena within ten days following its issuance.

D.

B. If at a hearing the judge determines that the witness is material and necessary, that it will not cause undue hardship to the witness to be compelled to attend and testify in the prosecution or a grand jury investigation in the other state, and that the laws of the state in which the prosecution is pending, or grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence, will give to him protection from arrest and the service of civil and criminal process, he shall issue a summons, with a copy of the certificate attached, directing the witness to attend and testify in the court where the prosecution is pending, or where a grand jury investigation has commenced or is about to commence at a time and place specified in the summons.

#### Section 13-4133. Effect of defect in form

If a person is committed or is in the custody of any officer on any charge by virtue of a warrant or commitment of a justice of the peace, such person shall not be discharged from imprisonment or custody on the ground of a mere defect of form in the warrant or commitment.

#### Section 13-4134. Defective process or commitment; re-examination

If it appears to the court or judge that the party is guilty of a criminal offense, or should not be discharged, the court or judge, although the charge is defectively set forth in the process or warrant of commitment, shall cause the witnesses to be subpoenaed to attend at the time ordered to testify before such court or judge. Upon the examination, the court shall discharge the prisoner, admit him to bail, if the offense is bailable, or recommit him to custody.

#### Section 13-4135. Writ to admit to bail

When a person is imprisoned or detained in custody on any criminal charge for want of bail, such person shall be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus for the purpose of giving bail, upon averring that fact in his petition and without alleging that he is illegally confined. The court or judge may take a recognizance from such person as in other cases and file the recognizance in the proper court without delay.

#### Section 13-4136. Remand of prisoner

A. If a party brought before the court or judge on the return of the writ, is not entitled to discharge or to bail, the court or judge shall remand him to the custody or restraint from which he is taken, if the person under whose custody or restraint he was is legally entitled thereto.

#### Section 13-4137. Custody pending judgment

Until judgment is given on the return, the court or judge may commit the party to the custody of the sheriff of the county or place him in such care, or under such custody, as his age or circumstances may require.

#### Section 13-4138. Disobedience of writ for defect of form

No writ of habeas corpus shall be disobeyed for defect of form, if it sufficiently appears therefrom who has custody of, or who restrains the party imprisoned or restrained, the officer or person detaining him, and the court or judge before whom he is to be brought.

#### Section 13-4139. Finality of discharge; exceptions

A person who has been discharged by order of the court or judge upon habeas corpus shall not be again imprisoned, restrained or kept in custody for the same cause, except:

1. If he was discharged from custody on a criminal charge, and is afterwards committed for the same offense by legal order or process.

2. If, after discharge for defect of proof, or for any defect in process, warrant or commitment, the prisoner is again arrested on sufficient proof and committed by legal process for the same offense.

#### Section 13-4140. Warrant for immediate production of person restrained or restraining; grounds

A. When it appears from a petition, supported by satisfactory proof or affidavit, presented to a court or judge authorized to grant a writ of habeas corpus, that a person is illegally held in custody, confinement or restraint, and that there is good reason to believe that such person will be taken from the jurisdiction of the court or judge to whom the petition is made, or that the person will suffer some irreparable injury before compliance with a writ of habeas corpus can be enforced, the court or judge may cause a warrant to be issued reciting the facts, and directed to the sheriff or any constable of the county, commanding such officer to take the person thus held in custody, confinement or restraint, and forthwith bring him before the court or judge to be dealt with according to law.

B. The court or judge may also insert in the warrant a command for apprehension of the person charged with such illegal detention and restraint.

#### Section 13-4141. Execution of warrant; return and hearing

A. The officer to whom the warrant authorized by section 13-4140 is delivered shall execute the warrant by bringing the person therein named before the court or judge who ordered the issuance of such warrant.

B. The person alleged to have such party under illegal confinement or restraint may make return to the warrant as in the case of a writ of habeas corpus, and the same proceedings shall be had thereupon as upon a return to such writ.

#### Section 13-4142. Issuance, service and return of writ or process; time; manner; duty of clerk

A. Any writ or process authorized by this article may be issued and served on any day or at any time.

B. The writs, processes, warrants and subpoenas shall be issued by the clerk of the court, and, except subpoenas, sealed with the seal of such court, and shall be served and returned forthwith unless the court or judge specifies a particular time for the return. When the writs or processes are made returnable before a judge, they shall be returned before him at the county seat and there heard and determined.

#### Section 13-4143. Charging fee in habeas corpus prohibited

No fee or compensation of any kind shall be charged or received by any officer for duties performed or services rendered in habeas corpus proceedings.

#### Section 13-4144. Form of writ

(or immediately after the receipt of this writ), to do and receive what shall then and there be considered concerning the said C.D. And have you then and there this writ. Witness, etc."

#### Section 13-4145. Disobedience of command of writ; classification

An officer or person to whom a writ of habeas corpus is directed, who, after service thereof, neglects or refuses to obey the command thereof, or who, either solely or as a member of a court, knowingly and unlawfully recommits, imprisons or restrains of his liberty, for the same cause, any person who has been discharged upon a writ of habeas corpus, is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.

#### Section 13-4147. Avoidance of command of writ; classification

A person having in his custody, or under his restraint or power, any person for whom a writ of habeas corpus has been issued, who, with intent to elude the service of such writ, or to avoid the effect thereof, transfers such person to the custody of another, or places him under the power or control of another, or conceals or changes the place of his confinement or restraint or removes him without the jurisdiction of the court or judge issuing the writ, is guilty of a class 1 misdemeanor.

1. The period of time that a person who was convicted of a felony sexual offense or homicide remains incarcerated for that offense or until the completion of the person's supervised release.

2. A cold case, fifty-five years or until a person is convicted of the crime and remains incarcerated or under supervised release for that offense.

C. Evidence retained pursuant to this section shall be made available for deoxyribonucleic acid testing pursuant to section 13-4240.

D. The government entity that investigates the crime may establish procedures for retaining probative samples of the biological evidence and disposing of bulk evidence that do not affect the suitability of the probative sample for deoxyribonucleic acid testing.  The government entity responsible for retaining the samples shall obtain approval from the county attorney or attorney general before disposal of any bulk evidence. Before the disposal of any bulk evidence, reasonable efforts shall be made to provide written notice to the victim.

E. This section does not preclude a governmental entity from disposing of evidence in a case in which a conviction has been obtained after the expiration of the defendant's sentence.  Under any other circumstance, the governmental entity may dispose of physical evidence after the conclusion of the convicted defendant's direct appeal and first postconviction relief proceeding or after the time for initiating the direct appeal and first postconviction relief proceeding has expired, with the agreement of the county attorney or the attorney general and then, upon written notice to the defendant, any counsel of record and the victim if no other law requires that biological evidence be preserved or retained.

### Article 29 - Post-Conviction Relief

#### Section 13-4231. Scope of post-conviction relief

Subject to the limitations of section 13-4232, any person who has been convicted of or sentenced for a criminal offense may, without payment of any fee, institute a proceeding to secure appropriate relief on any of the following grounds:

1. The conviction or the sentence was in violation of the Constitution of the United States or of this state.

2. The court was without jurisdiction to render judgment or to impose sentence.

3. The sentence imposed exceeded the maximum authorized by law or is otherwise not in accordance with the sentence authorized by law.

4. The person is being held in custody after his sentence has expired.

5. Newly discovered material facts probably exist and that the facts probably would have changed the verdict or sentence. Newly discovered material facts exist if:

(a) The newly discovered material facts were discovered after the trial.

(b) The defendant exercised due diligence in securing the newly discovered material facts.

(c) The newly discovered material facts are not merely cumulative or used solely for impeachment, unless the impeachment evidence substantially undermines testimony which was of critical significance at trial such that the evidence probably would have changed the verdict or sentence.

6. The defendant's failure to appeal from the judgment or sentence, or both, within the prescribed time was without fault on his part.

7. There has been a significant change in the law that if determined to apply to the defendant's case would probably overturn the defendant's conviction or sentence.

#### Section 13-4232. Preclusion of post-conviction relief; exceptions; proof

A. A defendant is precluded from relief under this article based on any ground:

1. Still raisable on direct appeal or on a post-trial motion.

2. Finally adjudicated on the merits on appeal or in any previous collateral proceeding.

3. That was waived at trial, on appeal or in any previous collateral proceeding.

B. This section does not apply to claims for relief pursuant to section 13-4231, paragraph 4, 5, 6 or 7. If a claim under section 13-4231, paragraph 4, 5, 6 or 7 is to be raised in a successive or untimely petition, the notice shall set forth the substance of the claim and the reasons for not raising the claim in the previous petition or in a timely manner. If the notice does not state meritorious reasons substantiating the claim and why the claim was not stated in the previous petition or in a timely manner, the proceeding shall be summarily dismissed.

C. Except for summary dismissals pursuant to subsection B of this section, the state shall plead and prove any ground of preclusion by a preponderance of the evidence. Though the state has the burden to plead and prove grounds of preclusion, any court on review of the record may determine and hold that an issue is precluded regardless of the state's failure to raise the preclusion issue.

#### Section 13-4233. Nature of proceeding and relation to other remedies

A proceeding pursuant to this article is a part of the original criminal action and not a separate action. It displaces and incorporates all trial court post-trial remedies except post-trial motions and habeas corpus. If a defendant applies for a writ of habeas corpus in a court having jurisdiction of his person attacking the validity of his conviction or sentence, that court pursuant to this article shall transfer the cause to the court where the defendant was convicted or sentenced and that court shall treat it as a petition for relief under this article and the procedures of this article apply.

#### Section 13-4234. Commencement of proceedings; notice; appointment of counsel for capital defendants; assignment of judge; stay

A. A proceeding is commenced by timely filing a notice of postconviction relief with the clerk of the court in which the conviction occurred. The clerk of the trial court shall provide notice forms for commencement of first and successive postconviction relief proceedings. The notice shall bear the caption of the original criminal action to which it pertains. The notice in successive postconviction relief proceedings shall comply with section 13-4232, subsection B. On receipt of the notice, the clerk of the trial court shall file a copy of the notice in the case file of each original action and promptly send copies to the defendant, the defendant's attorney, if known, the county attorney and the attorney general, noting the date and manner of sending the copies in the record. The state shall notify the victim on request.

B. If an appeal of the defendant's conviction or sentence, or both, is pending, the clerk, within five days after the filing of the notice for postconviction relief, shall send a copy of the notice to the appropriate appellate court, noting the date and manner of sending the copy in the record.

C. In noncapital cases, the notice shall be filed within ninety days after the judgment and sentence are entered or within thirty days after the order and mandate affirming the judgment and sentence is issued on direct appeal, whichever is later. A defendant has sixty days from the filing of the notice in which to file a petition. On the filing of a successive notice, a defendant has thirty days from the filing of the notice in which to file a petition.

D. In capital cases, on the issuance of a mandate affirming the defendant's conviction and sentence on direct appeal, the clerk of the supreme court expeditiously shall file a notice of postconviction relief with the trial court. On the first notice in capital cases, a defendant has sixty days from the filing of the notice in which to file a petition. The supreme court shall appoint counsel pursuant to section 13-4041, subsection B. All indigent state prisoners under a capital sentence are entitled to the appointment of counsel to represent them in state postconviction proceedings. A competent indigent defendant may reject the offer of counsel with an understanding of its legal consequence. On successive notice in capital cases, the trial court shall appoint the previous postconviction relief counsel of the capital defendant unless counsel is waived pursuant to section 13-4041, subsection D or good cause exists to appoint another qualified attorney pursuant to section 13-4041, subsection B. On the filing of a successive notice, a capital defendant or an appointed attorney has thirty days from the filing of the notice in which to file a petition.

E. A defendant who has pled guilty and who is precluded from filing a direct appeal pursuant to section 13-4033 may be granted an additional thirty day extension of time in which to file the petition if the defendant's counsel refuses to raise issues and leaves the defendant insufficient time to file a petition within the time limits.

F. On a specific and detailed showing of good cause, a defendant in a noncapital case may be granted up to a sixty day extension of time in which to file the petition. On a specific and detailed showing of good cause, a defendant in a capital case may be granted one thirty day extension of time in which to file the petition.

G. The time limits are jurisdictional, and an untimely filed notice or petition shall be dismissed with prejudice.

H. If the record of the trial proceeding has not been transcribed, the defendant may request on a form provided by the clerk of the superior court that the record be prepared. The court shall order that those portions of the record be prepared that it deems necessary to resolve the issues to be raised in the petition. The preparation of the record is a county expense if the defendant is indigent. The time for filing the petition is tolled from the time a request for the record is made until the record is prepared or the request is denied.

I. The proceeding shall be assigned to the sentencing judge if it is possible. If it appears that the sentencing judge's testimony is relevant, the sentencing judge shall transfer the case to another judge.

J. If the defendant has received a sentence of death and the supreme court has fixed the time for execution of the sentence, a stay of execution shall not be granted on the filing of a second or subsequent petition except on separate application for a stay to the supreme court setting forth with particularity those issues raised which are not precluded under section 13-4232. The warrant shall not be stayed to allow for the filing of a petition.

 

#### Section 13-4234.01. Post-conviction relief proceedings; request for extension; victim notification

A. In any post-conviction relief proceeding in a capital case in which an extension of the time to file a brief is requested, the victim, after filing a notice of appearance, has a right to respond to the request for extension within ten days after the filing of the request.

B. On the filing of a notice of appearance, the victim shall serve a copy on the state and the defendant.

C. The victim may exercise the right to respond through the state.

D. The party that requests the extension shall provide notice of the request to the victim in a manner prescribed by the court.

E. This section does not provide any party or the victim with a right to oral argument.

 

#### Section 13-4235. Contents of petition

The defendant shall include every ground known to the defendant for vacating, reducing, correcting or otherwise changing all judgments or sentences imposed and shall verify under oath that the petition contains all such grounds. Facts within the defendant's personal knowledge shall be noted separately from other allegations of fact and shall be under oath. Affidavits, records or other evidence currently available to the defendant supporting the allegations of the petition shall be attached to it. Legal citations and memoranda of points and authorities are required. Petitions which are incomplete shall be returned by the court to the defendant for completion. If the court does not receive the completed petition within thirty days after the defendant receives the incomplete petition, the court shall dismiss the proceeding with prejudice.

#### Section 13-4236. Additional pleadings; summary disposition; amendments

A. Forty-five days after the filing of the petition, the state shall file with the court a response. Affidavits, the record and other evidence that are available to the state and that contradict the allegations of the petition shall be attached to the response. On a showing of good cause, the state may be granted a thirty day extension in which to file a response. Additional extensions shall be granted only in extraordinary circumstances.

B. Within fifteen days after receipt of the response, the defendant may file a reply. Extensions shall be granted only in extraordinary circumstances.

C. The court shall review the petition within twenty days after the defendant's reply is due. On reviewing the petition, response, reply, files and records, and disregarding defects of form, the court shall identify all procedurally precluded claims under this article. If after identifying all precluded claims the court determines that no material issue of fact or law exists which would entitle the defendant to relief under this article and that no purpose would be served by any further proceedings, the court shall order the petition dismissed. If the court does not order the petition dismissed, the court shall set a hearing within thirty days on those claims that present a material issue of fact or law. If a hearing is ordered, the state shall notify the victim on request of the time and place of the hearing.

D. After the filing of a post-conviction relief petition, amendments are not permitted except by leave of the court on a showing of extraordinary circumstances.

#### Section 13-4237. Informal conference

The court at any time may hold an informal conference to expedite the proceeding, at which the defendant need not be present if he is represented by counsel who is present.

#### Section 13-4238. Evidentiary hearing

A. The defendant is entitled to a hearing to determine issues of material fact, with the right to be present and to subpoena witnesses. If facilities are available, the court may, in its discretion, order the hearing to be held at the place of confinement, giving at least fifteen days' notice to the officer in charge of the confinement facility. A verbatim record of the hearing shall be made.

B. The rules of evidence applicable in criminal proceedings shall apply, except that the defendant may be called to testify at the hearing.

C. The defendant has the burden of proving the allegations of fact by a preponderance of the evidence. If a constitutional defect is proven, the state has the burden of proving that the defect was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

D. The court shall rule within ten days after the hearing ends. If the court finds in favor of the defendant, it shall enter an appropriate order with respect to the conviction, sentence or detention, any further proceedings, including a new trial and conditions of release, and other matters that may be necessary and proper. The court shall make specific findings of fact and state expressly its conclusions of law relating to each issue presented.

#### Section 13-4239. Review

A. Any party aggrieved by a final decision of the trial court in these proceedings may, within fifteen days after the ruling of the court, move the court for a rehearing setting forth in detail the grounds for believing that the court erred. A response shall be filed within fifteen days after service of the motion on the adverse party. A reply, if any, shall be filed within ten days after service of the response. The filing of a motion for rehearing in the trial court is not a prerequisite to the filing of a petition for review pursuant to subsection C.

B. If the motion for rehearing is granted, the court may either amend its previous ruling without a hearing or grant a new hearing and then either amend or reaffirm its previous ruling. If the court amends its previous ruling, the court shall set forth its reasons for amending the previous ruling. The state shall notify the victim on request of any action that is taken by the court.

C. Within thirty days after the final decision of the trial court on the petition for post-conviction relief or motion for rehearing, an aggrieved party may petition the appellate court for review of the trial court's actions. A cross-petition for review may be filed with the clerk of the trial court within fifteen days after service of a petition for review. The petition or cross-petition shall be filed with the clerk of the trial court and shall set forth in detail the grounds for believing that the court erred. The filing of a motion for rehearing pursuant to subsection A does not limit the issues that may be raised in the petition or cross-petition for review. The failure to raise an issue that could be raised in the petition or cross-petition for review constitutes a waiver of appellate review of that issue. A response shall be filed within fifteen days and a reply shall be filed within ten days.

D. The form, contents and service for a post-conviction relief petition and cross-petition shall be as prescribed by rule 32.9 of the rules of criminal procedure.

E. A motion for rehearing or a petition for review that is filed pursuant to this section shall stay an order of the trial court issued in the post-conviction relief proceedings until final review is completed unless the trial court specifically orders otherwise. The state shall notify the victim on request of any action taken.

F. Within thirty days after the expiration of the time for filing the last reply, the record, including the trial court file, the reporter's transcript, the original and all copies of the petition and cross-petition for review, responses and replies shall be transmitted to the appellate court.

G. The appellate court may grant review and may order oral argument on the petition if deemed necessary and may issue such orders and grant such relief as it deems necessary and proper. The state shall notify the victim on request of any action taken by the appellate court.

H. The provisions that govern the filing of motions for reconsideration and petitions for review in criminal appeals that are set forth in rules 31.18 and 31.19, Arizona rules of criminal procedure, apply to and govern motions for reconsideration and petitions for review pursuant to rule 32, Arizona rules of criminal procedure.

I. When the matter is determined the clerk of the appellate court shall return the record to the appropriate clerk of the court for retention according to law.

A. At any time, a person who was convicted of and sentenced for a felony offense and who meets the requirements of this section may request the forensic deoxyribonucleic acid testing of any evidence that is in the possession or control of the court or the state, that is related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment of conviction, and that may contain biological evidence.

B. After notice to the prosecutor and an opportunity to respond, the court shall order deoxyribonucleic acid testing if the court finds that all of the following apply:

2. The evidence is still in existence and is in a condition that allows deoxyribonucleic acid testing to be conducted.

3. The evidence was not previously subjected to deoxyribonucleic acid testing or was not subjected to the testing that is now requested and that may resolve an issue not previously resolved by the previous testing.

C. After notice to the prosecutor and an opportunity to respond, the court may order deoxyribonucleic acid testing if the court finds that all of the following apply:

1. A reasonable probability exists that either:

(a) The petitioner’s verdict or sentence would have been more favorable if the results of deoxyribonucleic acid testing had been available at the trial leading to the judgment of conviction.

(b) Deoxyribonucleic acid testing will produce exculpatory evidence.

2. The evidence is still in existence and is in a condition that allows deoxyribonucleic acid testing to be conducted.

3. The evidence was not previously subjected to deoxyribonucleic acid testing or was not subjected to the testing that is now requested and that may resolve an issue not previously resolved by the previous testing.

#### Section 13-4241. Postconviction request for advanced forensic testing

A. At any time, a person who was convicted of and sentenced for a felony offense and who meets the requirements of this section may request that any evidence that is in the possession or control of the court or the state and that is related to the investigation or prosecution that resulted in the judgment of conviction either be:

The determinations shall be made ex parte unless real property is to be seized and subsection B of this section requires notice and an opportunity to appear.

D. In establishing probable cause for seizure, a rebuttable presumption exists that the property of any person is subject to forfeiture if the state establishes all of the following by clear and convincing evidence:

1. Conduct giving rise to forfeiture occurred.

2. The person acquired the property during the period of the conduct giving rise to forfeiture or within a reasonable time after that period.

3. There is no likely source for the property other than the conduct giving rise to forfeiture.

A. Within sixty days after making a seizure for forfeiture or simultaneously on filing a related criminal indictment, the state shall file a notice of pending forfeiture proceeding or return the property to the person from whom it was seized. A notice of pending forfeiture proceeding must include all of the following:

1. A description of the property seized.

2. The date and place of seizure of the property.

3. The name and address of the law enforcement agency making the seizure.

4. The specific statutory and factual grounds for the seizure.

B. If the property sought to be forfeited is real property, including fixtures, the attorney for the state may file a lis pendens or a notice of pending forfeiture with respect to the property with the county recorder of the county where the property is located, in addition to any lien provided by section 13-2314.02 without a filing fee or other charge.

C. A notice of pending forfeiture proceeding must be delivered as follows:

1. If the owner's or interest holder's name and current address are known, by either:

3. If the owner's or interest holder's address is not known, and is not on record as provided in paragraph 2 of this subsection, or if his interest is not known, by publication in one issue of a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the seizure occurs.

D. The notice of pending forfeiture proceeding must also be served on the person's attorney of record and all persons known or reasonably believed by the state to claim an interest in the property.

E. An owner of or interest holder in the property may file a claim against the property at any time within sixty days after the notice or sixty days before a criminal trial, whichever is later, requesting a hearing to adjudicate the validity of the claimed interest in the property.  An owner or interest holder may not be charged a filing fee or any other charge for filing the claim.  Copies of the claim shall be mailed to the seizing agency and to the attorney for the state.

F. The claim shall be signed by the claimant under penalty of perjury and shall set forth all of the following:

1. The caption of the proceeding as set forth on the notice of pending forfeiture or complaint and the name of the claimant.

2. The address at which the claimant will accept future mailings from the court or the attorney for the state.

3. The nature and extent of the claimant's interest in the property.

4. All facts supporting the claimant's claim in the property and its return to the claimant.

5. The precise relief sought.

#### Section 13-4308. Commencement of proceedings

A. The attorney for the state shall determine whether it is probable that the property is subject to forfeiture and, if so, may cause the commencement of further judicial forfeiture proceedings for which a notice of pending forfeiture has been filed and made by filing a complaint if a claim has been filed. If, on inquiry and examination, the attorney for the state determines that the proceedings probably cannot be sustained or that justice does not require the institution of such proceedings, the attorney for the state shall notify the seizing agency and immediately authorize the release of the seizure for forfeiture on the property or on any specified interest in it.

B. The state may not proceed with further forfeiture proceedings before a criminal conviction for an offense to which forfeiture applies unless no timely claim has been filed or a conviction is waived pursuant to this chapter.

C. If the state fails to proceed with further forfeiture proceedings within sixty days following a person's conviction for an offense to which forfeiture applies and a claim has been filed, such property shall be released from its seizure for forfeiture to an owner or interest holder, pending further proceedings pursuant to this chapter, which shall be commenced within seven years after actual discovery of the last act giving rise to forfeiture.

#### Section 13-4309. Postdeprivation hearing

A. After the seizure of property, the defendant in the related criminal matter or another person who claims an interest in the seized property, up to sixty days after the notice, may claim an interest in seized property by filing a motion with the superior court requesting an order for the release of the claimed property to the person's custody pending further forfeiture proceedings and orders pursuant to this chapter. A motion filed pursuant to this section must include facts to support the person's alleged interest in the property. The state may elect to not contest the motion and the release of the claimed property to the custody of the person who is claiming the interest in the seized property. The state may request that the court issue a protective order that preserves the availability of released property pending further forfeiture proceedings.

B. A person who makes a timely motion for the return of property has a right to a hearing on the motion before the resolution of any related criminal matter or forfeiture proceeding and within thirty days after the date that the motion is filed.

C. At least ten days before a hearing on a motion filed pursuant to this section, the state shall file an answer or responsive motion that includes the reasons why the state is entitled to retain possession of the property.

D. The court shall grant the claimant's motion if the court finds that any of the following applies:

1. It is likely that the final judgment will require the state to return the property to the claimant.

2. The property is not reasonably required to be held for evidentiary reasons.

3. The property is the only reasonable means for a defendant to pay for legal representation in a related criminal or forfeiture proceeding. This paragraph does not apply if the court finds by sufficient evidence, presented in a hearing on a motion, answer or responsive motion, that another person has filed a claim to the seized property and the other person is the victim, as defined in section 13-4401, of the alleged crime that gave rise to the forfeiture.

E. The court may order the return of money or property sufficient to obtain legal counsel but less than the total amount seized and the court may require an accounting.

F. In lieu of ordering the return of property, the court may order:

1. The state to give security or written assurance for satisfaction of any judgment, including damages, that may be rendered in a related forfeiture action.

2. Any other relief that the court deems to be just.

G. This section does not prevent either of the following:

1. The state from returning any property to the owner of the property.

2. The filing of a racketeering lien pursuant to section 13-2314.02 or a restitution lien pursuant to section 13-806.

#### Section 13-4310. Judicial forfeiture proceedings; damages

A. A person who claims an interest in seized property shall file an answer to the complaint of forfeiture within thirty days after service of the forfeiture complaint. The answer must include facts to support the claimant's alleged interest in the property. The clerk of court may not charge a person who claims ownership or to be an interest holder a filing fee or any charge for filing the answer.

B. A defendant convicted in any criminal proceeding shall be precluded from subsequently denying the essential allegations of the criminal offense of which he was convicted in any proceeding pursuant to this chapter. For the purposes of this chapter, a conviction may result from a verdict or plea including a no contest plea.

C. In any judicial forfeiture hearing, determination or other proceeding pursuant to this chapter, the applicant, petitioner or claimant must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that he is an owner of or interest holder in the property seized for forfeiture before other evidence is taken. The burden of proving the standing of the claimant and the existence of the exemption is on the claimant or party raising the claim, and it is not necessary to negate the standing of any claimant or the existence of any exemption in any notice, application, complaint, information or indictment.

D. In hearings and determinations pursuant to this chapter the law of evidence relating to civil actions applies equally to all parties, including the state, an applicant, a petitioner, a claimant and a defendant, on all issues required to be established by a preponderance of the evidence or clear and convincing evidence.

E. The court shall enter a judgment of forfeiture and the seized property shall be forfeited to the state if the state proves by clear and convincing evidence that:

1. The property is subject to forfeiture.

2. The criminal prosecution related to the seized property resulted in a conviction or the court waived the requirement for a conviction pursuant to section 13-4304.

3. There is no innocent owner or third-party interest holder to whom the property should be delivered.

4. The value of the property to be forfeited does not unreasonably exceed:

(a) The pecuniary gain derived or sought to be derived by the crime.

(b) The pecuniary loss caused or sought to be caused by the crime.

(c) The value of the convicted owner's interest in the property.

F. A person is not jointly and severally liable for orders for forfeiture of another person's property. If ownership of property is unclear, a court may order each person to forfeit the person's property on a pro rata basis or by another means that the court deems equitable.

G. All property, including all interests in such property, declared forfeited under this title vests in this state on the commission of the act or omission giving rise to forfeiture under this title together with the proceeds of the property after such time. Any property or proceeds subsequently transferred to any person are subject to forfeiture and thereafter shall be ordered forfeited if the state proves by clear and convincing evidence that the transferee:

1. Had actual knowledge that the property was subject to forfeiture.

2. Was not a bona fide purchaser for value not knowingly taking part in an illegal transaction.

H. On the motion of a party and after notice to any persons who are known to have an interest in the property and an opportunity to be heard, the court may order property that has been seized for forfeiture sold, leased, rented or operated to satisfy an interest of any interest holder who has timely filed a proper claim or to preserve the interests of any party. The court may order a sale or any other disposition of the property if the property may perish, waste, be foreclosed on or otherwise be significantly reduced in value or if the expenses of maintaining the property are or will become greater than its fair market value. If the court orders a sale, the court shall designate a third party or state property manager to dispose of the property by public sale or other commercially reasonable method and shall distribute the proceeds in the following order of priority:

1. Payment of reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the sale.

2. Satisfaction of exempt interests in the order of their priority.

3. Preservation of the balance, if any, in the actual or constructive custody of the court in an interest bearing account, subject to further proceedings under this chapter.

I. If the property is disposed of pursuant to subsection H of this section, a successful claimant may apply to the court for actual monetary damages suffered, if any, as a result of the disposal of the property, but the state, a political subdivision of the state, or an officer, employee or agent of any of them shall not be liable under this chapter for incidental or consequential damages or for damages either:

1. That could have been avoided if the claimant had made full and immediate disclosure to the attorney for the state of facts or evidence known or available to the claimant.

2. In excess of the fair market value of the property seized for forfeiture at the time of its seizure plus interest from the time of its seizure for forfeiture.

J. No person claiming to be an owner of or interest holder in property seized for forfeiture under this chapter may commence or maintain any action against the state concerning the validity of the alleged interest other than as provided in this chapter.

K. An injured person may submit a request for compensation from forfeited property to the court at any time before the earlier of the entry of a final judgment or an application for an order of the forfeiture of the property, or if a hearing pursuant to subsections M, N and O of this section is held, not less than thirty days before the hearing.  The request shall be signed by the requestor under penalty of perjury and shall set forth all of the following:

1. The caption of the proceeding as set forth on the notice of pending forfeiture or complaint and the name of the requestor.

2. The address at which the requestor will accept future mailings from the court or parties to the action.

3. The property subject to forfeiture from which the requestor seeks compensation.

4. The nature of the economic loss sustained by the requestor.

5. All facts supporting each such assertion.

6. Any additional facts supporting the request.

7. The amount of economic loss that the requestor seeks compensation for.

L. If a proper request for compensation from forfeited property is timely filed, the court shall hold a hearing to establish whether there is a factual basis for the request. The requestor has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of evidence that the requestor is an injured person who sustained economic loss.

M. The hearing on the claim, to the extent practicable and consistent with the interest of justice, shall be held sixty days after all parties have complied with the disclosure required by rule 26.1, Arizona rules of civil procedure. The court may consolidate the hearing on the claim with a hearing on any other claim concerning the same property.

N. At the hearing, the claimant may testify, present evidence and witnesses on the claimant's own behalf and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.  The state may present evidence and witnesses and cross-examine witnesses who appear at the hearing.

O. At the hearing, the state has the burden of establishing by clear and convincing evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture under section 13-4304. Any claimant who has previously established by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant is an owner of or interest holder in the property has the burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant's interest in the property is exempt from forfeiture under section 13-4304.

P. After a hearing:

1. The court shall order an interest in property returned or conveyed to a claimant, if any, who has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the claimant is an owner of or interest holder in the property if either of the following applies:

(a) The state has failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the interest is subject to forfeiture under section 13-4304.

(b) The claimant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the interest is exempt from forfeiture under section 13-4304.

2. The court shall order all other property, including all interests in the property, forfeited to this state and proceed pursuant to sections 13-4314 and 13-4315.

3. If the court finds that a requestor is an injured person the court shall determine the amount of the injured person's economic loss caused by the conduct giving rise to the forfeiture of the designated property and shall require the following:

(a) If the designated property is not contraband and is not altered or designed for use in conduct giving rise to forfeiture, the attorney for the state shall sell the property as provided in section 13-4315, subsection A, paragraph 2 and shall apply the resulting balance to compensate the injured person's economic loss in the amount found by the court.

(b) If the balance is insufficient to compensate the economic loss of all injured persons the attorney for the state shall distribute the balance among the injured persons according to a method determined by the court.

(c) After compensating all injured persons, the attorney for the state shall transmit ten percent of the remaining balance, if any, to the state treasurer for deposit in the victim compensation and assistance fund established by section 41-2407.

(d) The attorney for the state shall deposit the remainder of the balance, if any, in an appropriate anti-racketeering revolving fund established by section 13-2314.01 or 13-2314.03.

#### Section 13-4311. Judicial in rem forfeiture proceedings

A. If a forfeiture is authorized by law, it may be ordered by a court on an action in rem brought by the state pursuant to a notice of pending forfeiture or a verified complaint for forfeiture. The state may serve the complaint in the manner provided by section 13-4307 or by the Arizona rules of civil procedure.

B. Judicial in rem forfeiture proceedings are in the nature of an action in rem and are governed by the Arizona rules of civil procedure unless a different procedure is provided by law.  A civil in rem action may be brought by the state in addition to or in lieu of the civil and criminal in personam forfeiture procedures set forth in sections 13-4312 and 13-4313 if the prosecutor shows by clear and convincing evidence that there is no known owner of the seized property, diligent efforts have been made to identify the owner of the seized property and no person has asserted an ownership interest in the seized property or that, before or after the conviction, the defendant or alleged criminal:

1. Died.

2. No longer resides in the United States or was deported.

3. Was granted immunity or reduced punishment in exchange for testifying or assisting a law enforcement investigation or prosecution.

4. Fled the jurisdiction of this state.

5. Abandoned the property.

C. On the filing of a civil in rem action by the state in superior court the clerk of the court in which the action is filed or the attorney for the state shall provide the notice of pending forfeiture required by section 13-4307 unless the files of the clerk of the court reflect that the notice has previously been made.

D. An owner of or interest holder in the property may file a claim against the property pursuant to section 13-4307, within sixty days after the notice, for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of the owner's or interest holder's claimed interest in the property. The court shall hold the hearing without a jury.  An owner or interest holder may not be charged a filing fee or any other charge for filing the claim.

#### Section 13-4312. Judicial in personam forfeiture proceedings

A. Any complaint, information or indictment alleging or charging one or more offenses included in section 13-2301, subsection D, paragraph 4 or a violation of section 13-2312, or any other offense giving rise to forfeiture under this title, shall set forth with reasonable particularity property that the state seeks to forfeit pursuant to this section in that action, if any.

B. Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, a temporary restraining order under this section may be entered on application of the state without notice or an opportunity for a hearing if the state demonstrates both that:

1. The seizure is incident to a lawful arrest for a crime or a search lawfully conducted pursuant to a search warrant and the state has probable cause to believe that the property with respect to which the order is sought would, if a conviction occurs, be subject to forfeiture under this title and that the subject of the arrest or search warrant is an owner of the property.

2. Provision of notice will jeopardize the availability of the property for forfeiture.  A temporary restraining order expires within ten days after the date on which it is entered unless the party against whom it is entered consents to an extension for a longer period or unless the state can demonstrate the property is being held as evidence in a criminal case.

C. Notice of the entry of the restraining order and an opportunity for a hearing shall be afforded to persons known to have an interest in the property, whether or not a temporary restraining order is entered without notice. The hearing, however, is limited to the issues of whether both:

1. There is a probability that the state will prevail on the issue of forfeiture and that failure to enter the order will result in the property being destroyed, conveyed, encumbered or further encumbered, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, concealed or otherwise made unavailable for forfeiture.

2. The need to preserve the availability of property through the entry of the requested order outweighs the hardship on any owner, interest holder or defendant against whom the order is to be entered.

D. A hearing requested by any owner or interest holder concerning an order entered under this section shall be held at the earliest possible time and before the expiration of a temporary order.

#### Section 13-4313. Supplemental remedies

A. The court shall order the forfeiture of any other property of a claimant or an in personam civil or criminal defendant up to the value of the claimant's or defendant's property that the court finds is subject to forfeiture if any of the following circumstances apply to the property:

1. It cannot be located.

2. It has been transferred or conveyed to, sold to or deposited with a third party.

3. It has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court.

4. It has been substantially diminished in value by any act or omission of the defendant.

5. It has been commingled with other property which cannot be divided without difficulty.

6. It is subject to any interest that is exempt from forfeiture.

B. In addition to any other remedy provided for by law, if property subject to forfeiture is conveyed, alienated, encumbered, disposed of, received, removed from the jurisdiction of the court, concealed or otherwise rendered unavailable for forfeiture after the filing of a racketeering lien notice or provision of notice of pending forfeiture or after the filing and notice of a civil proceeding or criminal proceeding alleging forfeiture under this chapter, whichever is earlier, the state may institute an action in superior court against the person named in the racketeering lien or notice of pending forfeiture or the defendant in the civil proceeding or criminal proceeding, and the court shall enter final judgment against the person named in the racketeering lien or notice of pending forfeiture or the defendant in the civil proceeding or criminal proceeding in an amount equal to the fair market value of the property, together with reasonable investigative expenses and attorney fees. If a civil proceeding under this chapter is pending, the action shall be filed only in the court where the civil proceeding is pending.

C. This section does not limit the right of the state to obtain any order or injunction, receivership, writ, attachment, garnishment or other remedy authorized under this title or appropriate to protect the interests of the state or available under other applicable law, including title 44, chapter 8, article 1.

#### Section 13-4314. Disposition by court

A. If no claims are timely filed, the attorney for the state shall apply to the court for an order of forfeiture and allocation of forfeited property pursuant to section 13-4315. On the state's written application showing jurisdiction, notice and facts sufficient to demonstrate probable cause for forfeiture, the court shall order the property forfeited to the state.

B. After the court's disposition of all claims timely filed under this chapter, the state has clear title to the forfeited property and the court shall so order. Title to the forfeited property and its proceeds is deemed to have vested in the state on the commission of the act or omission giving rise to the forfeiture under this title.

C. On order of the court forfeiting the subject property, the attorney for the state may transfer good and sufficient title to any subsequent purchaser or transferee, and the title shall be recognized by all courts, by this state and by all departments and agencies of this state and any political subdivision.  The attorney for the state may not transfer title to either:

1. An officer or employee of the agency that seized the property or a person who is related to the officer or employee by blood or marriage.

2. The attorney for the state or any individual working in the same office or any person related to the authority or individual by blood or marriage.

D. On entry of judgment for a claimant or claimants in any proceeding to forfeit property under this chapter such property or interest in property shall be returned or conveyed immediately to the claimant or claimants designated by the court. The person or seizing agency that made the seizure and the attorney for the state are not personally liable to suit or judgment on account of such seizure, suit or prosecution unless the person, seizing agency or attorney for the state intended to cause injury or was grossly negligent.

E. The court may award reasonable attorney fees, expenses and damages for loss of the use of the property to any claimant who substantially prevails by an adjudication on the merits of a claim.  If the court finds that reasonable cause did not exist for the seizure for forfeiture or the filing of the notice of pending forfeiture, complaint, information or indictment and that the seizing agency or attorney for the state intended to cause injury or was grossly negligent, the court shall award the claimant treble costs or damages. The court must apportion the award for treble costs or damages between the agency that made the seizure and the office of the attorney for the state.

#### Section 13-4315. Allocation of forfeited property

A. Any property, including all interests in property, forfeited to the state under this title shall be transferred as requested by the attorney for the state to the seizing agency or to the agency or political subdivision employing the attorney for the state, which may do any of the following:

1. Sell, lease, lend or transfer the property to any local or state government entity or agency or political subdivision, any law enforcement agency or prosecutorial agency or any federal law enforcement agency that operates within this state for official federal, state or political subdivision use within this state, with expenses for keeping and transferring such property to be paid by the recipient. Property may not be allocated for official use if the fair market value of the property substantially exceeds the agency's probable cost of purchasing other property equally suited for the intended official use. Property that is allocated for official use may not be assigned for use by any person who supervised or exercised discretion in its forfeiture unless the use is approved in writing by the head of the agency.

2. Sell forfeited property by public or otherwise commercially reasonable sale with expenses of keeping and selling the property and the amount of all valid interests established by claimants paid out of the proceeds of the sale with the balance paid into the anti-racketeering revolving fund of the state or of the county in which the political subdivision seizing the property or prosecuting the action is located. A sale of forfeited property may not be made to any employee of the seizing agency, any person who participated in the forfeiture, any employee of a contractor selling the property on behalf of the seizing agency or any member of the immediate family of any of these employees or persons.

3. Destroy or use for investigative purposes any illegal or controlled substances or other contraband at any time more than twenty days after seizure, on written approval of the attorney for the state, preserving only such material as may be necessary for evidence.

4. Sell, use or destroy all raw materials, products and equipment of any kind used or intended for use in manufacturing, compounding or processing a controlled substance.

5. Compromise and pay claims against property forfeited pursuant to any provision of this section.

6. Make any other disposition of forfeited property authorized by law for the disposition of property of the state, government entity, agency or political subdivision.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section or any other law to the contrary:

1. If the property forfeited is money, and a law enforcement agency can specifically identify monies as being from its investigative funds or as being exchanged for property from its investigative property, the monies shall be remitted to the investigative fund. If there are additional forfeited monies or monies tendered on satisfaction by an interest holder that cannot be specifically identified, the court shall order the monies returned to each law enforcement agency that makes a showing of costs or expenses that it incurred in connection with the investigation and prosecution of the matter and shall order all excess monies remaining after such returns deposited in the anti-racketeering revolving fund of this state or of the county in which the political subdivision seizing the monies or prosecuting the action is located, established pursuant to section 13-2314.01 or 13-2314.03.

2. If the property declared forfeited is an interest in a vehicle, the court shall order it forfeited to the local, state or other law enforcement agency seizing the vehicle for forfeiture or to the seizing agency.

C. Monies in any anti-racketeering revolving fund established pursuant to this title may be used, in addition to any other lawful use, for:

1. The payment of any expenses necessary to seize, detain, appraise, inventory, protect, maintain, preserve the availability of, advertise or sell property that is subject to forfeiture and that is seized, detained or forfeited pursuant to this title or of any other necessary expenses incident to the seizure, detention, preservation or forfeiture of the property. The payments may include payments for contract services and payments to reimburse any federal, state or local agency for any expenditures made to perform the investigative, storage and maintenance functions associated with the property held by the seizing agency.

2. The payment of awards for information or assistance leading to a civil or criminal proceeding under this title.

3. The payment of compensation from forfeited property to injured persons as provided in section 13-4310, subsection P, paragraph 3.

D. Each attorney for the state shall submit a copy of each forfeiture judgment, including each order of forfeiture, to the Arizona criminal justice commission within sixty days after the forfeiture judgment becomes final or after the conclusion of appellate review, if any.

#### Section 13-4402. Implementation of rights and duties

A. Except as provided in sections 13-4405 and 13-4433 and section 13-4408, subsection B, the rights and duties that are established by this chapter arise on the arrest or formal charging of the person or persons who are alleged to be responsible for a criminal offense against a victim. The rights and duties continue to be enforceable pursuant to this chapter until the final disposition of the charges, including acquittal or dismissal of the charges, all post-conviction release and relief proceedings and the discharge of all criminal proceedings relating to restitution. If a defendant is ordered to pay restitution to a victim, the rights and duties continue to be enforceable by the court until restitution is paid.

B. If a defendant's conviction is reversed and the case is returned to the trial court for further proceedings, the victim has the same rights that were applicable to the criminal proceedings that led to the appeal or other post-conviction relief proceeding.

C. After the final termination of a criminal prosecution by dismissal with prejudice or acquittal, a person who has received notice and the right to be present and heard pursuant to the victims' rights act, article II, 1, Constitution of Arizona, any implementing legislation or court rule is no longer entitled to such rights.

#### Section 13-4402.01. Victims' rights; dismissed counts

A. If a criminal offense against a victim has been charged but the prosecution on the count or counts involving the victim has been or is being dismissed as the result of a plea agreement in which the defendant is pleading to or pled to other charges, the victim of the offenses involved in the dismissed counts, on request, may exercise all the applicable rights of a crime victim throughout the criminal justice process as though the count or counts involving the person had not been dismissed.

B. As to each count that is dismissed, the prosecutor shall notify the probation department if the victim requested the victim's rights pursuant to this chapter.

C. For each victim who is involved in the dismissed counts and who requested the victim's rights, the prosecutor shall forward to the probation department information within the prosecutor's possession that would enable the probation department to carry out its duties as prescribed by this chapter.

 

#### Section 13-4403. Inability to exercise rights; lawful representatives; notice; definition

A. If a victim is physically or emotionally unable to exercise any right but is able to designate a lawful representative who is not a bona fide witness, the designated representative may exercise the same rights that the victim is entitled to exercise.  The victim may revoke this designation at any time and exercise the victim's rights.

B. If a victim is incompetent, deceased or otherwise incapable of designating a representative to act in the victim's place, the court may appoint a lawful representative who is not a witness.  If at any time the victim is no longer incompetent, incapacitated or otherwise incapable of acting, the victim may personally exercise the victim's rights.

C. If the victim is a minor or vulnerable adult the victim's parent, child or other immediate family member may exercise all of the victim's rights on behalf of the victim.  If the criminal offense is alleged against a member of the minor's or vulnerable adult’s immediate family, the victim’s rights may not be exercised by that person but may be exercised by another member of the immediate family unless, after considering the guidelines in subsection D of this section, the court finds that another person would better represent the interests of the minor or vulnerable adult for purposes of this chapter.

D. The court shall consider the following guidelines in appointing a representative for a minor or vulnerable adult victim:

1. Whether there is a relative who would not be so substantially affected or adversely impacted by the conflict occasioned by the allegation of criminal conduct against a member of the immediate family of the minor or vulnerable adult that the relative could not represent the victim.

2. The representative's willingness and ability to do all of the following:

(a) Undertake working with and accompanying the minor or vulnerable adult victim through all proceedings, including criminal, civil and dependency proceedings.

(b) Communicate with the minor or vulnerable adult victim.

(c) Express the concerns of the minor or vulnerable adult victim to those authorized to come in contact with the minor or vulnerable adult as a result of the proceedings.

3. The representative's training, if any, to serve as a minor or vulnerable adult victim’s representative.

4. The likelihood of the representative being called as a witness in the case.

E. The minor or vulnerable adult victim’s representative shall accompany the minor or vulnerable adult through all proceedings, including delinquency, criminal, dependency and civil proceedings, and, before the minor's or vulnerable adult’s courtroom appearance, shall explain to the minor or vulnerable adult the nature of the proceedings and what the minor or vulnerable adult will be asked to do, including telling the minor or vulnerable adult that the minor or vulnerable adult is expected to tell the truth.  The representative shall be available to observe the minor or vulnerable adult in all aspects of the case in order to consult with the court as to any special needs of the minor or vulnerable adult.  Those consultations shall take place before the minor or vulnerable adult testifies.  The court may recognize the minor or vulnerable adult victim’s representative when the representative indicates a need to address the court.  A minor or vulnerable adult victim’s representative shall not discuss the facts and circumstances of the case with the minor or vulnerable adult witness, unless the court orders otherwise upon a showing that it is in the best interests of the minor or vulnerable adult.

F. Any notices that are to be provided to a victim pursuant to this chapter shall be sent only to the victim or the victim's lawful representative.

G. For the purposes of this section, "vulnerable adult" has the same meaning prescribed in section 13-3623.

#### Section 13-4404. Limited rights of a legal entity

4. A lawful representative of the legal entity shall have the right, if present, to be heard at any proceeding relating to the sentencing or restitution of the person convicted of committing the criminal offense against the legal entity.

#### Section 13-4405. Information provided to victim by law enforcement agencies

A. As soon after the detection of a criminal offense as the victim may be contacted without interfering with an investigation or arrest, the law enforcement agency that has responsibility for investigating the criminal offense shall provide electronic forms, pamphlets, information cards or other materials to the victim:

1. That allows the victim to request or waive applicable rights to which the victim is entitled, on request, under this article.

(h) If the victim chooses to exercise the right to be heard through a written statement, how that statement may be submitted to the court.

(i) That the victim or the immediate family member of the victim, if the victim is killed or incapacitated, has the right to receive one copy of the police report, including any supplements to the report, from the investigating law enforcement agency at no charge pursuant to section 39-127.

B. If at the time of contact with a law enforcement agency the victim is physically or emotionally unable to request or waive applicable rights, the law enforcement agency shall designate this in the format that is authorized by subsection A of this section and the entities that may be subsequently affected shall presume that the victim invoked the victim's right to request applicable rights to which the victim is entitled, on request, unless the victim later waives those rights.

C. The law enforcement agency shall submit a copy of the victim's request or waiver of preconviction rights form to the custodial agency and a copy to the prosecutor if a suspect is arrested, at the time the suspect is taken into custody.

C. Subsection B of this section does not apply to:

1. The victim's name except, if the victim is a minor, the victim's name may be redacted from public records pertaining to the crime if the countervailing interests of confidentiality, privacy, the rights of the minor or the best interests of this state outweigh the public interest in disclosure.

2. Any records that are transmitted between law enforcement and prosecution agencies or a court.

3. Any records if the victim or, if the victim is a minor, the victim's representative as designated under section 13-4403 has consented to the release of the information.

4. The general location at which the reported crime occurred.

5. The victim's address, if the victim's address appears in any body-worn camera footage, photographs or other visual or audio depictions and there is evidence that the defendant knows the victim's address because of a relationship set forth in section 13-3601, subsection A.

D. Notwithstanding subsections A and B of this section, a court may order the victim's identifying and locating information to be disclosed in a specific case if it is necessary to protect the defendant's constitutional rights or when the information is not reasonably able to be redacted because of undue burden or expense.  Before the court discloses the information, the victim must be notified and has the right to be heard by the court. If the disclosure is made to the defendant's attorney, the defendant's attorney may not disclose the information to any person other than the attorney's staff and a designated investigator.  The defendant's attorney may not provide the disclosed information to the defendant without specific authorization from the court.

#### Section 13-4436. Effect of failure to comply

A. The failure to comply with a victim's constitutional or statutory right is a ground for the victim to request a reexamination proceeding within ten days of the proceeding at which the victim’s right was denied or with leave of the court for good cause shown. After the victim requests a reexamination proceeding and after the court gives reasonable notice, the court shall afford the victim a reexamination proceeding to consider the issues raised by the denial of the victim's right.  Except as provided in subsection B, the court shall reconsider any decision that arises from a proceeding in which the victim's right was not protected and shall ensure that the victim's rights are thereafter protected.

B. The failure to use reasonable efforts to perform a duty or provide a right is not cause to seek to set aside a conviction after trial.  Failure to afford a right under this chapter shall not provide grounds for a new trial.  A victim who was given notice of a plea or sentencing proceeding may make a motion to reopen a plea or sentence only if the victim was not voluntarily absent from the proceeding and has asserted the right to be heard before or during the proceeding at issue and the right to be heard was denied and, in the case of a plea, the accused has not pled to the highest offense charged.  This subsection does not affect the victim’s right to restitution, which the victim may seek to enforce at any time.

C. Unless the prisoner is discharged from the prisoner's sentence, the failure to use reasonable efforts to provide notice and a right to be present or be heard pursuant to this chapter at a proceeding that involves a post-conviction release is a ground for the victim to seek to set aside the post-conviction release until the victim is afforded the opportunity to be present or be heard.

D. If the victim seeks to have a post-conviction release set aside pursuant to subsection C, the court, board of executive clemency or state department of corrections shall afford the victim a reexamination proceeding after the parties are given notice.

E. A reexamination proceeding conducted pursuant to this section or any other proceeding that is based on the failure to perform a duty or provide a right shall commence not more than thirty days after the appropriate parties have been given notice that the victim is exercising the right to a reexamination proceeding pursuant to this section or to another proceeding based on the failure to perform a duty or provide a right.

 

#### Section 13-4437. Standing to invoke rights; recovery of damages; right to counsel

A. The rights enumerated in the victims' bill of rights, article II, 1, Constitution of Arizona, any implementing legislation or court rules belong to the victim.  The victim has standing to seek an order, to bring a special action or to file a notice of appearance in a trial court or an appellate proceeding, seeking to enforce any right or to challenge an order denying any right guaranteed to victims. A victim may not be charged a filing fee to file a special action or to seek an order pursuant to this subsection. In asserting any right, the victim has the right to be represented by personal counsel at the victim's expense and the proceedings may be initiated by the victim's counsel or the prosecutor.

B. A victim has the right to recover damages from a governmental entity responsible for the intentional, knowing or grossly negligent violation of the victim's rights under the victims' bill of rights, article II, 1, Constitution of Arizona, any implementing legislation or court rules.  Nothing in this section alters or abrogates any provision for immunity provided for under common law or statute.

C. At the request of the victim, the prosecutor may assert any right to which the victim is entitled.

D. On the filing of a notice of appearance, counsel for the victim shall be endorsed on all pleadings and, if present, be included in all bench conferences and in chambers meetings and sessions with the trial court that directly involve a victim's right enumerated in article II, 1, Constitution of Arizona.

E. Notwithstanding any other law and without limiting any rights and powers of the victim, the victim has the right to present evidence or information and to make an argument to the court, personally or through counsel, at any proceeding to determine the amount of restitution pursuant to section 13-804.

#### Section 13-4438. Statement of rights

In order to assure that any victim who comes before the court has been advised of the victim's constitutional rights, the following statement shall be prominently posted in each superior, justice of the peace and municipal court in this state and shall be read out loud by a judge of the superior court at the daily commencement of the regular criminal docket at which accused persons are arraigned, appear for a status conference, make a change of plea or are sentenced:
