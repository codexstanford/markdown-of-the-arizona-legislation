### Article 2 - Issuance of Shares

#### Section 10-620. Subscription for shares

A. A subscription for shares entered into before incorporation is irrevocable by the subscriber for a period of six months from the date of the subscription agreement, unless the subscription agreement provides a longer or shorter period or all of the subscribers agree to revocation.

B. The board of directors may determine the payment terms of subscriptions for shares, unless the subscription agreement specifies them. Any call made by the board of directors for payment on subscriptions shall be uniform as far as practicable as to all shares of the same class or series, unless the subscription agreement specifies otherwise.

C. Shares issued pursuant to subscriptions entered into before incorporation shall be fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the consideration specified in the subscription agreement.

D. If a subscriber defaults in the payment of money or property when due under a subscription agreement, the corporation may collect the amount due in the same manner as any other debt. The subscription agreement may prescribe other penalties for failure to pay installments or calls that may become due, except that no penalty working a rescission or forfeiture of a subscription or of the amounts paid on a subscription may be declared as against any subscriber unless the subscriber fails to cure the default within twenty days after the corporation sends written notice of the default to the subscriber at his last known address. Subject to the foregoing, the board of directors may release, settle or compromise, on such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate, any subscription for shares or any dispute or action arising out of a subscription for shares, unless the subscription agreement provides otherwise.

B. The board of directors may authorize shares to be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation including cash, services performed or other securities of the corporation, except that neither promissory notes nor future services constitute valid consideration.

C. Before the corporation issues shares, the board of directors must determine that the consideration received or to be received for shares to be issued is adequate. That determination by the board of directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

D. When the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of directors authorized the issuance of shares, the shares issued for the consideration are fully paid and nonassessable.

#### Section 10-622. Liability of subscribers and shareholders

A. A purchaser from a corporation of its own shares is not liable to the corporation or its creditors with respect to the shares except to pay the full consideration for which the shares were authorized to be issued pursuant to section 10-621 or specified in the subscription agreement pursuant to section 10-620.

1. The articles of incorporation so authorize.

2. A majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the class or series to be issued approves the issue.

3. There are no outstanding shares of the class or series to be issued.

These rights, options or warrants shall be evidenced in writing, and the board of directors shall determine the terms on which the rights, options or warrants are issued and their form and content. The consideration to be received for any shares on the exercise of these rights, options or warrants is governed by section 10-621.

B. The articles of incorporation may provide that the issuance of rights, options or warrants to directors, officers or employees of the corporation or any affiliate of the directors, officers or employees shall be approved by the shareholders.

C. The rights, options or warrants may include provisions that adjust the terms of the rights, options or warrants if there is an acquisition of shares, reorganization, merger, consolidation, sale of assets or other occurrence.

#### Section 10-625. Form and content of certificates

A. Shares may but need not be represented by certificates. Unless chapters 1 through 17 of this title or another statute expressly provides otherwise, the rights and obligations of shareholders are identical whether or not their shares are represented by certificates.

Alternatively, each certificate may state conspicuously on its front or back that the corporation will furnish this information to the shareholder on request in writing and without charge.

D. Each share certificate:

1. Shall be signed either manually or in facsimile by one or more officers designated in the bylaws or by the board of directors.

2. May bear the corporate seal or its facsimile.

A.

A. The articles of incorporation, the bylaws, an agreement among shareholders or an agreement between shareholders and the corporation may impose restrictions on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares of the corporation. A restriction does not affect shares issued before the restriction was adopted unless the holders of the shares are parties to the restriction agreement or voted in favor of the restriction.

D. A restriction on the transfer or registration of transfer of shares may:

### Article 3 - Subsequent Acquisition of Shares by Shareholders and Corporation

#### Section 10-630. Shareholders' preemptive rights; definition

A. The shareholders of a corporation do not have any preemptive right to acquire the corporation's unissued shares except to the extent the articles of incorporation so provide.

B. A statement included in the articles of incorporation that "the corporation elects to have preemptive rights" or words of similar import means that the following principles apply except to the extent the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise:

1. The shareholders of the corporation have a preemptive right, granted on uniform terms and conditions prescribed by the board of directors, to provide a fair and reasonable opportunity to exercise the right to acquire proportional amounts of the corporation's unissued shares on the decision of the board of directors to issue them.

2. A shareholder may waive his preemptive right. A waiver evidenced by a writing is irrevocable even though it is not supported by consideration.

3. There is no preemptive right with respect to:

(a) Shares issued as compensation to directors, officers, agents or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or its affiliates.

(b) Shares issued to satisfy conversion or option rights created to provide compensation to directors, officers, agents or employees of the corporation, its subsidiaries or its affiliates.

5. Holders of shares of any class with general voting rights but without preferential rights to distributions or assets have no preemptive rights with respect to shares of any class with preferential rights to distributions or assets unless the shares with preferential rights are convertible into or carry a right to subscribe for or acquire shares without preferential rights.

6. Shares that are subject to preemptive rights and that are not acquired by shareholders may be issued to any person for a period of one year after being offered to shareholders at a consideration set by the board of directors that is not lower than the consideration set for the exercise of preemptive rights. An offer at a lower consideration or after the expiration of one year is subject to the shareholders' preemptive rights.

C. For purposes of this section, "shares" includes a security convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares.

#### Section 10-631. Corporation's acquisition of its own shares

A. A corporation may acquire its own shares, and shares so acquired constitute authorized but unissued shares.

The board of directors may adopt a statement that is entitled "statement pursuant to section 10-631", that constitutes an amendment to the articles of incorporation, that is effective as provided in section 10-123 and that is effective without shareholder action. The statement must set forth all of the following:

1. The name of the corporation.

2. The reduction in the number of authorized shares, itemized by class and series.

### Article 4 - Distributions

#### Section 10-640. Distribution to shareholders

A. A board of directors may authorize and the corporation may make distributions to its shareholders subject to restriction by the articles of incorporation and the limitation in subsection C.

B. If the board of directors does not fix the record date for determining shareholders entitled to a distribution, other than one involving any purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, it is the date the board of directors authorizes the distribution.

C. A distribution shall not be made if, after giving it effect, either:

1. The corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business.

2. The corporation's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus, unless the articles of incorporation permit otherwise, the amount that would be needed, if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights on dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution.

D. The board of directors may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection C either on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances, which in the absence of special circumstances shall be generally accepted accounting principles or applicable regulatory accounting principles, or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.

E. Except as provided in subsection G, the effect of a distribution under subsection C is measured:

1. In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the corporation's shares, as of the earlier of either:

(a) The date money or other property is transferred or debt is incurred by the corporation.

(b) The date the shareholder ceases to be a shareholder with respect to the acquired shares.

(a) The date the distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization.

(b) The date the payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization.

F. A corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors except to the extent subordinated by agreement.

G. Indebtedness of a corporation, including indebtedness issued as a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection C if its terms provide that payments of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to shareholders could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is actually made.

F. The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section is not a ground for imposing personal liability on any shareholder for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were a partnership or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.

G. Incorporators or subscribers for shares may act as shareholders with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no shares have been issued when the agreement is made.

H. This section does not apply to, limit or invalidate agreements that are otherwise valid or authorized without regard to this section, including without limitation shareholder agreements between or among some or all of the shareholders or agreements between or among the corporation and one or more shareholders.

D. If a shareholders' vote does not comply with subsection A of this section solely because of a failure of a director to comply with subsection C of this section and if the director establishes that his failure did not determine and was not intended by him to influence the outcome of the vote, the court, with or without further proceedings respecting section 10-861, subsection B, paragraph 3, may take such action respecting the transaction and the director and give such effect, if any, to the shareholders' vote, as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.

E. For purposes of this section, "qualified shares" means any shares entitled to vote with respect to the director's conflicting interest transaction except shares that, to the knowledge, before the vote, of the secretary, or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes, are beneficially owned, or the voting of which is controlled, by a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction or by a related person of the director, or both.

An election pursuant to this section is irrevocable unless the court determines that it is equitable to set aside or modify the election.

E. On determining the fair value of the shares, the court shall enter an order directing the purchase on the terms and conditions as the court deems appropriate, which may include payment of the purchase price in installments, if necessary in the interests of equity, provision for security to assure payment of the purchase price and any additional costs, fees and expenses as may have been awarded and, if the shares are to be purchased by shareholders, the allocation of shares among them. In allocating the petitioner's shares among holders of different classes of shares, the court shall attempt to preserve the existing distribution of voting rights among holders of different classes insofar as practicable and may direct that holders of a specific class or classes shall not participate in the purchase. Interest may be allowed at the rate and from the date determined by the court to be equitable, but if the court finds that the refusal of the petitioning shareholder to accept an offer of payment was arbitrary or otherwise not in good faith, interest shall not be allowed. If the court finds that the petitioning shareholder had probable grounds for relief under section 10-1430, subsection B, paragraph 2 or 4, it may award to the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses of an attorney and of any experts employed by him.

On filing of the articles of dissolution, the corporation shall be dissolved in accordance with sections 10-1405, 10-1406 and 10-1407, and the order entered pursuant to subsection E of this section does not have any force or effect, except that the court may award the petitioning shareholder reasonable fees and expenses in accordance with subsection E of this section and the petitioner may continue to pursue any claims previously asserted on behalf of the corporation.

#### Section 10-2130. Board of directors; term; compensation; quorum

A. A board of directors shall manage the business of a generation and transmission cooperative.

E. Any action which may be taken at a meeting may be taken without a meeting if a writing stating and approving the action taken is signed prior to the action being taken by the number of directors normally required to approve the action at a meeting.

G. Any person who serves as a director or officer or who serves on a board or council in an advisory capacity to the cooperative or board of directors of a cooperative is immune from civil liability and is not subject to a suit directly or by way of contribution for any act or omission that results in damage or injury if that person was acting in good faith and within the scope of that person's official capacity and the damage or injury was not caused by the wilful or grossly negligent conduct of that person. Nothing in this subsection limits or modifies in any manner the duties or liabilities of a director or person who serves in an advisory capacity to the cooperative or the cooperative's members. For the purposes of this subsection, "official capacity" means any decision, act or event undertaken by the cooperative in furtherance of the purposes for which that cooperative is organized or operating.

#### Section 10-2131. Officers of a generation and transmission cooperative

The officers of a generation and transmission cooperative consist of a president, vice-president, secretary and treasurer, who are elected annually by and from the board of directors.

Unless the bylaws provide otherwise, if a person holding any office ceases to be a director, the person ceases to hold the office. The offices of secretary and treasurer may be held by the same person. The board of directors may also elect or appoint such other officers, agents or employees it deems necessary or advisable and shall prescribe their powers and duties. An officer may be removed from office and the officer's successor may be elected in the manner prescribed in the bylaws.

#### Section 10-2132. Bylaws

#### Section 10-2133. Nonprofit operation

A generation and transmission cooperative shall be operated on a nonprofit basis for the mutual benefit of its members and patrons.

Any such mortgages or deeds of trust are exempt from the mortgage recording tax.

B. A generation and transmission cooperative may not sell, lease or otherwise dispose of all or a substantial portion of its property unless the sale, lease or other disposition is authorized by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of those members of the generation and transmission cooperative, acting through their voting delegates, present at a meeting of the members.

#### Section 10-2135. Recording of mortgages; effect

A. Any mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument executed by a generation and transmission cooperative doing business in this state pursuant to this article, which affects real and personal property which is recorded in the office of the county recorder in any county in which the property is located or is to be located, has the same force and effect as if the mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument were also recorded, filed or indexed as provided by statute in the office of the county recorder in the county as a mortgage of personal property. All property of the generation and transmission cooperative described or referred to as being mortgaged or pledged in the mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument becomes subject to the lien immediately upon acquisition of the property by the generation and transmission cooperative whether or not the property was in existence at the time of execution of the mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument. Recording of the mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument constitutes notice and otherwise has the same effect with respect to after-acquired property as it has under the statutes relating to recording with respect to property owned by the generation and transmission cooperative at the time of execution of the mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument and described or referred to as being mortgaged or pledged.

B. The lien on personal property of the mortgage, deed of trust or other instrument, after recording, continues in existence and of record for the period of time specified without refiling or the filing of a renewal certificate, affidavit or other supplemental information required by statute relating to renewal, maintenance or extensions of liens upon personal property.

#### Section 10-2136. Use of roads and streets; notice; protest

A. A generation and transmission cooperative has the use of, and the right is expressly granted to it to use, the public highways, county highways and streets and alleys in any area of this state. The generation and transmission cooperative may construct and operate lines connecting any points within this state and connect at the state boundary with like lines.

B. Within the confines of municipal corporations, the use and occupancy of streets shall be under such rights as are acquired by franchises according to law and subject to control and regulation by municipal authorities, and the use of public highways, except state highways, by generation and transmission cooperatives not within the confines of an incorporated city or town shall be regulated by the board of supervisors of the county by license or franchise. The board of supervisors in granting the license or franchise, or at any time after it is granted, may impose such restrictions and limitations concerning the use of the public roads as deemed best for the public safety or welfare. Every franchise granted under this section must include provisions requiring the grantee to bear all expenses, including damage and compensation for any alteration of the direction, surface, grade or alignment of any county road, made for the purpose of the franchise.

C. The board of supervisors before granting the privilege contemplated by this section shall give public notice of its intention to make the grant by publishing notice in some newspaper of general circulation, published within the county, for at least once a week for three weeks prior to the day set for the consideration of the action. If, on or before the date, more than fifty per cent of the qualified electors of the county petition the board of supervisors to deny the privilege, they shall so act, and any privilege granted contrary to the petition is void.

### Article 3 - Resignation and Termination

#### Section 10-3620. Resignation

C. A director elected by cumulative voting may be removed by the members without cause if the requirements of section 10-3808 are met unless the votes cast against removal, or those members not consenting in writing or by ballot to the removal, would be sufficient to elect that director if voted cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast or, if the action is taken by written consent or ballot, all memberships entitled to vote were voted and the entire number of directors authorized at the time of the director's most recent election were then being elected.

F. The existence or performance of an agreement authorized by this section is not a ground for imposing personal liability on any member for the acts or debts of the corporation even if the agreement or its performance treats the corporation as if it were an unincorporated association or results in failure to observe the corporate formalities otherwise applicable to the matters governed by the agreement.

G. Incorporators may act as members with respect to an agreement authorized by this section if no members have been admitted when the agreement is made.

H. This section does not apply to, limit or invalidate agreements that are otherwise valid or authorized without regard to this section, including without limitation member agreements between or among some or all of the members or agreements between or among the corporation and one or more members. The procedure set forth in this section is not the exclusive method of agreement among members or among members and the corporation with respect to any of the matters described in this section.

3. By the members, but directors who are at the time parties to the proceeding may not vote on the determination.

D. If a member's vote does not comply with subsection A of this section solely because of a failure of a director to comply with subsection C of this section and if the director establishes that his failure did not determine and was not intended by him to influence the outcome of the vote, the court, with or without further proceedings respecting section 10-3861, subsection B, paragraph 3, may take such action, respecting the transaction and the director and give such effect, if any, to the members' vote, as it considers appropriate in the circumstances.

E. For purposes of this section, "qualified membership interests" means any membership interests entitled to vote with respect to the director's conflicting interest transaction except membership interests that, to the knowledge, before the vote, of the secretary or other officer or agent of the corporation authorized to tabulate votes, are beneficially owned, or the voting of which is controlled, by a director who has a conflicting interest respecting the transaction or by a related person of the director, or both.
