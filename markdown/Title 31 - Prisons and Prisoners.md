If a prisoner confined in any facility operated by the state department of corrections displays symptoms of mental disorder to such a degree that transfer to the state hospital or a licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections is necessary to ensure adequate treatment, the psychiatrist of the facility, or if no psychiatrist is available, the physician at the facility, shall examine the prisoner and make a written report of the psychiatrist's or physician's recommendations to the director of the state department of corrections. On receipt of a report that states that the psychiatrist or physician finds that the symptoms described in this subsection exist, the director of the state department of corrections may allow the prisoner to voluntarily transfer to a licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is an adult male, to the state hospital or a licensed behavioral health treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is a female or to the state hospital if the prisoner is a minor. If the patient does not voluntarily transfer, the director shall file a petition with the superior court in the county in which the prisoner is incarcerated for transfer for treatment of the prisoner to the state hospital or a licensed behavioral health treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is a female, to a licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is an adult male or to the state hospital if the prisoner is a minor.

B. At least ten days before the court conducts the hearing on the petition for transfer, the state department of corrections shall provide a copy of the petition and written notice of the hearing to the prisoner and written notice of the prisoner's rights at the hearing.

C. At least five days before the hearing, if the prisoner has not employed counsel, the court shall appoint counsel or an independent advisor to represent the prisoner at the hearing. On application by the prisoner the court shall also determine the necessity for any expert testimony by medical witnesses and authorize any necessary appointment and compensation for these witnesses at the state's expense. Notice shall be given to the state hospital if the prisoner is a female or a minor, and the state hospital shall be provided with an opportunity to participate in the hearing as an interested party, if it so desires.

D. At the hearing, the prisoner or the prisoner's representative may call witnesses to testify and may confront and cross-examine witnesses called by the state department of corrections except on a finding of good cause for not permitting such presentation, confrontation or cross-examination.

E. If the prisoner is determined to be suffering from a mental disorder to such a degree that transfer to the state hospital or a licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections is necessary to ensure adequate treatment, the court shall order and direct that the prisoner be transferred for treatment to the state hospital in the legal custody of the state department of corrections or a licensed behavioral health treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is a female, to a licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is an adult male or to the state hospital if the prisoner is a minor.

The court order must be in writing and state the evidence relied on and the reasons for transferring the prisoner.

F. The superintendent of the state hospital shall provide the state department of corrections with a quarterly report of the condition of a prisoner transferred to the state hospital. The superintendent of the state hospital and the director of the state department of corrections shall also provide the superior court in the county which has jurisdiction over the transfer proceeding with a quarterly report of the condition of the prisoner.

G. If, in the opinion of the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the state department of corrections, the prisoner no longer suffers from a mental disorder such that placement in the state hospital or the licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections is necessary to ensure adequate treatment, the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the state department of corrections shall order the prisoner to a licensed behavioral health treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections or returned to a prison facility to serve the prisoner's unexpired term, and the period the prisoner was confined in the state hospital or the behavioral health or mental health treatment agency shall be considered as though incarcerated in a state department of corrections facility. If the term of imprisonment expires during the time the prisoner is confined in the state hospital or the behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility, the director of the state department of corrections shall issue to the prisoner an absolute discharge at that time, and the prisoner's rights to release from the hospital are as provided in title 36, chapter 5.

H. A court-ordered evaluation may be made in accordance with title 36, chapter 5, article 4 if, within one hundred twenty days of the prisoner's scheduled release from prison or during any time that the prisoner is on release status, the prisoner appears to be, as a result of a mental disorder, a danger to self or to others, or is a prisoner with a grave disability, and is unwilling to undergo a voluntary evaluation. For the purposes of this section, an inpatient mental health treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections is authorized to act as a screening agency. Â If the court orders inpatient evaluation, the order shall take effect on the day of the prisoner's scheduled release, or if the prisoner is on release status, on a date determined by the court, and the state department of corrections shall deliver the prisoner to the evaluation agency. Thereafter, all further evaluation and treatment shall be in accordance with the provisions of title 36, chapter 5, as they pertain to civil patients.

I. The state department of corrections shall pay all costs incurred for the prisoner during the term of the prisoner's sentence.

J. The county in which the court is located shall be reimbursed for expenses of the proceedings incurred by the county in accordance with section 31-227.

For all persons who committed felony offenses before January 1, 1994, the board of executive clemency shall have exclusive power to pass on and recommend reprieves, commutations, paroles and pardons.

B. For all persons who committed felony offenses before January 1, 1994, all applications for reprieves, commutations and pardons made to the governor shall be at once transmitted to the chairperson of the board, and the board shall return the applications with its recommendation to the governor. All applications for reprieves, commutations and pardons made to the governor shall include documentation that the victim or the victim's family was notified pursuant to section 31-411, subsection H.

C. For all persons who committed felony offenses on or after January 1, 1994, in addition to the powers and duties prescribed in subsection A of this section, the board of executive clemency:

1. Is vested with the powers and duties of the board of pardons and paroles as they existed before January 1, 1994 to carry out articles 3, 4.1, 5, 6 and 7 of this chapter.

2. After a hearing for which the victim, county attorney and presiding judge are given notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make recommendations to the governor for commutation of sentence after finding by clear and convincing evidence that the sentence imposed is clearly excessive given the nature of the offense and the record of the offender and that there is a substantial probability that when released the offender will conform the offender's conduct to the requirements of the law.

3. Shall receive petitions from individuals for whom the court has entered a special order allowing the person to petition the board pursuant to section 13-603, subsection L and may make recommendations to the governor.

If the board determines that an offender on community supervision has violated the terms and conditions of community supervision the board may do any of the following:

(a) If the offender has not committed an additional offense, place the offender on electronic monitoring.

(b) Revoke community supervision and return the offender to prison for the remainder of the offender's community supervision.

(c) Impose additional terms and conditions on the offender while keeping the offender on community supervision. If there is reasonable cause to believe that an offender who has been kept on community supervision has violated any term or condition of community supervision, any member of the board may petition the board to revoke community supervision. After a petition to revoke has been submitted, the chairperson may issue a summons directing the offender to appear on a specified date for a revocation hearing or may issue a warrant for the offender's arrest. This subsection does not limit the state department of corrections' authority with respect to submitting revocation petitions or issuing revocation warrants.

E. The executive director shall perform all administrative, operational and financial functions for the board.

F. The executive director may employ case analysts as deemed necessary within the limits of legislative appropriation and subject to title 41, chapter 4, article 4. The analysts shall aid the board in making investigations, in securing information and in performing necessary administrative functions to assist the board in passing on applications for parole and commutation.

G. The executive director may employ hearing officers as deemed necessary within the limits of legislative appropriation and subject to title 41, chapter 4, article 4. The hearing officers shall conduct probable cause hearings on parole, work furlough, community supervision and home arrest revocations or rescissions.

C. Notwithstanding subsection A or B of this section, the board, at the time of denial, may lengthen the five year period of time prescribed in subsection A or B of this section to a period of up to ten years, except that if the offense for which commutation was denied involved a violation of an offense listed in subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, the board may lengthen the period of time to a period of time that is greater than ten years and that is specified by the board by one of the following votes:

1. A majority affirmative vote if four or more members consider the action.

2. A unanimous affirmative vote if three members consider the action.

D. The board may waive the provisions of subsections A, B and C of this section if any of the following applies:

1. The person is in imminent danger of death due to a medical condition, as determined by the board.

C. If the hearing is heard by a hearing officer, the hearing officer shall make a recommendation on application for parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment to the board within thirty days after the hearing date. Within thirty days after the date of the hearing officer's recommendations, the board shall review these recommendations and either approve, with or without conditions, or reject the prisoner's application for parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment.Â  A prisoner who is eligible for parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment shall not be denied parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment without an opportunity to be heard before the board unless another form of release has been granted.

D. If parole is granted, the prisoner shall remain on parole unless the board revokes the parole or grants an absolute discharge from parole or until the prisoner reaches the individual earned release credit date pursuant to section 41-1604.10. If the prisoner violates a condition of parole but has not committed an additional offense, the board may place the prisoner on electronic monitoring. If the prisoner is still on parole on reaching the individual earned release credit date pursuant to section 41-1604.10, the prisoner shall be terminated from parole but shall be subject to revocation under section 41-1604.10. When the prisoner reaches the individual earned release credit date the prisoner's parole shall be terminated and the prisoner shall no longer be under the authority of the board.

E. During the period of time that the prisoner remains on supervised parole under subsection D of this section, the board shall require as a condition of parole that the prisoner pay a monthly supervision fee of at least $65 unless, after determining the inability of the prisoner to pay the fee, the board requires payment of a lesser amount. The supervising parole officer shall monitor the collection of the fee. The board may also impose any conditions of parole it deems appropriate in order to ensure that the best interests of the prisoner and the citizens of this state are served. These conditions may include:

1. Participating in a rehabilitation program or counseling.

2. Performing community restitution work.

F. Seventy percent of the monies collected pursuant to subsection E of this section shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the victim compensation and assistance fund established by section 41-2407 and thirty percent shall be deposited in the community corrections enhancement fund established by section 31-418.

G. When parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment is denied, the board, within ten days, shall prepare and deliver to the director of the state department of corrections a written statement specifying the individualized reasons for the denial of parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment unless another form of release has been granted. The prisoner may view the written statement prepared by the board. Every prisoner, having served not less than one year may be temporarily released according to the rules of the department one hundred eighty days before the expiration of the sentence or the earned release credit date, whichever first occurs, if the director finds that the release is in the best interest of the state. The releasee shall remain under the control of the state department of corrections until expiration of the term specified in the sentence. If the releasee violates any condition of release, the releasee may be returned to custody without further process.

H. When a commutation, absolute discharge from imprisonment or parole is to be considered, the board, on request and before holding a hearing on the commutation, absolute discharge from imprisonment or parole, shall notify the attorney general, the presiding judge of the superior court, the county attorney in the county in which the prisoner requesting a commutation, absolute discharge from imprisonment or parole was sentenced, and the victim of the offense for which the prisoner is incarcerated. The notice to the victim shall be mailed to the last known address.

The prisoner's costs shall not exceed the department's cost for the program.Â  The monies collected pursuant to this subsection by the department may only be used to offset the costs of the drug testing program.

#### Section 31-411.01. Parole or community supervision for persons previously convicted of possession or use of marijuana, a dangerous drug or a narcotic drug; treatment; prevention; education; termination of parole or community supervision

A. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, every prisoner who is eligible for parole or community supervision pursuant to section 41-1604.16 shall be released on parole or community supervision if in its sole discretion the board of executive clemency determines that there is a substantial probability that the prisoner will remain at liberty without violating the law and the release is in the best interests of the people of this state. If a prisoner is denied release on parole or community supervision, the prisoner is not entitled to a rehearing under this section.

B. If a prisoner is released on parole or community supervision pursuant to this section, the board of executive clemency shall order that as a condition of parole or community supervision the person:

1. Be required to participate in an appropriate drug treatment or education program that is administered by a qualified agency, organization or individual approved by the department of health services and that provides the treatment or education to persons who abuse controlled substances. Each person who is enrolled in a drug treatment or education program shall pay for the costs of participation in the program to the extent of the person's financial ability.

C. A prisoner who is released on parole or community supervision pursuant to this section shall remain on parole or community supervision until the prisoner reaches the earned release credit date pursuant to section 41-1604.10 or the community supervision expiration date pursuant to section 41-1604.07. A prisoner who is on earned release credit release pursuant to section 41-1604.10 is not under the control of the state department of corrections and the department is not required to provide parole services or to otherwise supervise any prisoner released except that the department may revoke the release of the prisoner until the final expiration of the prisoner's sentence if the department believes that the released prisoner has engaged in criminal conduct during the term of the prisoner's release.

D. The board of executive clemency may revoke the prisoner's release if the prisoner violates the conditions of supervision that are imposed by the board or the state department of corrections.

A. If a prisoner is certified as eligible for parole pursuant to section 41-1604.09 the board of executive clemency shall authorize the release of the applicant on parole if the applicant has reached the applicant's earliest parole eligibility date pursuant to section 41-1604.09, subsection D and it appears to the board, in its sole discretion, that there is a substantial probability that the applicant will remain at liberty without violating the law and that the release is in the best interests of the state. The applicant shall thereupon be allowed to go on parole in the legal custody and under the control of the state department of corrections, until the board revokes the parole or grants an absolute discharge from parole or until the prisoner reaches the prisoner's individual earned release credit date pursuant to section 41-1604.10. When the prisoner reaches the prisoner's individual earned release credit date the prisoner's parole shall be terminated and the prisoner shall no longer be under the authority of the board but shall be subject to revocation under section 41-1604.10.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the director of the state department of corrections may certify as eligible for parole any prisoner, regardless of the classification of the prisoner, who has reached the prisoner's parole eligibility date pursuant to section 41-1604.09, subsection D, unless an increased term has been imposed pursuant to section 41-1604.09, subsection F, for the sole purpose of parole to the custody of any other jurisdiction to serve a term of imprisonment imposed by the other jurisdiction or to stand trial on criminal charges in the other jurisdiction or for the sole purpose of parole to the custody of the state department of corrections to serve any consecutive term imposed on the prisoner.Â  On review of an application for parole pursuant to this subsection the board may authorize parole if, in its discretion, parole appears to be in the best interests of the state.

C. A prisoner who is otherwise eligible for parole, who is not on home arrest or work furlough and who is currently serving a sentence for a conviction of a serious offense or conspiracy to commit or attempt to commit a serious offense shall not be granted parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment except by one of the following votes:

1. A majority affirmative vote if four or more members consider the action.

E. Payment of restitution by the prisoner in accordance with subsection D of this section shall be made through the clerk of the superior court in the county in which the prisoner was sentenced for the offense for which the prisoner has been imprisoned in the same manner as restitution is paid as a condition of probation. The clerk of the superior court, on request, shall make the prisoner's restitution payment history available to the board, victim, victim's attorney and department without cost.

F. The board shall not disclose the address of the victim or the victim's immediate family to any party without the written consent of the victim or the victim's family.

G. For the purposes of this section, "serious offense" includes any of the following:

#### Section 31-414. Absolute discharge of parolee; effect; notice to victim

A. If, upon application by the state department of corrections on behalf of a prisoner on parole, it appears to the board of executive clemency that there is reasonable probability that the prisoner on parole will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and that his absolute discharge from parole is compatible with the welfare of society and is in the best interest of the state, then the board may authorize the absolute discharge of the prisoner from parole. On notification of the board's decision, the director of the state department of corrections shall issue to the prisoner an absolute discharge from parole which shall be effective to discharge the parolee from the sentence imposed.

B. At least fifteen days before holding a hearing on the absolute discharge from parole of a parolee, the board on request shall notify the victim of the offense for which the parolee was incarcerated and inform the victim of his right to be present and to submit a written report to the board expressing his opinion concerning the absolute discharge of the parolee.

B. It is the purpose of this compact and the interstate commission created under this compact, through means of joint and cooperative action among the compacting states, to do all of the following:

1. Provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community.

2. Provide for the effective tracking, supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states.

3. Equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.

C. In addition, this compact will do all of the following:

1. Create an interstate commission that will establish uniform procedures to manage the movement between states of adults placed under community supervision and released to the community under the jurisdiction of courts, paroling authorities, corrections or other criminal justice agencies that will promulgate rules to achieve the purpose of this compact.

2. Ensure an opportunity for input and timely notice to victims and to jurisdictions where defined offenders are authorized to travel or to relocate across state lines.

3. Establish a system of uniform data collection, access to information on active cases by authorized criminal justice officials and regular reporting of compact activities to heads of state councils, state executive, judicial and legislative branches and criminal justice administrators.

4. Monitor compliance with rules governing interstate movement of offenders and initiate interventions to address and correct noncompliance.

5. Coordinate training and education regarding regulations of interstate movement of offenders for officials involved in such activity.

D. The compacting states recognize that there is no right of any offender to live in another state and that duly accredited officers of a sending state may at all times enter a receiving state and apprehend and retake any offender under supervision subject to the provisions of this compact and bylaws and rules promulgated under this compact.

E. Compacting states recognize no offender may live in another state when acceptance criteria that has been established or adopted by the compacting state has not been met.Â  It is the policy of the compacting states that the activities conducted by the interstate commission created in this compact are the formation of public policies and are therefore public business.

#### Section 31-467.02. Hearing officer

Any hearing pursuant to this article may be before the administrator of the interstate compact for the supervision of adult offenders, a deputy of the administrator or any other person authorized pursuant to the laws of this state to hear cases of alleged parole or probation violation, except that a hearing officer may not be the person making the allegation of violation.

ARTICLE VIII

Withdrawal and Termination

Any court or other agency or officer of this state having power to commit or transfer an inmate, as defined in article II(d) of the western interstate corrections compact, to any institution within or without this state if this state has entered into a contract or contracts for the confinement of inmates in such institution pursuant to article III of the western interstate corrections compact, but no inmate sentenced under Arizona law may be transferred from an institution within this state to an institution without this state, unless he has executed, in the presence of the warden or other head of the institution in this state in which he is confined, a written consent to the transfer. An inmate may not revoke such consent.

No such contract may authorize the confinement of an inmate, who is in the custody of the director of corrections, in an institution of a state other than a state specifically named in article VII of the western interstate corrections compact.

### Article 6 - Agreement on Detainers

#### Section 31-481. Agreement; authorization; contents

The agreement on detainers is entered into by this state with all other jurisdictions legally joining such agreement in the form substantially as follows:

The Agreement on Detainers

The contracting states solemnly agree that:

Article I

The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

Article II

As used in this agreement:

(a) "State" shall mean a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

(b) "Sending state" shall mean a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article III hereof or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV hereof.

(c) "Receiving state" shall mean the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to Article III or Article IV hereof.

Article III

(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint: provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.

(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.

(c) The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.

(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

(e) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.

(f) Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request.

Article IV

(a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with Article V(a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated: provided that the court having jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request: and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.

(b) Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.

(c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by this Article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.

(d) Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.

(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V(e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

Article V

(a) In response to a request made under Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.

(b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:

(1) Proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given.

(2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.

(c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.

(d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.

(e) At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.

(f) During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, the time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.

(g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.

(h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.

Article VI

(a) In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in Articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of said time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.

(b) No provision of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement, shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be mentally ill.

Article VII

Each state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, within and without the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.

Article VIII

This agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when such state has enacted the same into law. A state party to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by inmates or by state officers at the time such withdrawal takes effect, nor shall it affect their rights in respect thereof.

Article IX

This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party hereto, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

#### Section 31-482. Matters pertaining to agreement

A. Every person who has been imprisoned in a prison or institution in this state and who escapes or attempts to escape while in the custody of an officer of this or another state in another state pursuant to the agreement on detainers is deemed to have violated section 13-2503 or 13-2504 and is punishable as provided therein.

B. It shall be lawful and mandatory upon the warden or other official in charge of a penal or correctional institution in this state to give over the person of any inmate thereof whenever so required by the operation of the agreement on detainer. Such official shall inform such inmate of his rights provided in paragraph (a) of article IV of the agreement on detainers.

C. The administrator, in accordance with the interstate probation and parole compacts, shall administer the agreement as prescribed by section 31-481.

D. When, pursuant to the agreement on detainers, a person in actual confinement under sentence of another jurisdiction is brought before an Arizona court and sentenced by the judge to serve an Arizona sentence concurrently with the sentence of the other jurisdiction, the board of executive clemency and members thereof may meet in such other jurisdiction, or enter into cooperative arrangements with corresponding agencies in the other jurisdiction, as necessary to carry out the term-fixing and parole functions.

(f) Any hearing or hearings to which an inmate confined pursuant to this compact may be entitled by the laws of the sending state may be had before the appropriate authorities of the sending state, or of the receiving state if authorized by the sending state. The receiving state shall provide adequate facilities for such hearings as may be conducted by the appropriate officials of a sending state. In the event such hearing or hearings are had before officials of the receiving state, the governing law shall be that of the sending state and a record of the hearing or hearings as prescribed by the sending state shall be made. Said record together with any recommendations of the hearing officials shall be transmitted forthwith to the official or officials before whom the hearing would have been had if it had taken place in the sending state. In any and all proceedings had pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the officials of the receiving state shall act solely as agents of the sending state and no final determination shall be made in any matter except by the appropriate officials of the sending state.

(g) Any inmate confined pursuant to this compact shall be released within the territory of the sending state unless the inmate, and the sending and receiving states, shall agree upon release in some other place. The sending state shall bear the cost of such return to its territory.

(h) Any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact shall have any and all rights to participate in and derive any benefits or incur or be relieved of any obligations or have such obligations modified or his status changed on account of any action or proceeding in which he could have participated if confined in any appropriate institution of the sending state located within such state.

(i) The parent, guardian, trustee, or other person or persons entitled under the laws of the sending state to act for, advise, or otherwise function with respect to any inmate shall not be deprived of or restricted in his exercise of any power in respect of any inmate confined pursuant to the terms of this compact.

Article V

Acts Not Reviewable in Receiving State; Extradition

(a) Any decision of the sending state in respect of any matter over which it retains jurisdiction pursuant to this compact shall be conclusive upon and not reviewable within the receiving state, but if at the time the sending state seeks to remove an inmate from an institution in the receiving state there is pending against the inmate within such state any criminal charge or if the inmate is formally accused of having committed within such state a criminal offense, the inmate shall not be returned without the consent of the receiving state until discharged from prosecution or other form of proceeding, imprisonment or detention for such offense. The duly accredited officers of the sending state shall be permitted to transport inmates pursuant to this compact through any and all states party to this compact without interference.

(b) An inmate who escapes from an institution in which he is confined pursuant to this compact shall be deemed a fugitive from the sending state and from the state in which the institution is situated. In the case of an escape to a jurisdiction other than the sending or receiving state, the responsibility for institution of extradition or rendition proceedings shall be that of the sending state, but nothing contained herein shall be construed to prevent or affect the activities of officers and agencies of any jurisdiction directed toward the apprehension and return of an escapee.

Article VI

Federal Aid

Any state party to this compact may accept federal aid for use in connection with any institution or program, the use of which is or may be affected by this compact or any contract pursuant hereto and any inmate in a receiving state pursuant to this compact may participate in any such federally aided program or activity for which the sending and receiving states have made contractual provision, provided that if such program or activity is not part of the customary correctional regimen, the express consent of the appropriate official of the sending state shall be required therefor.

Article VII

Entry Into Force

This compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding upon the states so acting when it has been enacted into law by any two states. Thereafter, this compact shall enter into force and become effective and binding as to any other of said states upon similar action by such state.

Article VIII

Withdrawal and Termination

This compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon a party state until it shall have enacted a statute repealing the same and providing for the sending of formal written notice of withdrawal from the compact to the appropriate officials of all other party states. An actual withdrawal shall not take effect until one year after the notices provided in said statute have been sent. Such withdrawal shall not relieve the withdrawing state from its obligations assumed hereunder prior to the effective date of withdrawal. Before the effective date of withdrawal, a withdrawing state shall remove to its territory, at its own expense, such inmates as it may have confined pursuant to the provisions of this compact.

Article IX

Other Arrangements Unaffected

Nothing contained in this compact shall be construed to abrogate or impair any agreement or other arrangement which a party state may have with a nonparty state for the confinement, rehabilitation or treatment of inmates nor to repeal any other laws of a party state authorizing the making of cooperative institutional arrangements.

Article X

Construction and Severability

The provisions of this compact shall be liberally construed and shall be severable. If any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby.
