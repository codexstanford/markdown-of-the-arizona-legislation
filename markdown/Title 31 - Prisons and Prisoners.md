On receipt of a report that states that the psychiatrist or physician finds that the symptoms described in this subsection exist, the director of the state department of corrections may allow the prisoner to voluntarily transfer to a licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is an adult male, to the state hospital or a licensed behavioral health treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is a female or to the state hospital if the prisoner is a minor. If the patient does not voluntarily transfer, the director shall file a petition with the superior court in the county in which the prisoner is incarcerated for transfer for treatment of the prisoner to the state hospital or a licensed behavioral health treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is a female, to a licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections if the prisoner is an adult male or to the state hospital if the prisoner is a minor.

The superintendent of the state hospital and the director of the state department of corrections shall also provide the superior court in the county which has jurisdiction over the transfer proceeding with a quarterly report of the condition of the prisoner.

G. If, in the opinion of the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the state department of corrections, the prisoner no longer suffers from a mental disorder such that placement in the state hospital or the licensed behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections is necessary to ensure adequate treatment, the superintendent of the state hospital or the director of the state department of corrections shall order the prisoner to a licensed behavioral health treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections or returned to a prison facility to serve the prisoner's unexpired term, and the period the prisoner was confined in the state hospital or the behavioral health or mental health treatment agency shall be considered as though incarcerated in a state department of corrections facility. If the term of imprisonment expires during the time the prisoner is confined in the state hospital or the behavioral health or mental health inpatient treatment facility, the director of the state department of corrections shall issue to the prisoner an absolute discharge at that time, and the prisoner's rights to release from the hospital are as provided in title 36, chapter 5.

H. A court-ordered evaluation may be made in accordance with title 36, chapter 5, article 4 if, within one hundred twenty days of the prisoner's scheduled release from prison or during any time that the prisoner is on release status, the prisoner appears to be, as a result of a mental disorder, a danger to self or to others, or is a prisoner with a grave disability, and is unwilling to undergo a voluntary evaluation. For the purposes of this section, an inpatient mental health treatment facility operated by the state department of corrections is authorized to act as a screening agency.  If the court orders inpatient evaluation, the order shall take effect on the day of the prisoner's scheduled release, or if the prisoner is on release status, on a date determined by the court, and the state department of corrections shall deliver the prisoner to the evaluation agency.

For all persons who committed felony offenses before January 1, 1994, the board of executive clemency shall have exclusive power to pass on and recommend reprieves, commutations, paroles and pardons. A reprieve, commutation or pardon may not be granted by the governor unless it has first been recommended by the board.

B. For all persons who committed felony offenses before January 1, 1994, all applications for reprieves, commutations and pardons made to the governor shall be at once transmitted to the chairperson of the board, and the board shall return the applications with its recommendation to the governor. All applications for reprieves, commutations and pardons made to the governor shall include documentation that the victim or the victim's family was notified pursuant to section 31-411, subsection H.

C. For all persons who committed felony offenses on or after January 1, 1994, in addition to the powers and duties prescribed in subsection A of this section, the board of executive clemency:

1. Is vested with the powers and duties of the board of pardons and paroles as they existed before January 1, 1994 to carry out articles 3, 4.1, 5, 6 and 7 of this chapter.

2. After a hearing for which the victim, county attorney and presiding judge are given notice and an opportunity to be heard, may make recommendations to the governor for commutation of sentence after finding by clear and convincing evidence that the sentence imposed is clearly excessive given the nature of the offense and the record of the offender and that there is a substantial probability that when released the offender will conform the offender's conduct to the requirements of the law.

3. Shall receive petitions from individuals for whom the court has entered a special order allowing the person to petition the board pursuant to section 13-603, subsection L and may make recommendations to the governor.

4. Shall receive petitions from individuals, organizations or the department for review and commutation of sentences and pardoning of offenders in extraordinary cases and may make recommendations to the governor.

5. Shall receive petitions from the state department of corrections alleging that an offender has violated the offender's terms and conditions of community supervision and has lapsed or is probably about to lapse into criminal ways or company. If the board determines that an offender on community supervision has violated the terms and conditions of community supervision the board may do any of the following:

(a) If the offender has not committed an additional offense, place the offender on electronic monitoring.

(b) Revoke community supervision and return the offender to prison for the remainder of the offender's community supervision.

(c) Impose additional terms and conditions on the offender while keeping the offender on community supervision. If there is reasonable cause to believe that an offender who has been kept on community supervision has violated any term or condition of community supervision, any member of the board may petition the board to revoke community supervision. After a petition to revoke has been submitted, the chairperson may issue a summons directing the offender to appear on a specified date for a revocation hearing or may issue a warrant for the offender's arrest. This subsection does not limit the state department of corrections' authority with respect to submitting revocation petitions or issuing revocation warrants.

D. Any recommendation for commutation that is made unanimously by the members present and voting and that is not acted on by the governor within ninety days after the board submits its recommendation to the governor automatically becomes effective.

E. The executive director shall perform all administrative, operational and financial functions for the board.

F. The executive director may employ case analysts as deemed necessary within the limits of legislative appropriation and subject to title 41, chapter 4, article 4. The analysts shall aid the board in making investigations, in securing information and in performing necessary administrative functions to assist the board in passing on applications for parole and commutation.

G. The executive director may employ hearing officers as deemed necessary within the limits of legislative appropriation and subject to title 41, chapter 4, article 4. The hearing officers shall conduct probable cause hearings on parole, work furlough, community supervision and home arrest revocations or rescissions.

C. Notwithstanding subsection A or B of this section, the board, at the time of denial, may lengthen the five year period of time prescribed in subsection A or B of this section to a period of up to ten years, except that if the offense for which commutation was denied involved a violation of an offense listed in subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section, the board may lengthen the period of time to a period of time that is greater than ten years and that is specified by the board by one of the following votes:

1. A majority affirmative vote if four or more members consider the action.

2. A unanimous affirmative vote if three members consider the action.

D. The board may waive the provisions of subsections A, B and C of this section if any of the following applies:

1. The person is in imminent danger of death due to a medical condition, as determined by the board.

2. The person is the subject of a warrant of execution.

A. Any prisoner who has been certified as eligible for parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment pursuant to section 31-412, subsection B or section 41-1604.09 shall be given an opportunity to apply for release on parole or for an absolute discharge from imprisonment. The board of executive clemency shall not entertain any other form of application or petition for the release on parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment of any prisoner.

B. A prisoner who is eligible for parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment shall be given an opportunity to be heard either before a hearing officer designated by the board or the board itself, at the discretion of the board.

C. If the hearing is heard by a hearing officer, the hearing officer shall make a recommendation on application for parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment to the board within thirty days after the hearing date. Within thirty days after the date of the hearing officer's recommendations, the board shall review these recommendations and either approve, with or without conditions, or reject the prisoner's application for parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment.  A prisoner who is eligible for parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment shall not be denied parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment without an opportunity to be heard before the board unless another form of release has been granted.

D. If parole is granted, the prisoner shall remain on parole unless the board revokes the parole or grants an absolute discharge from parole or until the prisoner reaches the individual earned release credit date pursuant to section 41-1604.10. If the prisoner violates a condition of parole but has not committed an additional offense, the board may place the prisoner on electronic monitoring. If the prisoner is still on parole on reaching the individual earned release credit date pursuant to section 41-1604.10, the prisoner shall be terminated from parole but shall be subject to revocation under section 41-1604.10. When the prisoner reaches the individual earned release credit date the prisoner's parole shall be terminated and the prisoner shall no longer be under the authority of the board.

E. During the period of time that the prisoner remains on supervised parole under subsection D of this section, the board shall require as a condition of parole that the prisoner pay a monthly supervision fee of at least $65 unless, after determining the inability of the prisoner to pay the fee, the board requires payment of a lesser amount. The supervising parole officer shall monitor the collection of the fee. The board may also impose any conditions of parole it deems appropriate in order to ensure that the best interests of the prisoner and the citizens of this state are served. These conditions may include:

1. Participating in a rehabilitation program or counseling.

2. Performing community restitution work.

F. Seventy percent of the monies collected pursuant to subsection E of this section shall be deposited, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, in the victim compensation and assistance fund established by section 41-2407 and thirty percent shall be deposited in the community corrections enhancement fund established by section 31-418.

G. When parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment is denied, the board, within ten days, shall prepare and deliver to the director of the state department of corrections a written statement specifying the individualized reasons for the denial of parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment unless another form of release has been granted. The prisoner may view the written statement prepared by the board. Every prisoner, having served not less than one year may be temporarily released according to the rules of the department one hundred eighty days before the expiration of the sentence or the earned release credit date, whichever first occurs, if the director finds that the release is in the best interest of the state. The releasee shall remain under the control of the state department of corrections until expiration of the term specified in the sentence. If the releasee violates any condition of release, the releasee may be returned to custody without further process.

H. When a commutation, absolute discharge from imprisonment or parole is to be considered, the board, on request and before holding a hearing on the commutation, absolute discharge from imprisonment or parole, shall notify the attorney general, the presiding judge of the superior court, the county attorney in the county in which the prisoner requesting a commutation, absolute discharge from imprisonment or parole was sentenced, and the victim of the offense for which the prisoner is incarcerated. The notice to the victim shall be mailed to the last known address. The notice shall state the name of the prisoner requesting the commutation, absolute discharge from imprisonment or parole and shall set the month of hearing on the application.

J. In addition to any other fees, the board may require as a condition of parole that the prisoner pay the reasonable costs associated with the prisoner's participation in a drug testing program. The prisoner's costs shall not exceed the department's cost for the program.  The monies collected pursuant to this subsection by the department may only be used to offset the costs of the drug testing program.

#### Section 31-411.01. Parole or community supervision for persons previously convicted of possession or use of marijuana, a dangerous drug or a narcotic drug; treatment; prevention; education; termination of parole or community supervision

A. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, every prisoner who is eligible for parole or community supervision pursuant to section 41-1604.16 shall be released on parole or community supervision if in its sole discretion the board of executive clemency determines that there is a substantial probability that the prisoner will remain at liberty without violating the law and the release is in the best interests of the people of this state. If a prisoner is denied release on parole or community supervision, the prisoner is not entitled to a rehearing under this section.

B. If a prisoner is released on parole or community supervision pursuant to this section, the board of executive clemency shall order that as a condition of parole or community supervision the person:

1. Be required to participate in an appropriate drug treatment or education program that is administered by a qualified agency, organization or individual approved by the department of health services and that provides the treatment or education to persons who abuse controlled substances. Each person who is enrolled in a drug treatment or education program shall pay for the costs of participation in the program to the extent of the person's financial ability.

2. On the request of the victim, be prohibited from contacting the victim.

C. A prisoner who is released on parole or community supervision pursuant to this section shall remain on parole or community supervision until the prisoner reaches the earned release credit date pursuant to section 41-1604.10 or the community supervision expiration date pursuant to section 41-1604.07. A prisoner who is on earned release credit release pursuant to section 41-1604.10 is not under the control of the state department of corrections and the department is not required to provide parole services or to otherwise supervise any prisoner released except that the department may revoke the release of the prisoner until the final expiration of the prisoner's sentence if the department believes that the released prisoner has engaged in criminal conduct during the term of the prisoner's release.

D. The board of executive clemency may revoke the prisoner's release if the prisoner violates the conditions of supervision that are imposed by the board or the state department of corrections.

#### Section 31-412. Criteria for release on parole; release; custody of parolee; definition

A. If a prisoner is certified as eligible for parole pursuant to section 41-1604.09 the board of executive clemency shall authorize the release of the applicant on parole if the applicant has reached the applicant's earliest parole eligibility date pursuant to section 41-1604.09, subsection D and it appears to the board, in its sole discretion, that there is a substantial probability that the applicant will remain at liberty without violating the law and that the release is in the best interests of the state. The applicant shall thereupon be allowed to go on parole in the legal custody and under the control of the state department of corrections, until the board revokes the parole or grants an absolute discharge from parole or until the prisoner reaches the prisoner's individual earned release credit date pursuant to section 41-1604.10. When the prisoner reaches the prisoner's individual earned release credit date the prisoner's parole shall be terminated and the prisoner shall no longer be under the authority of the board but shall be subject to revocation under section 41-1604.10.

B. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, the director of the state department of corrections may certify as eligible for parole any prisoner, regardless of the classification of the prisoner, who has reached the prisoner's parole eligibility date pursuant to section 41-1604.09, subsection D, unless an increased term has been imposed pursuant to section 41-1604.09, subsection F, for the sole purpose of parole to the custody of any other jurisdiction to serve a term of imprisonment imposed by the other jurisdiction or to stand trial on criminal charges in the other jurisdiction or for the sole purpose of parole to the custody of the state department of corrections to serve any consecutive term imposed on the prisoner.  On review of an application for parole pursuant to this subsection the board may authorize parole if, in its discretion, parole appears to be in the best interests of the state.

C. A prisoner who is otherwise eligible for parole, who is not on home arrest or work furlough and who is currently serving a sentence for a conviction of a serious offense or conspiracy to commit or attempt to commit a serious offense shall not be granted parole or absolute discharge from imprisonment except by one of the following votes:

1. A majority affirmative vote if four or more members consider the action.

E. Payment of restitution by the prisoner in accordance with subsection D of this section shall be made through the clerk of the superior court in the county in which the prisoner was sentenced for the offense for which the prisoner has been imprisoned in the same manner as restitution is paid as a condition of probation. The clerk of the superior court, on request, shall make the prisoner's restitution payment history available to the board, victim, victim's attorney and department without cost.

F. The board shall not disclose the address of the victim or the victim's immediate family to any party without the written consent of the victim or the victim's family.

G. For the purposes of this section, "serious offense" includes any of the following:

#### Section 31-413. Duty of department of corrections to assist in securing employment for parolees and prisoners

The department of corrections shall assist in securing employment for prisoners paroled, on work furlough, eligible for any release from confinement or discharged.

#### Section 31-414. Absolute discharge of parolee; effect; notice to victim

A. If, upon application by the state department of corrections on behalf of a prisoner on parole, it appears to the board of executive clemency that there is reasonable probability that the prisoner on parole will live and remain at liberty without violating the law, and that his absolute discharge from parole is compatible with the welfare of society and is in the best interest of the state, then the board may authorize the absolute discharge of the prisoner from parole. On notification of the board's decision, the director of the state department of corrections shall issue to the prisoner an absolute discharge from parole which shall be effective to discharge the parolee from the sentence imposed.

B. At least fifteen days before holding a hearing on the absolute discharge from parole of a parolee, the board on request shall notify the victim of the offense for which the parolee was incarcerated and inform the victim of his right to be present and to submit a written report to the board expressing his opinion concerning the absolute discharge of the parolee. The notice shall state the name of the parolee, the offense for which the parolee was sentenced, the length of the sentence and the date of admission to the custody of the state department of corrections.

#### Section 31-415. Violation of parole or community supervision; warrant for retaking parolee or offender on community supervision

If the parole clerk of the department of corrections or the director of the department of corrections, or the board of executive clemency or any member thereof, has reasonable cause to believe that a paroled prisoner or an offender on community supervision has violated his parole or community supervision and has lapsed or is probably about to lapse into criminal ways or company, then any of such persons may issue a warrant for retaking the prisoner or offender at any time prior to expiration of the maximum sentence or term of community supervision, which time shall be specified in the warrant.

If the paroled prisoner or offender on community supervision has been returned to the prison, the paroled prisoner shall be given an opportunity to appear before the board, and the board may after an opportunity has been given, or in case the prisoner has not yet been returned, declare the parolee or offender on community supervision delinquent. The prisoner may be thereafter imprisoned in the prison for a period equal to the prisoner's unexpired maximum term of sentence at the time the parole was granted, unless sooner released or discharged.

#### Section 31-418. Community supervision fee; deposit; community corrections enhancement fund; drug testing costs

A.

1. Provide the framework for the promotion of public safety and protect the rights of victims through the control and regulation of the interstate movement of offenders in the community.

2. Provide for the effective tracking, supervision and rehabilitation of these offenders by the sending and receiving states.

3. Equitably distribute the costs, benefits and obligations of the compact among the compacting states.

C. In addition, this compact will do all of the following:

A. Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding on each compacting state.  A compacting state may withdraw from the compact by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute that enacted the compact.  The effective date of withdrawal is the effective date of the repeal.  The withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chairperson of the interstate commission in writing on the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state.  The interstate commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within sixty days of its receipt thereof.  The withdrawing state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extend beyond the effective date of withdrawal. Reinstatement following withdrawal of any compacting state shall occur on the withdrawing state reenacting the compact or on such later date determined by the interstate commission.

The grounds for default include failure of a compacting state to perform obligations or responsibilities imposed on it by this compact, interstate commission bylaws or duly promulgated rules.  The interstate commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the interstate commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default.  The interstate commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default.  If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the interstate commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed in this subsection, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact on an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within sixty days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the interstate commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature and the state council of the termination.  The defaulting state is responsible for all assessments, obligations and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination.  The interstate commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed on between the interstate commission and the defaulting state. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state requires both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the interstate commission pursuant to the rules.

C. The interstate commission, by majority vote of the members, may initiate legal action in the United States district court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the interstate commission, in the federal district where the interstate commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact or its duly promulgated rules and bylaws, against any compacting state in default.  If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of the litigation including reasonable attorney fees.

F. If any provision of this compact exceeds the constitutional limits imposed on the legislature of any compacting state, the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction sought to be conferred by the provision on the interstate commission is ineffective and the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction shall remain in the compacting state and shall be exercised by the agency to which the obligations, duties, powers or jurisdiction are delegated by law in effect at the time this compact becomes effective.

#### Section 31-467.05. Extradition; retrieval

### Article 6 - Agreement on Detainers

#### Section 31-481. Agreement; authorization; contents

The agreement on detainers is entered into by this state with all other jurisdictions legally joining such agreement in the form substantially as follows:

The Agreement on Detainers

The contracting states solemnly agree that:

Article I

The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation. Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations or complaints. The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures. It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

Article II

As used in this agreement:

(a) "State" shall mean a state of the United States; the United States of America; a territory or possession of the United States; the District of Columbia; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.

(b) "Sending state" shall mean a state in which a prisoner is incarcerated at the time that he initiates a request for final disposition pursuant to Article III hereof or at the time that a request for custody or availability is initiated pursuant to Article IV hereof.

(c) "Receiving state" shall mean the state in which trial is to be had on an indictment, information or complaint pursuant to Article III or Article IV hereof.

Article III

(a) Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment information or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he shall be brought to trial within one hundred eighty days after he shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his imprisonment and his request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information or complaint: provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance. The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.

(b) The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of him, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.

(c) The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him and shall also inform him of his right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information or complaint on which the detainer is based.

(d) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed. The warden, commissioner of corrections or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner. Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate. If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

(e) Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and a waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him, after completion of his term of imprisonment in the sending state. The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his body in any court where his presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.

(f) Escape from custody by the prisoner subsequent to his execution of the request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall void the request.

Article IV

(a) The appropriate officer of the jurisdiction in which an untried indictment, information or complaint is pending shall be entitled to have a prisoner against whom he has lodged a detainer and who is serving a term of imprisonment in any party state made available in accordance with Article V(a) hereof upon presentation of a written request for temporary custody or availability to the appropriate authorities of the state in which the prisoner is incarcerated: provided that the court having jurisdiction of such indictment, information or complaint shall have duly approved, recorded and transmitted the request: and provided further that there shall be a period of thirty days after receipt by the appropriate authorities before the request be honored, within which period the governor of the sending state may disapprove the request for temporary custody or availability, either upon his own motion or upon motion of the prisoner.

(b) Upon receipt of the officer's written request as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, the appropriate authorities having the prisoner in custody shall furnish the officer with a certificate stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner. Said authorities simultaneously shall furnish all other officers and appropriate courts in the receiving state who have lodged detainers against the prisoner with similar certificates and with notices informing them of the request for custody or availability and of the reasons therefor.

(c) In respect of any proceeding made possible by this Article, trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state, but for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.

(d) Nothing contained in this Article shall be construed to deprive any prisoner of any right which he may have to contest the legality of his delivery as provided in paragraph (a) hereof, but such delivery may not be opposed or denied on the ground that the executive authority of the sending state has not affirmatively consented to or ordered such delivery.

(e) If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the original place of imprisonment pursuant to Article V(e) hereof, such indictment, information or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

Article V

(a) In response to a request made under Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate authority in a sending state shall offer to deliver temporary custody of such prisoner to the appropriate authority in the state where such indictment, information or complaint is pending against such person in order that speedy and efficient prosecution may be had. If the request for final disposition is made by the prisoner, the offer of temporary custody shall accompany the written notice provided for in Article III of this agreement. In the case of a federal prisoner, the appropriate authority in the receiving state shall be entitled to temporary custody as provided by this agreement or to the prisoner's presence in federal custody at the place for trial, whichever custodial arrangement may be approved by the custodian.

(b) The officer or other representative of a state accepting an offer of temporary custody shall present the following upon demand:

(1) Proper identification and evidence of his authority to act for the state into whose temporary custody the prisoner is to be given.

(2) A duly certified copy of the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged and on the basis of which the request for temporary custody of the prisoner has been made.

(c) If the appropriate authority shall refuse or fail to accept temporary custody of said person, or in the event that an action on the indictment, information or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in Article III or Article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect.

(d) The temporary custody referred to in this agreement shall be only for the purpose of permitting prosecution on the charge or charges contained in one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints which form the basis of the detainer or detainers or for prosecution on any other charge or charges arising out of the same transaction. Except for his attendance at court and while being transported to or from any place at which his presence may be required, the prisoner shall be held in a suitable jail or other facility regularly used for persons awaiting prosecution.

(e) At the earliest practicable time consonant with the purposes of this agreement, the prisoner shall be returned to the sending state.

(f) During the continuance of temporary custody or while the prisoner is otherwise being made available for trial as required by this agreement, the time being served on the sentence shall continue to run but good time shall be earned by the prisoner only if, and to the extent that, the law and practice of the jurisdiction which imposed the sentence may allow.

(g) For all purposes other than that for which temporary custody as provided in this agreement is exercised, the prisoner shall be deemed to remain in the custody of and subject to the jurisdiction of the sending state and any escape from temporary custody may be dealt with in the same manner as an escape from the original place of imprisonment or in any other manner permitted by law.

(h) From the time that a party state receives custody of a prisoner pursuant to this agreement until such prisoner is returned to the territory and custody of the sending state, the state in which the one or more untried indictments, informations or complaints are pending or in which trial is being had shall be responsible for the prisoner and shall also pay all costs of transporting, caring for, keeping and returning the prisoner. The provisions of this paragraph shall govern unless the states concerned shall have entered into a supplementary agreement providing for a different allocation of costs and responsibilities as between or among themselves. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to alter or affect any internal relationship among the departments, agencies and officers of and in the government of a party state, or between a party state and its subdivisions, as to the payment of costs, or responsibilities therefor.

Article VI

(a) In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in Articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of said time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter.

(b) No provision of this agreement, and no remedy made available by this agreement, shall apply to any person who is adjudged to be mentally ill.

Article VII

Each state party to this agreement shall designate an officer who, acting jointly with like officers of other party states, shall promulgate rules and regulations to carry out more effectively the terms and provisions of this agreement, and who shall provide, within and without the state, information necessary to the effective operation of this agreement.

Article VIII

This agreement shall enter into full force and effect as to a party state when such state has enacted the same into law. A state party to this agreement may withdraw herefrom by enacting a statute repealing the same. However, the withdrawal of any state shall not affect the status of any proceedings already initiated by inmates or by state officers at the time such withdrawal takes effect, nor shall it affect their rights in respect thereof.

Article IX

This agreement shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this agreement shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this agreement is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any party state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this agreement shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state party hereto, the agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

#### Section 31-482. Matters pertaining to agreement

A. Every person who has been imprisoned in a prison or institution in this state and who escapes or attempts to escape while in the custody of an officer of this or another state in another state pursuant to the agreement on detainers is deemed to have violated section 13-2503 or 13-2504 and is punishable as provided therein.

B. It shall be lawful and mandatory upon the warden or other official in charge of a penal or correctional institution in this state to give over the person of any inmate thereof whenever so required by the operation of the agreement on detainer. Such official shall inform such inmate of his rights provided in paragraph (a) of article IV of the agreement on detainers.

C. The administrator, in accordance with the interstate probation and parole compacts, shall administer the agreement as prescribed by section 31-481.

D. When, pursuant to the agreement on detainers, a person in actual confinement under sentence of another jurisdiction is brought before an Arizona court and sentenced by the judge to serve an Arizona sentence concurrently with the sentence of the other jurisdiction, the board of executive clemency and members thereof may meet in such other jurisdiction, or enter into cooperative arrangements with corresponding agencies in the other jurisdiction, as necessary to carry out the term-fixing and parole functions.
