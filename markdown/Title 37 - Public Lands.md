Purchasers of water under this subsection shall reimburse the department, on a pro rata basis, for all costs and charges, including capital costs and administrative expenses, incurred by the department under its contract for the purchase and delivery of central Arizona project water under subsection A of this section.

F. The department, with the approval of the state selection board, may enter into contracts to undertake or authorize the storage of central Arizona project water for which the department has signed a municipal and industrial water service subcontract, but that the department has not otherwise allocated for use.

#### Section 37-231. State lands subject to sale; rights reserved in lands sold; state lands not subject to sale; development agreements

A. All state lands, except as otherwise provided for in this title, including all improvements made or placed on or connected with state lands, shall be subject to appraisal and sale as provided in this title.

B. Any person over eighteen years of age is entitled to purchase any of the state lands.

C. All sales, grants, deeds or patents to any state lands sold between July 9, 1954 and March 18, 1968 shall be subject to and shall contain a reservation to the state of an undivided one-sixteenth of all oil, gases and other hydrocarbon substances, coal or stone, metals, minerals, fossils and fertilizer of every name and description, together with all uranium, all thorium, or any other material which is or may be determined by the laws of the state or the United States or decisions of courts to be peculiarly essential to the production of fissionable materials, whether or not of commercial value, subject to the following:

1. For the purpose of promoting the sale of state lands and the more active cooperation of the owner of the soil, and to facilitate the development of its mineral resources, the state constitutes the purchaser of the land its agent for the purposes specified in this section, and in consideration hereof, relinquishes to and vests in the purchaser of the state land an undivided fifteen-sixteenths of all oil, gas and the value thereof which may be upon or within any state land purchased after July 9, 1954 and before March 18, 1968.

2. The purchaser of the soil may sell or lease to any person, firm or corporation the oil and gas and other minerals which may be on or in the land, upon terms and conditions the purchaser and the owner deem best, subject to the provisions and reservations of this section, but the lessee or purchaser shall pay to the state an undivided one-sixteenth of the mineral produced or the value of the mineral produced at the well or mine as determined by the state land department.

3. Upon discovery of oil and gas in paying quantities on land adjoining state lands purchased under the authority of this section, the purchaser or the purchaser's lessee shall drill and produce all wells necessary to protect the land so purchased from drainage by wells on lands in which the state has no royalty interest, or has a lesser royalty interest. If the purchaser or the purchaser's lessee fails to protect against such drainage, the state, acting through the state land department, may, three months after demand therefor in writing by the state land department to such purchaser and the purchaser's lessee, enter upon such lands and drill all wells necessary to protect the state against such drainage.

4. The interest reserved by the state in any state lands sold may be committed to a drilling unit or cooperative or unit plans of development and operation of oil and gas pools with the United States, its agencies and its and their lessees and permittees, and with private owners and persons holding oil and gas leases on private lands or on state lands. The state land department may, insofar as the interest of the state may be affected thereby, join in and consent to any such plan on behalf of the state. Such agreements shall provide for the equitable division on an agreed basis of the oil and gas produced from the unit, but no such agreement shall relieve any operator from the obligation to develop reasonably the lands and leases as a whole committed thereto. The royalties to which the state is entitled on production from land purchased under this section shall be computed only on that part of the production allocated to such tract. When the agreements made under this section provide for the return of gas to a formation underlying the unit, they may provide that no royalties are required to be paid on the gas so returned.

D. State lands known to contain oil, gases and other hydrocarbon substances, geothermal resources, coal or stone, metals, minerals, fossils and fertilizer of every name and description, in paying quantities, or uranium, thorium or any other material which is or may be determined by the laws of the state the United States or decisions of court to be peculiarly essential to the production of fissionable materials, whether or not of commercial value, and state lands adjoining lands upon which there are producing oil, gas or geothermal wells or adjoining lands known to contain any of such substances in paying quantities, or uranium, thorium or any other material peculiarly essential to the production of fissionable materials, whether or not of commercial value, shall not be sold. The prohibition against sale shall not operate to prevent the sale of lands known to contain, in paying quantities, common variety minerals as defined in section 27-271 or to prevent the sale of lands where the state does not own such substances, minerals or metals in the lands sought to be sold. The provisions of this subsection shall not prohibit the sale of such lands located within the exterior boundaries of an incorporated city or town, in which case the commissioner may offer the land for sale, provided the land shall be used solely for a public purpose. Such land shall revert to the state if it is used other than for a public purpose.

E. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C of this section, all state lands sold after March 18, 1968 shall be sold with the reservation that all oil, gas, other hydrocarbon substances, helium or other substances of a gaseous nature, geothermal resources, coal, metals, minerals, fossils, fertilizer of every name and description, together with all uranium, all thorium or any other material which is or may be determined by the laws of the United States or of this state, or decisions of court, to be peculiarly essential to the production of fissionable materials, whether or not of commercial value, and the exclusive right thereto, on, in, or under such land, shall be and remain and be reserved in and retained by the state, regardless of any sale under this section and the issuance of any certificate of purchase to any purchaser of state lands pursuant to this section, provided, that the reservation shall not include common variety minerals as defined in section 27-271, subject to the following:

1. The state land department shall adopt rules providing for the protection of the patentee or contract purchaser of state lands, or their successors in interest, and the state of Arizona, against damage to the lands, livestock, water, crops, or other tangible improvements on lands held by such patentee or contract purchaser, and suffered by reason of the use or occupation of such lands by lessees or permittees engaged in mining and oil, gas and geothermal resource exploration and development under leases or permits executed by the department. The state land department may, at any time, require each of its lessees or permittees to execute a bond in a reasonable principal amount conditioned upon payment for all such damages.

2. The mineral rights reserved to the state in the lands sold shall be closed to entry and location as a mineral claim or claims, but the department may issue, upon application, mineral exploration permits embracing the reserved mineral rights when such issuance is deemed in the best interest of the state, provided that the surface owner or owners shall have the first right of refusal to acquire such mineral exploration permits.

3. Is known to be a second time applicant on the same property that was previously offered at public auction.

D.

In establishing the amount to be paid for the partial patent, the commissioner shall take into account the amount of the down payment made on the entire tract.  This paragraph does not affect certificates of purchase issued before September 30, 1988.

3. When paid, the partial purchase price shall be credited on the total purchase price stated in the certificate of purchase. The department may issue a supplement to the certificate of purchase deleting the land patented and reducing the amount of each of the remaining annual installments to that amount which, when all installments are paid in full, will discharge the entire unpaid balance due on the original certificate of purchase.

B. If a patent for such lands pursuant to section 37-251 has not been issued within seven years after the department issued a certificate of purchase for such lands under section 37-244, all lands sold under the provisions of this article shall be taxed, and the taxes assessed on those lands shall be collected and enforced as against other lands.  The department shall not issue a patent under section 37-251, subsection A or B until all taxes that are due on the lands have been paid.

C. Any material false statement or concealment of facts made by an applicant, his authorized agent or his attorney in the application to lease, which, if known to the department, would have prevented issuance of the lease in the form or to the person issued, shall be grounds for cancellation of a lease issued upon such application.

D. No lessee shall use lands leased to him except for the purpose for which the lands are leased.

E. No lessee shall sublease lands leased to him without written permission of the state land department.

#### Section 37-281.01. Lease of state lands for grazing purposes; notice

A. All state lands are subject to lease as provided in this article for a term of not more than ten years for grazing purposes without public auction.

B. The department shall give notice of the availability of expiring grazing leases on state lands by advertisement, published in December of each year, at least one year in advance of the expiration date of any grazing lease. The notice shall be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation, indicating the number of leases expiring, the county or counties where each lease is located and the location of posting the notice where additional information may be obtained.  The newspaper that prints the notice may also post the notice on an internet web site that aggregates legal notices of ten or more Arizona newspapers.  The department shall post notice of expiring leases by lease number, abbreviated legal description of the lease area, carrying capacity, expiration date and application information in the following locations:

1. In each department office.

2. On the department's internet web site.

3. In the office or offices of the county board of supervisors where the land is located.

4. In United States bureau of land management offices in this state where posting is allowed.

#### Section 37-281.02. Leasing state lands for commercial purposes for more than ten years

A. All state lands are subject to lease as provided in this article for a term in excess of ten years, but not more than ninety-nine years, for commercial purposes to the highest and best bidder at public auction. The auction shall be conducted at the place, in the manner, and after the notice by publication provided for sales of such lands except as otherwise provided in this section. For commercial leases of state land more than three miles outside the boundaries of incorporated cities and towns having a population of ten thousand persons or less or more than five miles outside the boundaries of incorporated cities and towns having a population in excess of ten thousand persons, the department shall cooperate with the county or counties in which the land to be leased is located in considering the intended uses.  The leases shall be granted in accordance with the Constitution of Arizona, state laws and the rules of the department.

B. If the department determines that leasing of the land is in the best interest of the state, the tract or tracts shall be offered for lease to the highest and best bidder.

C. Each offer for lease shall reserve the right in the department to reject any and all bids and to again offer the tract or tracts for lease if the bids received are not acceptable to the department.

D. Upon announcement of the successful bidder, the first year's annual rental shall be paid by cashier's check. The successful bidder shall also pay the cost of the publication and reasonable expenses of the sale, and such funds shall be subject to the provisions of section 37-107.  If there are bids exceeding the minimum bid accepted at the auction, the successful bidder has until 5:00 p.m. of the fifth business day following the date of the auction to deposit a cashier's check with the department for the amount exceeding the minimum bid for the first year's rent. The failure to pay the first year's rent at the time of the auction or to pay the amount exceeding the minimum bid by 5:00 p.m. on the fifth business day after the auction results in forfeiture of the lease and all monies paid. In the event of forfeiture the commissioner may declare that the bid placed before the final bid accepted is the highest bid, and that bidder has five business days after notification by the department to pay by cashier's check all amounts due under this section and section 37-107.

E. Before acceptance of any bid for a lease under this section, the department shall establish to its satisfaction the responsibility of the bidder.

F. Each lease shall be for a term in excess of ten years, but not more than ninety-nine years, as determined by the department, and shall provide for an annual rental of not less than the appraised fair market rental value of the land. The department shall establish a rental adjustment formula by which the rental provided for in the lease is subject to adjustment after periods of time specified in the lease. A period of time shall not exceed five years. The department shall include a rental adjustment formula in each lease.  The rental for the first five-year period and the rental adjustment formula for that lease shall be established by the department prior to the call for bids. The department shall publish in the call for bids the rental for the first period and the rental adjustment formula for that lease.

G. A lease issued under this section may include an amortization schedule to be used to determine the value of improvements when the lease is terminated.

H. All provisions of this title applicable to state lands and the lease thereof, not in conflict with the provisions of this section, shall apply to leasing and leases issued under this section.

I. The department shall require an applicant to pay a deposit before beginning to process an application to lease state trust lands if the applicant did not bid at an auction where the applicant initiated the process.  The deposit shall be based on the approximate first year rental plus administrative expenses and shall be deposited in a noninterest bearing account.  Monies must be deposited at the time of filing an application or at a time determined by the commissioner. If the applicant is not the successful bidder at public auction, the department shall refund the deposit to the applicant. If the applicant is the successful bidder, the department shall apply the deposit to the rental price at auction. If there are no bids at the time of the auction, the department shall transfer the deposit made by the applicant to the appropriate trust beneficiary.

 

#### Section 37-281.03. Leasing land along Colorado river from United States; subleasing requirements; limitations

A. The state land department may lease from the United States or its authorized agencies, for park, recreational and wildlife purposes, lands under the jurisdiction of the bureau of reclamation, which are located along the Colorado river embracing the area from Davis dam to the international line, for such terms and under such conditions as the United States or its agencies may provide.

B. The state land department may sublease lands leased to the department, as provided in subsection A, for park, recreational and wildlife purposes to the state parks board, the game and fish commission or to any political subdivision of the state.

#### Section 37-281.04. Default of lease of state land; assignment to cities and towns

A. If a default of a lease of state land made pursuant to this article occurs during the first year of the lease agreement or within four years of the first anniversary date determined by the lease agreement, the lease may be assigned to a city or town by the commissioner pursuant to this section if the following conditions are met:

1. The state land is located either entirely within or adjacent to the city or town.

2. No portion of the state land is contained within any other city or town.

3. The city or town consents to be bound by all of the terms and conditions of the lease.

B. If a notice of default has been sent to the lessee and the lessee's registered mortgagees or lienholders and the default has not been cured in accordance with the procedures and time periods in section 37-289, the commissioner, on written request of a city or town, may assign the lease to the city or town without the consent of the defaulting lessee if the city or town cures any outstanding default.  An assignment made pursuant to this subsection is an alternative to cancellation of the lease as provided in section 37-289, subsection B.  If the commissioner grants the written request of the city or town for assignment as provided in this subsection, the commissioner shall make a formal order assigning the lease to the city or town, and a copy of the order shall be mailed to the last known post office address of the defaulting lessee and the defaulting lessee's registered mortgagees and lienholders. The defaulting lessee shall be permitted to remove the defaulting lessee's improvements, if any, at any time within sixty days after the date of assignment.

C. The defaulting lessee and the defaulting lessee's registered mortgagees and lienholders may appeal an assignment order pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6. If no appeal is made within the prescribed time or if no notice is filed with the department pursuant to section 37-255, subsection C, the order becomes final and the assignment shall be shown on the records of the department.

D. Nothing in this section authorizes a city, town, person or legal entity that has rights under this section to claim, represent, assert or imply any ownership interest or right of leasehold interest, present or future, in any negotiations with a state or federal agency without the consent of the private lessee before having been granted an assignment of a lease pursuant to subsection C of this section.

#### Section 37-282. Duty of lessees to cooperate with state land department in making classifications and appraisals

Lessees of state lands shall cooperate with the state land department in making classifications and appraisals. Lessees shall furnish information requested by the department pertaining to the use of the lands proposed by lessee and in connection with other property held by the lessee as part of a unit. Information furnished by lessee, except that pertaining to state lands, shall be confidential and shall not be subject to public inspection.

#### Section 37-282.01. Mass appraisals; notice; procedure; definitions

A. Before undertaking a mass appraisal pursuant to section 37-132, subsection A, paragraph 5, the commissioner shall:

1. Notify in writing all lessees, permittees and right-of-way grantees currently occupying state land for the use to which the mass appraisal would apply and solicit comments from the affected parties and any valuation information, including comparables, that the affected parties might voluntarily provide.

2. Notify in writing known industry, trade and professional organizations that typically represent occupants of state lands for the use to which the mass appraisal would apply and solicit comments from the organizations and any valuation information, including comparables, that the organizations might voluntarily provide.

3. Provide the affected parties and organizations ninety days to submit written comments and valuation information, including comparable data.

B. Valuation information, including comparable data, submitted to the department pursuant to subsection A of this section must include information typically used for valuation purposes.  The commissioner shall consider all valuation information, including comparable data.

C. Industry, trade and professional organizations that do not receive notice pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section and that wish to provide comments and valuation information, including comparable data, have ninety days from the date of the notice provided in subsection A of this section to identify themselves in writing to the department and provide comments and valuation information, including comparable data.

D. The commissioner shall base mass appraisals on valuation information including comparables that are consistent with the market for that land use in this state, to the extent that adequate valuation information, including comparable data, is available.  The commissioner shall consider whether there are different markets for that land use within different areas of the state, including urban, suburban and rural, and require that these different markets are appropriately addressed in the mass appraisal.

E. In using valuation information, including comparable data, on lands in preparing a mass appraisal, the commissioner shall take into account, if applicable, the specific terms and conditions of leases, permits and right-of-way grants affecting the lands, including:

1. Any costs incurred by the occupier of the land to prepare the land for use, including acquisition of rights-of-way for access to the land and extension of utility services necessary to use the land.

2. Whether the occupier of the land may subsequently sublease, permit or license the land or improvements on the land to obtain third-party revenue and the extent to which the improvement being sublet, permitted or licensed is leased, permitted or licensed to the occupier of the land.

F. At least sixty days before the commissioner submits a mass appraisal to the board of appeals for approval, rejection or modification, the commissioner shall notify in writing all parties who were notified or provided comments and valuation information pursuant to subsection A or C of this section and shall make available on the department's website a copy of the mass appraisal to be acted on by the board of appeals.  The commissioner shall provide a hard copy of the mass appraisal to any person who requests it pursuant to section 37-102, subsection F.  The notice shall advise the recipients of their right to appear before the board of appeals regarding the mass appraisal.

G. The commissioner shall adjust the mass appraisal at any time if the commissioner determines that significant changes in market conditions or technology have occurred or that other changed conditions would materially affect the valuation of land uses subject to the mass appraisal.  Before modifying a mass appraisal, the commissioner shall give written notice to holders of leases, permits and right-of-way grants affected by the mass appraisal and to the persons identified in subsection A of this section.  The commissioner shall reappraise any mass appraisal that has not been adjusted in a ten-year period.

H. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Comparables" means similar transactions, within a relevant time period, between unrelated parties involving similar uses of similar property in which none of the differences, if any, between the transactions could materially affect the valuation or in which reasonably accurate adjustments may be made to eliminate the effect of the differences.

2. "Mass appraisal" means an appraisal that the commissioner proposes to use to set rental or fees for multiple applications from multiple persons for a specific use of state lands by lease, permit or right-of-way grant.  Multiple applications for similar land uses in a defined geographic region that are appraised by a single appraiser shall not be considered a mass appraisal.

 

#### Section 37-283. Subleases by grazing lessee; limitation upon grazing use; sublease surcharge

A. A grazing lessee shall not sublease his lease or sell or lease pasturage to lands included in his lease, without written permission from the state land department. A grazing lessee, his sublessee or users under pasturage agreement shall not graze, without written permission of the department, in excess of the carrying capacity as previously determined by the department, upon state lands under lease or being used by such persons, within the exterior boundaries of any one ranch unit or units in the same general locality jointly operated. If permission is granted for such excess, the department shall assess and collect the rental for the excess on the rental basis provided for in this article.

B. In addition to the annual rental on grazing lands established pursuant to section 37-285, grazing subleases are subject to a surcharge that is equal to twenty-five per cent of the annual rental on grazing land, multiplied by the number of animal unit months to be grazed on the subleased state trust land. The surcharge shall be assessed only for that period of time the state trust land is subleased. The surcharge shall be paid to the department when the annual rental is due, or upon receiving department permission to sublease if the sublease is approved after the annual rental is due.

#### Section 37-284. Conflicting short-term lease applications; preference rights

A. A conflicting application for an existing lease for a term of not more than ten years shall be filed at least two hundred seventy days but not more than one year before the expiration date on the lease.  The conflicting application must be accompanied by a list of nonremovable improvements on the leased lands on file with the department, including fences.  The conflicting applicant must post a surety bond or other form of security in the amount of two thousand five hundred dollars or twenty per cent of the rental payments over the term of the current lease, whichever is greater.  The department shall calculate the amount of the security within thirty days after receiving the conflicting application, and the conflicting applicant must post the security within thirty days after the department determines the amount.  If the conflicting applicant is unsuccessful or withdraws the application, the department shall return the security to the applicant.  If the conflicting applicant is successful, the security shall be applied against the value of the nonremovable improvements.

B. When the department receives a conflicting application, the department shall give the existing lessee thirty days' notice to file an application for renewal pursuant to this section.

C. If two or more applicants apply to lease the same land for a term of not more than ten years, the department shall approve the application of the one who, after investigation or hearing, appears to have the best right and equity to the lease.  The order of filing shall not be a controlling factor in deciding who is entitled to the lease.  If it appears that none of the applicants has any right or equities superior to those of another that would outweigh an offer of additional rent, and if it is in the best interest of the trust, the department, at a stated time and after due notice to all applicants, may receive bids submitted in accordance with rules of the department.  If one of the competing applicants is the existing lessee who has a preferred right of renewal pursuant to section 37-291, the department shall extend the preferred right of renewal to the existing lessee if the existing lessee offers a bid matching the highest bid. The department shall approve the application of the bidder who in all respects is eligible to receive a lease upon the land and will pay the highest annual rental, or the department may reject all bids.

D. Before the department issues a lease to the successful bidder, the successful bidder shall pay one full year of rent and, unless all parties agree to an extended payment schedule, the appraised value of any nonremovable improvements pursuant to section 37-322.01.  If the successful bidder does not pay one full year of rent or the value of any nonremovable improvements within thirty days after the department requests payment, the department may offer the lease to the next best bidder.  A lease that is issued pursuant to this section shall require the lessee to pay annual rent that is equal to the amount of annual rent bid, unless a reappraisal or rental adjustment requires a higher amount.

E. Any person residing upon contiguous land for which the person has an allowed United States homestead entry or for which the person has received a patent from the United States upon a homestead entry, upon application, shall have a preferred right to lease the amount of contiguous state land necessary for personal use.

F. Any person lawfully occupying any lands, the title to which is acquired by the state by operation of law, shall have a preference right to lease the occupied land provided application to do so is made within thirty days from and after written notice by the department to such occupant of the acquisition of title.

 

#### Section 37-285. Rental rates for grazing and other lands; grazing land valuation commission; reclassification and reappraisal; definitions

A. An agricultural, commercial or homesite lease shall provide for an annual rental of not less than the appraised rental value of the land, and never less than five cents per acre per year.  The rental provided in such leases is subject to adjustment each year.

B. A grazing lease shall provide for an annual rental of the grazing land as computed under this section.  All grazing land shall be classified and appraised on the basis of its forage and annual carrying capacity, measured in animal unit months.  The annual rental rate for grazing land shall be the amount determined by multiplying the number of animal unit months to be grazed on the lands by the true value rental rate per animal unit month as established by the commissioner. The rental rate per animal unit month is the rental rate determined by the commissioner based on the recommendations of the grazing land valuation commission under subsection E of this section.

C. Before September 1, 1994, and at other times the commissioner may propose, but not more frequently than every five years, the governor shall appoint a grazing land valuation commission consisting of five members appointed by the governor pursuant to section 38-211.  The commission shall serve for a period of one year from the date the members assume office during which period the commission shall complete the appraisal. The commission shall consist of the following members, each of whom shall have experience in analyzing and valuing the use of forage on grazing land:

1. One member who is a professional appraiser and who is certified in this state.

2. One member who is a professor and who serves on the faculty of the college of agriculture at the university of Arizona.

3. One member who is a retired employee of a financial institution that is actively engaged in agricultural lending.

4. One member who primarily derives income from livestock grazing and who does not hold a state lease.

5. One member who is a conservationist and who represents a natural resource conservation district in this state.

D. Each member of the grazing land valuation commission shall receive compensation at the rate of one hundred dollars for each meeting.  Each member of the commission shall receive reimbursement for expenses pursuant to title 38, chapter 4, article 2.

E. The grazing land valuation commission may employ a person who is experienced in analyzing and valuing the use of forage on grazing land and who, together with the members of the commission, shall gather the information that is necessary to prepare an appraisal to determine the true value of the use of forage on state grazing land and shall prepare this appraisal using both the market and income approaches.  The appraisal report shall recommend a grazing fee that will equal the true value as recommended by the commission.  The information and work products gathered in preparing the appraisal shall be available to the public.  In determining the rental rate using the market approach the commission shall determine the typical lease of two years or more of private grazing land located in this state during normal years.  The commission shall compare all factors that make up the bundle of rights and obligations in the typical private lease with the factors that make up the bundle of rights and obligations in the typical state lease.  The commission shall document all adjustments, calculations and assumptions made in reaching a conclusion of true rental value for the state land grazing fee and shall determine economic benefit, burden or value attributable to each of these factors.  These factors shall include the following:

1. All services, equipment and water rights provided by the lessor or lessee.

2. All improvements typically constructed and maintained to facilitate or enhance the use of the land for livestock grazing, wildlife, hunting or recreation.

3. All management and protection services that are typically provided.

4. The tenure, right to renew, assignability, right to reimbursement for improvements, responsibility for property taxes, right of others to share in the use of the land and ability to control access by others.

5. The size, location, accessibility, condition and carrying capacity of the land being leased and all related costs.

F. The commissioner's decision under this section may be appealed by any affected lessee to the board of appeals pursuant to section 37-215, and, except as provided in section 41-1092.08, subsection H, the decision of the board of appeals may be appealed to the superior court pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

G. The commissioner may make a reclassification or reappraisal, or both, at any time.  If a reclassification or reappraisal, or both, is made pursuant to a request of a lessee, before expiration of the lease, the lessee shall pay a reclassification fee prescribed pursuant to section 37-107 plus the actual expenses incurred in making a reappraisal.

H. The department may authorize nonuse for part or all of the grazing use upon request of the lessee at least sixty days prior to the beginning of the billing date.  The rental fee shall be based on the animal unit months used, but the total rental fee for partial or full nonuse shall not be less than five cents per acre per year.

I. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Animal unit" means one weaned beef animal over six months of age, or one horse, or five goats, or five sheep, or the equivalent.

2. "Animal unit month" means one animal unit grazing for one month.

 

#### Section 37-286. Execution of leases by land department; covenants; assignment of lease by lessee

A. Leases shall be signed by the commissioner and sealed with the seal of the state land department, and shall contain covenants that the lessee will not permit any loss, cause any waste in or upon the land, or cut, waste or allow to be cut or wasted, any timber or standing trees thereon without written consent of the department, except for fuel for domestic uses, or for necessary improvements on the land, and that the lessee will surrender peaceable possession of the lands at the expiration of the lease. Nothing in this section shall be construed to permit the cutting of saw timber for any purpose without the written consent of the department.

B. A lessee of state lands who is not in default in rent, and who has kept and performed all the conditions of his lease, may, with the written consent of the department, assign the lease, but a lessee who assigns a holding lease shall pay to the department one-half of the consideration received for the assignment.

#### Section 37-286.01. Duty to exclude unauthorized livestock bond; damages; injunction

A. Notwithstanding the provisions of title 3, chapter 11, article 8, if the commissioner leases land located within the boundaries of a fenced range to a person other than the prior state grazing lessee, the new lessee shall exclude unauthorized livestock grazing by fencing the exterior boundary of the state land or by any other means that the commissioner considers to be suitable. The commissioner may require the new lessee to post a bond sufficient to cover the cost of the fence construction.

B. If the new lessee referred to in subsection A of this section fails to fence the exterior boundaries of the state land, or otherwise exclude unauthorized livestock from the state land, within the time for compliance with the fencing requirements set forth in the lease conditions prescribed by the department, the failure constitutes a default on the lease and the new lessee is subject to default proceedings pursuant to section 37-289 and, if a bond was required pursuant to subsection A of this section, the bond may be forfeited on cancellation of the lease.

C. The commissioner shall include the requirements imposed by this section in the terms of all new leases to which this section applies.

D. If the commissioner withdraws state land from lease pursuant to section 37-132, subsection A, paragraph 11, because the land may pose a threat to human health and cannot be used for livestock grazing, and the land is located within the boundaries of a fenced range, either the commissioner or the party responsible for causing the land to be withdrawn shall be responsible for excluding unauthorized livestock from grazing on the land. The lessee may not exercise the preferred right pursuant to section 37-291 to renew a lease on the land withdrawn.

E. Until livestock are excluded from the state land pursuant to this section, or during the pendency of the lease default for failure to exclude livestock pursuant to subsection B of this section, the unauthorized grazing of livestock on state land within the fenced range shall not constitute trespass pursuant to section 37-501 or wilful trespass pursuant to section 37-502, subsection A or B, but shall constitute prima facie evidence of casual or involuntary trespass pursuant to section 37-502, subsection A. The monetary damages for the unauthorized grazing of livestock under this subsection shall be limited to the greater of the carrying capacity of the state land for the period of unauthorized grazing as expressed in animal unit months or the actual animal unit months of unauthorized grazing actually determined to have occurred on the state land, multiplied by the grazing fee, as most recently determined by the state grazing land valuation commission pursuant to section 37-285, subsection E. The commissioner may seek to enjoin the unauthorized grazing of livestock, and the provisions of sections 37-501 and 37-502 apply on the occurrence of any of the following:

1. The number of unauthorized livestock exceeds the carrying capacity of the fenced range that includes the state land.

2. The owner of the unauthorized livestock does not agree to pay the monetary damages authorized by this subsection.

3. The lease is canceled pursuant to subsection B of this section and the owner of the unauthorized livestock fails to apply for the lease when requested by the commissioner or accept the offer by the commissioner for a lease on the state land.

4. The owner of unauthorized livestock intentionally hinders the fencing of state land pursuant to subsection A or D of this section.

F. Nothing in subsection E of this section shall limit the ability of the commissioner to enjoin unauthorized activities other than grazing that may damage or decrease the value of the state land or otherwise impede the management of the state land.

#### Section 37-287. Reservation of rights in state land leases

A. Unless the rights and interests described in this section are specifically included in a particular lease, all leases of state lands shall expressly except and reserve to the state:

1. All oils, gases, geothermal resources, coal, ores, minerals, fertilizer and fossils of every kind, which may be in or upon the land leased.

2. Any legal claim existing or which may be established under the mineral land laws of the United States or the state.

3. The right to enter upon the land for the purpose of exploring for those commodities or extracting any or all of such commodities from the land.

4. The right to relinquish to the United States lands needed for irrigation works in connection with a government reclamation project, and to grant or dispose of rights-of-way and sites for canals, reservoirs, dams, power or irrigating plants or works, railroads, tramways, transmission lines or any other purpose or use on or over the land.

B. The reservations of rights required in subsection A do not apply to existing or future leases under article 5.1 of this chapter, except as required by the state constitution, the enabling act or the commissioner acting in the best interests of the state lands.

C. If the state reserves the rights described in subsection A, the lease shall provide for reasonable compensation to the lessee for any damage resulting from the exercise of those rights.

#### Section 37-287.01. Default on long-term lease; forfeiture and cancellation of lease; extension of time for payments; penalty and interest on delinquent rent

A. If a lessee of a lease in excess of ten years defaults in a payment of rent, as provided in the lease, or fails to comply with a condition, covenant or requirement of the lease, the lease and the lessee's rights under the lease are subject to forfeiture and cancellation as provided by this section and section 37-289. Within sixty days after default or failure the department shall notify the lessee of the default or failure by certified mail to the lessee's last known address of record with the department.

B. On the written request of a lessee of a lease in excess of ten years, the commissioner may extend the time for payment of the delinquent amount for a period of not more than five years on terms that the commissioner considers to be appropriate as follows:

1. The commissioner may grant an extension in response to a request made within sixty days before the due date of the payment.  An extension under this paragraph begins on the date the payment was due and continues for the period stated in a written notice to the lessee.

2. The commissioner may grant an extension in response to a request made within sixty days after the date of the default or failure notice provided in subsection A of this section.  An extension under this paragraph begins on the date of the notice and continues for the period stated in a written notice to the lessee.

3. If the department does not act on a request for extension within thirty days after receiving the request, the request is considered to be denied.

4. If the lessee fails during the period of the extension to complete all delinquent payments of rent, penalty and interest, the lease is subject to default and cancellation as provided by this section and section 37-289, except that if the last day of the last period of extension expires on the last day of the five-year period and all delinquent payments have not been paid by the last day of the five-year period, the lease is automatically canceled on the last day of the five-year period and shall be so noted on the records of the department.

5. If a payment of rent is made after the due date, payments must be made according to the extension granted by the commissioner under this subsection.

C. There shall be added to the delinquent rental a penalty and delinquent interest.  The rate of interest on delinquent rent shall be set by the state treasurer. The penalty shall be the greater of a minimum processing cost as determined by the commissioner or five per cent. The delinquent rent, penalty and interest shall be a lien on the improvements, crops and property on the land.

 

#### Section 37-288. Default on short-term lease; forfeiture and cancellation of lease; extension of time for payment; penalty and interest on delinquent rental; automatic termination for arrearage

A. If a lessee of a lease of ten years or less defaults in a payment of rent, as provided in the lease, or fails to comply with a condition, covenant or requirement of the lease, the lease and the lessee's rights under the lease are subject to forfeiture and cancellation as provided by this section and section 37-289.

B. If the lessee of a lease of ten years or less fails to pay the rent when due, the department may extend the time for payment an additional period not to exceed ninety days. The department shall not extend the period for payment of rental more than three times in one lease year and in no event for more than two hundred seventy days.

1. Notice of default shall be sent by certified mail to the lessee and to any parties who have registered with the department as mortgagees or other lienholders of the lessee's interest. The notice shall inform the lessee and registered mortgagees and lienholders of the specific nature of any default and their right to cure any curable default.

2. For leases of ten years or less, the lessee and registered mortgagees and lienholders have thirty days from receipt of notice of default in which to cure any default involving failure to pay rent, taxes or other assessments, and forty-five days from the receipt of notice to cure any other curable default.

3. For leases of more than ten years, the lessee and registered mortgagees and lienholders have sixty days from receipt of notice of default in which to cure any curable default.

4. As a condition of curing a default, the commissioner may require the lessee and registered mortgagees and lienholders to waive any right to cure future defaults of the same type. A waiver of the right to cure is valid only until the expiration of the current lease.

B. If the default is not cured within the applicable time period, the commissioner may make an order canceling the lease, and if it appears that the lease was procured through fraud, deceit or wilful misrepresentation, the improvements on the land shall be forfeited to the state.

#### Section 37-290. Cancellation of lease on reclassification of lands; preferred right to lease reclassified land; refund of advance rental payments

A. Upon reclassification of state lands, whether upon application for reclassification or upon initiation by the commissioner, notice of the decision shall be served upon all interested parties of record in the department.  If no appeal from the reclassification is taken as provided for by law, or if the decision of the commissioner is upheld on appeal, any lease upon the land reclassified shall be automatically cancelled on the issuance of a new lease or at the time of auction, whichever occurs first.

B. An applicant for renewal of a lease shall have a preferred right to lease the reclassified land at the reappraised rental thereof for a term not longer than ten years as determined by the department. The preferred right to lease does not extend to a lessee who has not substantially complied with the terms of the lease or who has not placed the land to the use prescribed in the lease during the term of the lease or within the time prescribed in the lease, except when that action was excused for good cause by written authorization by the department.

C. Upon cancellation of the lease of reclassified lands, if the land as reclassified is leased to a person other than the existing lessee or applicant for a renewal lease, the unused pro rata of an advance rental payment made by the existing lessee shall be refunded to such lessee, and the lessee shall be protected in improvements on the land owned by the lessee in the same manner as provided in section 37-322.01.

 

#### Section 37-291. Preferred rights to renewal of lease; exceptions; notification

B. The preferred right of renewal shall not extend to a lessee that has not substantially complied with the terms of the lease or that has not placed the land to the use prescribed in the lease during its term or within the time prescribed, unless for good cause the failure to perform was given written authorization by the department. If the department determines the continued leasing of the land is not in the best interest of the state trust, the lease shall not be renewed.

C. Not later than ninety days before the expiration of a lease, the department shall:

1. Notify the lessee by mail of the pending expiration and enclose an application for the lessee to renew the lease.

2. Send a copy of the notice to any parties that have registered with the department as mortgagees or other lienholders of the lessee's interest by certified mail, return receipt requested.

D. The department shall accept renewal applications by mail and may accept renewal applications electronically. The method by which the renewal application is submitted may not be a factor in the department's determination of whether to renew the lease.

E. If the existing lease is not renewed and the existing lessee is in substantial compliance with the terms of the lease and there is not a new lessee or buyer for the land within ninety days after the lease termination, the commissioner must sign an agreement to reimburse the former lessee for the improvements on the lands as provided by section 37-322.01.

#### Section 37-294. Recovery of lands unlawfully held

If it is determined that any person is unlawfully in possession of such lands, or is unlawfully claiming compensation for improvements, the department shall bring an action to recover possession of the lands and improvements, or otherwise establish the rights of the state.

#### Section 37-295. Disposition of long-term commercial lease prepayments; prepayment fund

A. If the department receives prepayments of rent paid from long-term commercial leases under any provision of this chapter, the monies received shall be transmitted to the state treasurer for investment in a prepayment fund for the appropriate beneficiary.  Any interest earned from the investments of monies in the prepayment fund shall be credited to the prepayment fund.  For each lease that is prepaid, the department shall give notice to the treasurer of the amount of rent annually due to the beneficiary according to a schedule maintained by the department.  The treasurer shall remit to the department an amount from the prepayment fund that is equal to the amount stated in the notice.  The department shall transfer the remittance to the credit of the fund of the appropriate beneficiary.

B. For leases entered into through December 31, 2000, the discount rate for prepayments made pursuant to subsection A shall be no greater than the current prevailing long-term interest rate established by the state treasurer on the date the lease is approved by the board of appeals.

C. For leases entered into from and after December 31, 2000, the discount rate for prepayments made pursuant to subsection A shall be no greater than the twenty-four month average yield for a fixed income security with a ten year maturity or average life which is eligible for purchase by the permanent fund managed by the state treasurer. The twenty-four month average calculation ends on the last day of the month before the month in which the board of appeals approves the lease.

### Article 4.1 - Protesting Auctions

#### Section 37-301. Procedure for protesting auctions

A. Any person who desires to protest any of the terms of a proposed auction for the sale of state land, the lease of state land, or the sale of natural products of state land shall file a written protest with the department within thirty days after the first day of publication of the terms of the proposed auction. All protests shall state specifically the term or terms of the auction to which objection is made and state specifically the reasons for each objection. An objection not specifically stated or timely made is deemed to be waived.

B. At his discretion, the commissioner, on ten days' notice, may order a hearing on any protest. Whether or not a hearing is held, the commissioner, not less than seven days before the auction date, shall enter a final order determining the validity of the protests. If the commissioner determines that a protest is correct, the pending auction shall be cancelled. If the commissioner determines that the grounds of protest are incorrect, the auction shall proceed at the time and place for which it was noticed.

C. Notwithstanding section 37-133, the commissioner's order granting or denying a protest is subject to review only through a special action to the court of appeals or supreme court, served on the department within twenty days after the commissioner's order is entered. Notwithstanding any law or rule applicable to other orders of the commissioner, no motion for rehearing is required before seeking review of an order of the commissioner rejecting a protest to the terms of an auction. Any rehearing motion shall be filed within ten days of the entry of the commissioner's order. Unless otherwise ordered by the commissioner, the filing of a motion for rehearing does not extend the time for seeking review of the commissioner's order granting or denying a protest. Unless the commissioner orders a rehearing within five days after the rehearing motion is filed, the rehearing motion is deemed denied. If a special action review is not sought within twenty days after the commissioner enters his order granting or denying a protest, or if the commissioner's order is sustained on special action review and the decision becomes final, no further action contesting the legality of the terms of the auction may be brought.

### Article 5 - Improvements on State Lands

#### Section 37-321. Permission required for person other than holder of certificate of purchase to make improvements; forfeiture for failure to obtain permission; report of improvements

A. Except as otherwise provided in section 37-323, if a lessee, a permittee or other person having a legal interest in state lands, other than a holder of a certificate of purchase, desires to construct or make improvements upon the lands, he shall first file with the department an application for permission to construct or make the improvements unless improvement authorization is contained within the terms of the lease. The application shall be allowed or rejected as the best interest of the state requires as determined by the department. Unless permission is granted by the department, the applicant shall not be entitled to reimbursement or compensation for improvements placed upon the state lands. Upon expiration or cancellation of the lessee's lease or permit, improvements placed on the land without approval shall be forfeited and become the property of the state.

B. The owner of improvements placed upon state lands by a lessee, a permittee or any other person having a legal interest in state lands shall prior to December 31, 1965, unless such time is extended by the department, report to the department in writing the description of the improvements, their location and the actual current cash value thereof. The improvements reported as provided by this subsection shall be allowed or rejected as the best interest of the state requires as determined by the department.

C. Improvements placed on state land granted to the territory of Arizona by the act of Congress approved January 27, 1894, or placed on land to which the state gains title by any determination, by a person who is not a lessee or permittee may be reported to the department after the person becomes a lessee or permittee. The improvements shall be allowed or rejected as the best interests of the state require, as determined by the department.

D. The department may, from time to time, but not more frequently than once a year, require from any lessee or permittee or the person having a legal interest in state lands information concerning the improvements. Failure to make the report shall, in the discretion of the department, subject the improvements to forfeiture to the state.

#### Section 37-321.01. Rights to water used on state land; definition

A. A permit or certificate for the right to use water on state land for stock watering or stockpond purposes, or for domestic use on a ranch or farm, shall be issued in the name of the state of Arizona except as follows:

1. If the place of use is located on state land, but the point of diversion is located on patented land, the certificate or permit shall be issued to the owner of the patented land.

2. If the place of use is located on state land, but the point of diversion is located on land owned by the United States, the permit or certificate shall be issued to the lessee of the state land.

3. If the water right was perfected under the law applicable at the time that the right was initiated by the lessee or its predecessors in interest for use on land that was owned by the United States before that land was designated for transfer to the state of Arizona, the certificate or permit shall be issued to the lessee of the state land.

B. The commissioner and the person or persons asserting that a permit or certificate should be issued as prescribed by this section may stipulate as to the ownership of a water right. The stipulation or agreement shall be accepted by the department of water resources.

C. An application for a certificate to appropriate water for use on state land as provided in subsection A of this section shall not be approved nor shall a permit or certificate be issued pursuant to this section by the director of the department of water resources, until the commissioner has been given the opportunity to review and object to the permit or certificate. Section 45-164, subsection C applies to any objections made pursuant to this subsection.

D. No person shall have any legal interest in or the right to lease state land based solely upon ownership of a water right acquired or confirmed under this section or section 45-257, subsection C.

E. No water right for stock watering or stockpond purposes, or for domestic uses on a ranch or farm that is acquired by a lessee pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section, may be severed from its place of use on state land and transferred for use on other land without prior written consent of the commissioner. The commissioner may withhold consent if the commissioner finds that the use of state land for grazing purposes is dependent upon the water right that is proposed to be transferred. A lessee's successor in interest or the state shall pay compensation to a lessee of state land who is entitled to a domestic, stock watering or stockpond water right pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 3 of this section, if the lessee is denied reasonable use of the water right because of a refusal by the commissioner to consent to the severance and transfer of the right from its place of use on state land. Compensation shall be determined by appraisal and may be reviewed by the state board of appeals by the procedure for appraising improvements on state land. On payment of the compensation, the department of water resources shall reissue the water right in the name of the person or entity making the payment.

F. For the purposes of this section, "certificate" includes certificates issued pursuant to title 45, chapter 1, article 5 or 10.

#### Section 37-322. Basis for appraisal of improvements; reimbursements; amortization; reimbursement for irrigation or district assessments and levies; limitation

A. Improvements placed on state lands prior to June 25, 1952 shall be appraised in accordance with the law in effect at the time the improvements were made. Improvements placed upon state lands after June 25, 1952, including water rights, when the owner thereof is entitled under law to reimbursement for the improvements, shall be appraised as follows:

1. Improvements, except eradication of noxious growth on grazing lands, and irrigation or other district assessments, shall be appraised at the time the appraisal is made on the following basis:

(a) The condition of the improvements.

(b) The current value.

(c) Their suitability for uses ordinarily made on the lands on which they are located at the time the improvements were made.

2. Reimbursement for the cost of eradication of noxious growth on grazing lands, shall be amortized at the rate of ten per cent per annum.

3. Reimbursement for irrigation or other district assessments and levies which have been legally assessed and levied against state lands, and the interest of the holders of such lands, whether under lease or permit, shall be limited to that portion of the assessments and levies which have been properly and legally assessed and levied to defray such district or project construction charges.

B. Pumps especially designed for the well in which placed shall be reimbursable improvements and shall be appraised as other reimbursable improvements.

C. The cost of improvements for clearing and leveling land for agricultural purposes shall remain as a credit for the lessee in case of sale of the land. Any reimbursement for the cost of clearing and leveling land used for agricultural purposes remaining unamortized on the effective date of this section shall not be amortized, but such unamortized balance shall remain as a credit for the lessee in case of sale of the land.

#### Section 37-322.01. Reimbursement for nonremovable improvements by succeeding lessee of lands not subject to auction; failure to pay; penalty

A. A lessee of state lands that are not subject to lease by auction shall be reimbursed by a succeeding lessee for improvements placed on the lands which are not removable.

B. If the retiring lessee and the new lessee do not agree upon the value of the improvements, or if there is no amortized value established for the improvements, either party may file with the state land department an application for appraisal of the improvements. If a lease is granted pursuant to section 37-284, a request for an appraisal shall be made more than ninety days before the expiration of the lease. Thereafter an appraisal of the improvements shall be made pursuant to section 37-322.  For agricultural and grazing leases, the appraiser shall consider the following in determining the value of the improvements:

1. The impact to surrounding state land.

2. Replacement cost minus physical and functional obsolescence as it relates to agriculture and grazing.

3. Any other factors that the commissioner determines to be relevant.

C. Upon making the appraisal, the department shall give notice of the amount by certified mail to each person interested in the appraisal. The notice shall require that the new lessee pay to the department for the prior lessee the entire amount of the appraisal before issuance of the lease unless all parties agree to an extended payment schedule. If the improvements were placed on state lands subject to a commercial lease and if the commissioner determines that the value of the improvements is so great that it inhibits the commissioner's ability to lease the property at fair market value, the commissioner may require reimbursement of the improvements pursuant to a payment schedule of not more than five years.

D. If the improvements are not paid for as agreed in an extended payment schedule, the succeeding lessee shall not be permitted to sell, assign or transfer his lease nor sell, assign or remove any improvements whatever from the land until the entire amount of the appraised value of the improvements has been paid.  Upon default the succeeding lessee shall be subject to the same penalties and liabilities as provided by section 37-288 for failure to pay rents, including a cancellation of the lease.

 

#### Section 37-322.02. Payment by purchaser or succeeding lessee for improvements on auctioned land

A. When state lands on which there are improvements for which the owner is entitled to be compensated are offered at an auction for sale or lease, and the purchaser or succeeding lessee is not the owner of the improvements, the purchaser or succeeding lessee shall pay the department at the time of the auction ten per cent of the appraised or remaining unamortized value of the improvements and the balance within thirty days thereafter. The department shall pay the owner of the improvements the payments collected.

B. If the department determines that the amount at which the improvements are appraised is so great that it hinders competitive bidding at an auction for the land, the department may sell the improvements on installments payable ten per cent upon announcement of the successful bidder, fifteen per cent thirty days thereafter and fifteen per cent annually thereafter for five years, together with six per cent interest on the balance remaining unpaid, which amount, until paid, shall be a lien upon the purchaser's or succeeding lessee's interest in the land.

C. The purchaser or succeeding lessee shall at all times keep the insurable improvements insured for the benefit of the owner of the improvements.

D. Payments shall be made at the time and in the manner prescribed for payments on the land or lease, and any default in the payments for improvements shall be deemed a forfeiture in the payments for the land or the lease and of all payments made.

#### Section 37-322.03. Improvements on state lands; taxation; disposition on termination of lease; statement of improvements

A. A lessee of state land shall maintain all improvements that are pertinent to the lease in serviceable condition for the term of the lease and shall not remove any improvement without written authorization from the department except as provided by subsection B.  All improvements placed upon state land shall, until they become the property of the state, be subject to assessment for taxes in the name of the owner, as other property.

B. Within sixty days before or ninety days following the expiration of a lease of state land, the lessee may remove from the land the lessee's removable improvements, if the removal will not injure the land.  Wells, embankments or dams designed for development, storage or conservation of water shall not be taken away, destroyed or injured, but shall remain as appurtenant to the land and shall be removed, destroyed or altered only by authority of the department.

C. The retiring lessee may, with written authority from the department, and within the time for removal, sell the lessee's improvements to the succeeding lessee.

D. At the commissioner's request, a lessee shall file with the department a sworn statement setting forth the character of the improvements and their actual cash value.

E. If an improvement remains on the land after ninety days after the lease termination, the department may remove, destroy or otherwise dispose of the improvement if the department reasonably determines that any of the following apply to the condition of the improvement:

1. The improvement must be repaired before it can be used for the purpose for which it was placed on the land, and the cost of repairs would equal or exceed the value of the repaired improvement.

2. The improvement must be repaired before it can be used for the purpose for which it was placed on the land and the value of the improvement before repair is equal to or less than the cost of disposing of the improvement.

3. The existence of the improvement in its current condition is unsafe, poses an unreasonable risk of injury to persons or property, violates an applicable provision of law or is a nuisance.

4. The improvement is not authorized by the department and is not in the best interest of the trust.

F. Before disposing of an improvement pursuant to subsection E of this section, the department shall send written notice to the former lessee, by certified mail, return receipt requested and addressed to the lessee’s last address of record with the department, that:

1. The department intends to remove, destroy or otherwise dispose of the improvement at any time beginning thirty days after the lessee’s receipt of the notice.

2. The department’s determination pursuant to subsection E of this section is appealable pursuant to section 37-215.

#### Section 37-322.04. Accounting for improvements which become property of state

When improvements on state lands become the property of the state, they shall be deemed to belong to the fund for the purpose of which the land was granted. Any monies subsequently received for the improvements shall be deposited in the fund in which the monies received from the sale or lease of the land are deposited. When any money has been paid from the general fund for the improvements such improvements shall not be deemed to belong to any special fund, and if the land is subsequently sold or leased, the purchaser or lessee shall reimburse the state for the improvements, and the amount paid from the general fund for the improvements shall be returned to that fund. Any surplus remaining after reimbursing the fund shall belong to the fund for the purpose for which the lands were granted.

#### Section 37-323. Permission required for construction on floodplains; criteria

A. A lessee, permittee or other person having a legal interest in state lands located in a floodplain as defined in section 48-3601 other than a holder of a certificate of purchase shall not construct or make improvements or any other development upon the lands without obtaining the written permission of the department.

B. The department may grant permission for any proposed construction, improvement or development under this section after consideration of the following:

1. The value of the construction, improvement or development to this state if this state were required to purchase it.

2. The effect the construction, improvement or development would have on other landowners or land occupiers.

3. Whether the proposed construction, improvement or development is in compliance with local floodplain regulations promulgated under title 48, chapter 21, article 1.

4. Whether the proposed construction, improvement or development is consistent with local floodplain management goals.

5. The requirements for lands held in trust by this state.

6. Possible construction, improvements or development as an alternative to that proposed.

7. Any other reasonable and relevant criteria determined by the department.

#### Section 37-324. Development or secondary plan; effect

Notwithstanding any other statute, a development or secondary plan prepared in the consideration of potential future uses for any state lands shall not be considered an improvement of any kind.

A. On the commissioner's initiative, the commissioner may designate certain urban lands as being under consideration for classification as urban lands suitable for urban planning, or suitable for conservation purposes if the lands are to be planned in conjunction with lands to be developed, pursuant to this section.  The commissioner may designate urban lands as being under consideration for classification as urban lands suitable for urban planning or conservation purposes upon application by the governing body having jurisdiction for the area in which the urban lands are located.

B. Unless the commissioner has asked the local governing body for a general or comprehensive plan amendment that would include public notification and hearing, and after designating lands pursuant to subsection A of this section, the commissioner shall give notice of intent to classify the lands as suitable for urban planning or conservation purposes and of intent to prepare a state general plan to existing lessees, local planning authorities, owners of property that extends to within three hundred feet of the designated urban lands and the beneficiary or beneficiaries for whom the lands are held in trust. Within thirty days after giving notice, the commissioner shall publish the notice stating the date, time and place of the public hearing for six publications in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the designated urban lands are located.  The commissioner shall give notice to any person who requests notice of any classification and preparation of a state general plan made under this section.

C. In the notice required under subsection B of this section, or on the commissioner's request of the local governing body for a general or comprehensive plan amendment, the commissioner shall notify all existing lessees of state land within the boundaries of the area under consideration that such a designation may subsequently result in reclassification of state lands within the boundaries of the designated areas.

D. If applicable, within sixty days after the last date of publication of notice under subsection B of this section, the commissioner or the commissioner's designee shall conduct a public hearing in the city, town or county in which the lands are located to receive and record oral and written testimony concerning the classification as urban lands suitable for urban planning or conservation purposes and the state general plan.

E. The commissioner may classify urban lands as urban lands suitable for urban planning or conservation purposes and may approve a state general plan after determining that:

1. The department has met the notice and public hearing requirements of subsections B, C and D of this section or that the commissioner has requested a general or comprehensive plan amendment by the local governing body that would include public notice and hearing.

2. The state lands being considered as urban lands suitable for urban planning are adjoining existing commercially or homesite developed lands which are either:

The commissioner shall state in writing the reasons for any determination that the classification or state general plan prepared according to this section would be detrimental to the interests of the trust.

G. After the commissioner approves the state general plan, no amendment or revision may be made without the commissioner's approval.  The commissioner may approve a proposed amendment or revision only after notifying and meeting with the local planning authority regarding the nature of the proposed amendment or revision.  If the local planning authority does not hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment or revision, the commissioner shall hold a public hearing on the proposed amendment or revision if the proposed amendment or revision does not substantially conform to the state general plan.  If such a hearing is held, the proposed amendment or revision may be adopted after the hearing and after the commissioner and the local planning authority consider the information presented at the hearing. The commissioner shall provide notice of the public hearing as provided by subsections B, C and D of this section. If neither the commissioner nor the local planning authority determines that a public hearing is necessary, the commissioner may adopt the proposed amendment or revision.

H. If the land included in a state general plan was previously sold or leased, and the plan amendment proposed by the owner or lessee would substantially increase the value of the land as estimated by an appraisal or would compete with land uses elsewhere on land included under the plan, then as a condition for approving the amendment, the commissioner may require additional consideration.

 

#### Section 37-334. Designation of lands; development or secondary plan; requirements; approval

A. The commissioner may designate certain urban lands as suitable for a development plan.  The designation may be made only for lands for which a state general plan has been approved under section 37-332, or a conceptual plan has been developed pursuant to section 37-331.03. The designation shall specify the boundaries of the urban lands and that a development plan is to be prepared for those lands.

B. After designating certain urban lands as suitable for a development plan, the commissioner may cause a development or secondary plan to be prepared.  The development or secondary plan may be submitted to the department, after a development planning permit or secondary planning permit is issued, or may be prepared by a planning contract to the lowest and best bidder, with monies appropriated by the legislature for the purpose of urban lands development planning.  A secondary planning permit is a planning permit issued for a parcel or parcels of state land that have not yet been disposed of to prepare a secondary plan which supplements and implements an approved development plan.

C. The development or secondary plan shall contain specific provisions for the use, development and management of the urban lands in accordance with the state general plan as approved under section 37-332.

D. The development or secondary plan shall contain provisions as are necessary to implement the purposes of this section, including:

1. Provisions for allocation and location of specific uses of the land, including residential, commercial, industrial, recreational or other appropriate uses.

2. Provisions for acceptable densities and concentrations of the designated land uses.

3. Provisions for the timing and rate of development.

4. Provisions for the delivery of an adequate or assured water supply as specified in title 45, chapter 1 or 2.

5. Provisions for public facilities and resources, including water supply delivery systems, wastewater collection and treatment systems, parks and public recreational facilities, school sites, roads and other elements of a transportation system and other necessary facilities and services.

6. Provisions for needed zoning and other land use control mechanisms.

7. Provisions for resource conservation and the use of alternate sources of energy.

8. Other provisions deemed relevant by the commissioner.

E. To the extent the proposed development plan would require zoning inconsistent with any existing zoning, the commissioner shall submit a request to the local government with jurisdiction over the lands in question for either rezoning consistent with the development plan or approval of a land use plan pursuant to statute or ordinance that would include designations of proposed zoning categories and land use intensity and that would be consistent with the development plan. The local government shall act upon the request within six months, notifying the commissioner as to the acceptance or rejection of the commissioner's request for rezoning or plan approval.  Rejection of a request for rezoning or plan approval may, at the commissioner's discretion, be appealed in the manner provided to any owner of land affected by a zoning decision.  The local government's zoning decision shall govern the use of the lands unless the commissioner determines that such zoning or plan is detrimental to the interests of the trust.  If the commissioner so determines, the commissioner shall prepare a written statement of the reasons for the determination and shall within ten days of such decision provide a copy of the written statement to the local planning authority.  The local government within whose jurisdiction the lands are located has thirty days from receipt of this statement to appeal the commissioner's decision to the board of appeals as provided for in section 37-215.  If the local government fails to act upon the commissioner's request for rezoning or plan approval within the time provided in this subsection, the commissioner may adopt the development plan, noting that the requested rezoning or plan approval has not been obtained from the local government. The commissioner may, after compliance with the requirements of section 37-335, reclassify the lands and proceed with their sale or lease, noting in the call for bids that the requested rezoning or plan approval has not been obtained.

F. The commissioner shall not approve the development or secondary plan until the director of water resources has either evaluated the plans for an adequate water supply for the proposed development of lands outside a groundwater active management area as required by section 45-108 or has certified that there is an assured water supply for the proposed development of lands in a groundwater active management area as required by section 45-576.

G. Following approval of the development plan by the commissioner, no amendment or revision may be made without approval by the commissioner.  The commissioner may approve a proposed amendment or revision of the development plan only if it is consistent with the state general plan or conceptual plan or after complying with the requirements prescribed under section 37-332, subsections E, F and G.

H. Following approval of a secondary plan by the commissioner, no amendment or revision may be made without the commissioner's approval. After notice to the development planning permittee, if one exists, and any master property association for the affected development plan, the commissioner may approve a proposed amendment of the secondary plan only if it is consistent with the development plan. If the proposed amendment is inconsistent with the development plan, the development plan must be amended under subsection G of this section.

I. If the land included in a development or secondary plan was previously sold or leased, and the plan amendment proposed by the owner or lessee would substantially increase the value of the land as estimated by an appraisal or would compete with land uses elsewhere on land included under the plan, then as a condition for approving the amendment, the commissioner may require additional consideration.

#### Section 37-334.01. Development plan for a master plan area

A. The commissioner may approve a development plan which includes a proposed master plan area if the proposed master plan area:

1. Is within the corporate boundaries of a city or town.

2. Has inadequate infrastructure to use state land for its highest and best use.

#### Section 37-335. Sale or lease of state lands for development

A. On approval of the development or secondary plan, the commissioner may reclassify the lands consistent with the plan. The existing lessee is entitled to compensation as provided by this chapter.

B. Upon the reclassification of state lands, the existing lessee shall be given notice of this reclassification and of the lessee's rights as provided in section 37-290, subsections A and C.

C. Upon the cancellation of a lease due to a reclassification of state lands under subsection A of this section, the existing lessee shall have a preferred right to lease the reclassified land by offering a bid that matches the highest and best bid received by the commissioner for the reclassified land at public auction.  The highest bidder may offer one subsequent bid that exceeds the bid of the existing lessee, but the existing lessee has the right to match the final bid.  If the existing lessee is not successful in obtaining the reclassified lease, or if the existing lessee chooses not to exercise the preferred right specified in this subsection, the existing lessee is eligible for compensation and reimbursement as provided in section 37-335.01.  The preferred right described in this section is subject to the requirements of section 37-291, subsection B, and the preferred right shall expire after the commissioner receives the highest and best bid at public auction.  If the commissioner determines that no bid will be accepted, the preferred right to lease the reclassified lease shall remain in effect, subject to any subsequent public auction.  The preferred right is not transferrable and can be exercised only by the existing lessee.

D. At least one independent appraisal is required for commercial leases that are offered at public auction if a former lessee has a vested preferred right under subsection C of this section. The commissioner shall require the successful bidder to pay the cost of the appraisal.

E. Following cancellation of a lease due to reclassification, the commissioner may issue an interim use permit for the urban lands reclassified for a term the commissioner deems necessary to protect the income of the trust and this state. For thirty days after cancellation of a lease, the prior lessee has a preferred right to obtain the interim use permit.

F. On determination by the board of appeals that the lands to be developed under this article should be sold, the commissioner shall comply with all publication and other statutory requirements for the sale of state lands.  In determining the minimum amount acceptable as a bid, the commissioner shall include the related proportionate part, based on the ratio of lands proposed to be sold to lands covered by the development or secondary plan, of the actual costs incurred by this state in obtaining the development or secondary plan adopted for implementation. All state costs recovered at the time of sale shall be paid to the state general fund.

G. The certificate of purchase or patent shall require the purchaser to honor any covenants and restrictions as deemed necessary by the commissioner to implement the approved development or secondary plan. A breach of any covenant or restriction results in the reversion of all rights, title and interests in the land to this state pursuant to the conditions prescribed by section 37-247.

H. If urban lands in the area of the adopted plan are sold, the purchaser shall conform the use of the land to the development or secondary plan and to other local zoning ordinances.

I. On a determination by the board of appeals that the land to be developed under this article should be leased, the commissioner shall incorporate the provisions of the approved development or secondary plan into the lease. The commissioner shall comply with all publication and other statutory requirements for the lease of state lands.

J. The successful bidder shall pay to this state the relative proportionate part, based on the ratio of lands proposed to be leased to lands covered by the development or secondary plan, of the actual costs incurred by this state in obtaining the development or secondary plan adopted for implementation.  Payment to this state shall be made at the time the lease is signed. All state costs recovered at the time of lease shall be paid to the state general fund.

K. The lessee shall submit to the jurisdiction of the county or the incorporated city or town within whose jurisdiction the land is located with respect to compliance with building, safety and housing codes or ordinances and any development or site plan review procedures applicable to the development of the land for the uses permitted by the lease.

L. A lease issued pursuant to this section may be terminated, at the option of the commissioner, for any violation of lease provisions pursuant to the conditions prescribed by section 37-288.  On cancellation or termination of a lease issued pursuant to this section, the commissioner may seek a new lessee only by complying with the same process through which the original lease was issued.  If the costs of the development or secondary plan have been received by the state as provided in subsection J of this section at the time of termination or cancellation, a subsequent lessee under this subsection need comply with subsection J of this section only to the extent that the lease offered to the subsequent lessee includes lands for which the proportionate part of the costs to the state for obtaining the development or secondary plan have not been recovered.

M. An encumbrance shall not be placed upon this state's interest in land leased for development. The lease may contain provisions that will permit the encumbering of the lessee's interest in the lease by mortgage or deed of trust.

N. Within the scope of an approved development or secondary plan, the commissioner may assess the value of rights-of-way or parcels to be used for parks, schools, public facilities, open space or other public purposes, and assign those values to parcels that will be sold or leased for residential, commercial or industrial purposes as payment for the purchase or lease price that otherwise would be required for such rights-of-way, or parcels to be used for parks, schools, public facilities, open space or other public purposes. The total revenues derived from all parcels within the development plan shall not be less than the aggregate appraised value of all the parcels.

#### Section 37-335.01. Compensation and reimbursement of lessee upon cancellation of lease

A. If an existing lease is cancelled due to reclassification under section 37-335, and if the existing lessee either did not utilize his preferred right to lease the reclassified land or was unsuccessful in obtaining the reclassified lease, the lessee is entitled to receive reimbursement for non-removable improvements as provided in section 37-322.01, and to receive reasonable compensation as provided in subsection B of this section for damages sustained by reason of the cancellation of the lease.

B. The commissioner shall determine the amount of reasonable compensation for damages sustained by the lessee after consideration of the following factors:

1. The time remaining in the term of the lease at the time that the lease is cancelled.

2. The actual use of the leased land.

3. The rentals paid during the term of the lease.

4. The actual amount of economic damage to the production unit caused by cancellation of the lease. In determining the amount of economic damage to the production unit, the commissioner shall not limit the scope of his review to only that portion of the lands involved in the reclassification for the purposes of urban lands development, but shall take into consideration the impact of the loss of these lands upon the overall production unit, including situations where other leased or private lands are necessary and have been leased by the existing lessee for operation as a production unit.

5. Other factors that the commissioner or the existing lessee determine to be relevant.

C. The commissioner's determination of reasonable compensation for damages under this section may be appealed as provided in section 37-214.

D. Payments for reimbursement or compensation or both as established in this section shall be made by the purchaser or lessee of the reclassified land to the lessee who had been the existing lessee at the time of sale or upon the signing of the lease for the reclassified land. This section shall not prevent the payment for reimbursement or compensation or both from being made in installments if this process is agreed to by the lessee who had been the existing lessee and the purchaser or subsequent lessee.

#### Section 37-335.02. Off-site improvement of urban lands

A. The governing body of an incorporated city or town or the board of directors of a county improvement district or a community facilities district pursuant to title 48, chapter 4, article 6 may submit to the commissioner for approval an improvement plan to be carried out by the city, town or district for some or all of the urban lands within its corporate or district boundaries.  The plan shall be submitted before any assessment has been levied for construction of off-site improvements which will be on or adjacent to and benefit the urban land. The plan may provide for the imposition of special assessments only against the leasehold interest of the lessee or the interest in the certificate of purchase of the purchaser of urban lands which will be subject to sale or long-term lease pursuant to section 37-281.02 or other law. The plan shall include the following:

1. A description of the work proposed.

2. An estimate of the cost of such work and the costs to be imposed against the leasehold interest of the lessee or the interest in the certificate of purchase of the purchaser of urban land within the area of the plan.

3. A map and legal description of the area showing the urban lands benefited by the work proposed.

4. A method of charging the cost to any long-term lessee or certificate of purchase holder of the urban lands benefited.

5. A schedule or alternative schedules for payment of the costs so charged by future holders of certificates of purchase or lease on such urban land, including the manner in which charges under such schedules will be held in abeyance for urban lands not subject to a certificate of purchase or lease.  The schedule for payments shall state the maximum assessment amount, excluding interest, which may be imposed against the leasehold interest of the lessee or the interest in the certificate of purchase of the purchaser of urban land involved in the plan.

6. The maximum interest rate to be charged on the unpaid charges, including the maximum rate at which interest, if any, will accrue for urban lands benefited but not subject to a certificate of purchase or lease.

7. Information showing that the urban land involved in the plan will be benefited in an amount equal to or greater than the proposed maximum assessment amount.

8. Such other terms as the governing body deems necessary or appropriate.

B. No plan may include urban land which is already subject to a long-term lease or certificate of purchase nor may any assessment be imposed against the leasehold interest of the lessee or the interest in the certificate of purchase of the purchaser of such land unless the lessee or certificate of purchase holder agrees to such inclusion and assessment.

C. The commissioner shall cooperate if requested by the governing body of the city, town or county improvement district in the preparation and revision of the improvement plan. The commissioner may hold such public hearings as the commissioner determines are necessary and may approve the plan if it is in compliance with the development or secondary plan for the urban lands affected.

D. If the commissioner approves the improvement plan or any modification of the plan, he shall enter an order to that effect in his official records and cause a copy to be served on the governing body requesting approval, recorded with the county recorder of the county in which the land is located and filed with the secretary of state. Fees shall not be charged for recording or filing.

 

#### Section 37-335.03. Assessment district assessments and city improvement plan assessments as lien on urban lands within district; enforcement

A. Officially certified descriptions of all urban lands included within the boundaries of a city special assessment or county improvement district subject to an approved improvement plan, with the amounts of assessments and charges of every character made against the leasehold interest of the lessee or the interest in the certificate of purchase of the purchaser of such lands, shall be furnished to the state land department as soon as the assessments or charges are levied. A promise by the lessee or purchaser to make timely payment of all assessment charges and an acknowledgment of the assessment shall be inserted in any certificate of purchase or lease for such lands.  If assessments have been levied against urban lands prior to purchase or lease pursuant to an improvement plan, the commissioner shall require that all unpaid installments on assessments be paid to the city or town or county improvement district before executing a lease or any instrument of sale.  Thereafter the proceedings leading to the recording of an assessment by the city or town or county improvement district may treat the lessee's or purchaser's interest in state land as land subject to an assessment notwithstanding section 48-582 or 48-920.

B. If any installment of any assessment or charge against the leasehold interest of the lessee or the interest in the certificate of purchase of the purchaser of urban land subject to an improvement plan is not paid when due, the superintendent of streets of the city or town or county improvement district where the urban land is located may, after not less than thirty days' notice to the named purchaser or lessee, notify the state land department of the nonpayment. Such nonpayment is a default under any certificate of purchase or long-term lease under which such lands are held. The interest of any purchaser or lessee of any urban lands within a municipal assessment district is subject to the enforcement and sale, redemption and forfeiture provisions of title 48, chapter 4, article 2 or title 48, chapter 6, article 1.  Nonpayment of charges due pursuant to an improvement plan subjects the certificate or lease to default proceedings as provided by this chapter.  If the delinquent amounts against such land are not paid within thirty days from the date the notice is received by the commissioner, the commissioner shall act to cancel the certificate of purchase or lease.

C. All charges and assessments legally imposed against the leasehold interest of the lessee or the interest in the certificate of purchase of the purchaser of urban lands subject to an improvement plan approved by the commissioner which are not held under a certificate of purchase or lease by the assessment district or pursuant to an improvement plan shall be a continuing charge, and such land shall not be leased or sold until the purchaser or lessee of the land presents to the state land department a certificate from the superintendent of streets of the city or town or county improvement district in which the land is located showing that all assessments due have been paid as provided in subsection A of this section.

#### Section 37-335.04. Liens not liabilities of state

This chapter shall not be construed as creating a lien against the interest of this state in any urban lands, nor an obligation against this state to pay charges or assessments imposed against urban land pursuant to an improvement plan. No action of any nature may be brought to forfeit, terminate or foreclose this state's title or interest in urban lands for failure of any lessee or purchaser to pay any assessment.

#### Section 37-335.06. Agreements to fund, install and reimburse costs of infrastructure on trust lands

A. The commissioner may enter into agreements with any public or private party to permit the construction, operation and maintenance of infrastructure on urban lands, including a community identity package for urban lands with a plan that is approved pursuant to this article. The agreement:

1. May provide for reimbursement by subsequent purchasers or lessees of actual infrastructure related land acquisition and construction costs plus a reasonable rate of interest as determined by the commissioner.

2. Shall contain such limitations as deemed necessary by the commissioner to protect the marketability of the affected trust land.

3. Shall identify the type, quality and location of infrastructure, the schedule for installation, the method of computing the reimbursable costs and the methods for repayment.

5. Shall state the procedure for amending the agreement.

6. Shall include rights and remedies for default under the agreement, including the right to cure.

B. A party to an agreement under this section may not delegate his obligations under the agreement without written approval of the commissioner. The commissioner may require performance and payment bonds or other sufficient security as a condition for his approval.

C. An agreement entered into under this section does not give rise to any preferred rights or other rights generally acquired by a lessee of state lands unless specifically stated in the agreement. Notwithstanding section 37-322.01 or 37-322.02 or any other statute, the right to reimbursement for infrastructure on urban lands is limited pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 of this section. The general provisions for default under state land leases or certificates of purchase do not apply to agreements under subsection A of this section.

#### Section 37-336. Rules; review and approval by legislature; duties of commissioner

A. The commissioner may adopt rules pursuant to title 41, chapter 6 to carry out this article. All rules adopted by the commissioner are subject to review and approval by the legislature.

B. Following the adoption of a rule, the commissioner shall immediately forward a certified copy to the speaker of the house of representatives and the president of the senate. The legislature may review and, by concurrent resolution, approve, disapprove or modify any rule submitted by the commissioner for review and approval. Each rule adopted by the commissioner as provided by law is effective pending legislative review. If a concurrent resolution is not passed by the legislature with respect to the rule within one year following receipt of a certified copy, the rule is deemed to have been approved by the legislature.

C. On disapproval by the legislature of a rule, the commissioner shall immediately discontinue the use of any procedure, action or proceeding authorized or required by the disapproved rule. On modification by the legislature of a rule, the commissioner shall immediately suspend the use of any procedure, action or proceeding authorized or required by the original rule until a modified rule has been adopted in accordance with title 41, chapter 6. Following the adoption of the modified rule, the commissioner shall conduct all subsequent proceedings in accordance with the modified version of the rule.

B. The commissioner may retain one or more independent experts to assist in assessing the qualifications of any applicant and consultants or in evaluating the benefits of any proposed development concept. The commissioner shall select any such independent experts and may require each applicant to pay the fees, costs and hiring expenses incurred in analyzing the applicant's qualifications and proposal. If the applicant is unwilling to pay such fees, costs and expenses, the applicant shall notify the commissioner in writing before the fees, costs and expenses are actually incurred, and the applicant's application shall be automatically withdrawn from consideration. The commissioner shall deposit, pursuant to sections 35-146 and 35-147, monies received under this subsection in the state general fund.

C. The commissioner may deny the applications or select the best applicant, considering each consultant's or applicant's experience and expertise, the cost to complete the development planning under the permit or secondary permit and the best interest of the trust.

D. Compensation for planning may be allowed as follows:

1. The commissioner may allow compensation for planning if all of the following conditions apply:

The inclusion of any highway, road, street or route in the state, county or municipal system shall be solely in accordance with other law.

G. This section does not:

1. Apply to any Revised Statute 2477 right-of-way across private property.

2. Impair, modify or otherwise affect any private property rights in effect on July 3, 2015.  Any claim, determination or identification of a right-of-way across public lands pursuant to this section does not establish prior rights for determining financial or legal responsibility for taking any private property rights, in whole or in part.  All presumptions and interpretations of fact and law relating to a claim, determination or identification of a right-of-way across public lands pursuant to this section shall be in favor of preserving private property rights.

3. In a separate, subsequent proceeding pursuant to section 37-1128, subsection B, consider evidence of public trust values and then identify and make a public report of any public trust values that are now associated with the navigable watercourses.

B. Before receiving, reviewing or considering any evidence pursuant to subsection A of this section for a particular watercourse, the commission shall publish notice once each week for three consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which the watercourse is located.  The notice shall include:

1. A statement of the intent to receive, review and consider evidence.

2. An address to which interested parties may submit evidence for the commission's review.

3. A date by which evidence must be submitted.

4. A general description of the procedures the commission will use to review the evidence.

C. Private citizens, clubs, organizations, corporations, partnerships, unincorporated associations, municipal corporations and public entities may present evidence to the commission at a hearing according to commission rules. The submission of evidence by any party pursuant to the commission's notice under subsection B of this section does not preclude that party from submitting additional evidence at any hearing before the commission.

D. The state land department shall consult and coordinate its efforts to gather evidence of navigability and public trust values with the department of water resources, the game and fish department, the state parks board and other interested persons and public and private entities.  The commission shall consider the information that those persons and entities have compiled regarding the navigability of watercourses.

E. After public notice, the commission shall set priorities for investigating and conduct hearings on the navigability of the watercourses in this state. In setting the priorities, the commission shall consider:

1. The number and value of parcels of real property that are affected by a state claim of sovereign ownership to the bed of the watercourse.

2. The degree of hardship to private parties and political subdivisions due to title uncertainties relating to the bed of the watercourse.

3. The significance of the public trust values associated with the watercourse and the degree to which those values are threatened.

4. The potential viability of this state's sovereign claims to the watercourse, giving higher priority consideration to more viable claims.

F. A person who is aggrieved by the undetermined navigability status of a watercourse may petition the commission to modify the priority set under subsection E of this section and grant expedited consideration for a particular watercourse. The commission shall grant the petition if justified by the factors listed in subsection E of this section.

G. No judicial action seeking a determination of navigability of a watercourse, to establish or obtain ownership of land within the bed and banks of a watercourse or to determine any public trust values associated with a watercourse may be commenced, continued or completed unless the commission has made a final determination with respect to the watercourse pursuant to section 37-1128. This subsection does not preclude the department from seeking a temporary restraining order or injunctive relief at any time to prevent loss or damage to public trust resources.

H. Notwithstanding subsection G of this section, any condemnation action by this state or a political subdivision of this state may proceed to trial and conclusion, including the payment of compensation, regardless of the potential claim of title by this state based on the navigability of the watercourse.  In any action commenced or continued pursuant to this subsection, the court shall not consider or decide the navigability of the watercourse.  Any judgment in any action commenced or continued pursuant to this subsection shall be subject to a potential claim of title by this state based on the navigability of the watercourse.

#### Section 37-1124. Compiling evidence and records by department

A. Beginning on or about the date that the commission establishes priorities pursuant to section 37-1123, subsection E, but in no event later than January 2, 1993, the department shall begin the necessary investigation and inquiries to assemble the evidence relevant to finding navigability with respect to those watercourses given the highest priority by the commission. The department shall continue the investigations and inquiries as resources permit, in the order of priority set by the commission.

B. After collecting and documenting all reasonably available evidence regarding the condition and usage of a watercourse as of February 14, 1912, the present uses of the underlying land and the public trust values associated with the watercourse, if any, the department shall promptly transmit all of the evidence to the commission.

C. The department shall maintain a permanent record of the material assembled and transmitted to the commission.

#### Section 37-1126. Hearings; notice

A. The commission shall schedule public hearings to receive additional evidence and testimony relating to navigability or nonnavigability of each watercourse, and, if the commission finds a watercourse is navigable, the commission shall schedule public hearings to identify and make a public report of any public trust values associated with the watercourse.  The hearings shall be held at the commission's office or, in the case of a hearing concerning a watercourse located principally outside of Maricopa county, at the county seat of the county in which the predominant portion of the particular watercourse is located. The commission may schedule additional hearings at other locations at the commission's discretion.

B. At least thirty days before any public hearing under this section, the commission shall cause notice of the hearing to be published in two newspapers, one of statewide circulation and another of general circulation in the county where the hearing is to be held. In addition, the commission shall mail notice of the hearing to any person who has previously requested notice of hearings in writing from the commission.

#### Section 37-1128. Determination of navigability

A. After the commission completes the public hearing with respect to a watercourse, the commission shall again review all available evidence and render its determination as to whether the particular watercourse was navigable as of February 14, 1912.  If the preponderance of the evidence establishes that the watercourse was navigable, the commission shall issue its determination confirming that the watercourse was navigable.  If the preponderance of the evidence fails to establish that the watercourse was navigable, the commission shall issue its determination confirming that the watercourse was nonnavigable.

B. With respect to those watercourses that the commission determines were navigable, the commission shall, in a separate, subsequent proceeding, identify and make a public report of any public trust values associated with the navigable watercourse.

C. The commission shall make its determinations under subsections A and B of this section in writing with sufficient documentation and detail to confirm the rationale and basis for the determination.  The determinations constitute final administrative determinations and are not subject to title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

D. The commission shall immediately notify the department of any watercourse that it determines to be navigable or nonnavigable under subsection A of this section.  Within one hundred eighty days after receiving notice that a watercourse is:

1. Navigable, the department shall send notice of that determination to each record owner of, and each person or entity that has an interest of record in, any property that may be affected by the determination and to each person or entity that has requested notification of any determination of navigability.  The department shall include a statement of whether the department intends to seek judicial review of the commission’s determination. Any time after the date of the notice under this paragraph, the record title owner or lessee of any affected property may petition the department in writing to disclaim, release, relinquish or dispose of the property from public trust land status as no longer necessary or materially useful for the purposes of the trust.

2. Nonnavigable, the department shall send notice of that determination to each person or entity that has requested notification of any determination of nonnavigability.  The department shall include a statement of whether the department intends to seek judicial review of the commission’s determination.

E. After the time for judicial review of the commission's determination with respect to any watercourse has expired, as provided in section 37-1129, the commission shall cause a record of its determination to be recorded in the office of the county recorder of each county in which any part of the watercourse affected by the determination is located.

#### Section 37-1129. Judicial review

A. Beginning on the date the commission issues a determination under section 37-1128, subsection A and continuing through ninety days after the department issues a notice under either section 37-1128, subsection D, paragraph 1 or 2, the state land commissioner or any person who is aggrieved by the commission’s determination may seek judicial review in superior court in the county in which all or part of the watercourse that is directly affected by the determination is located.

B.&#8194;&#8194;Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, judicial review shall be conducted pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

C.&#8194;&#8194;If separate actions are filed under this section with respect to the same watercourse or adjacent or proximate watercourses, on motion by any party to any such action or on its own initiative, the court may:

1.&#8194;&#8194;Order a joint hearing or trial of any matter in the actions.

2.&#8194;&#8194;Order all of the actions pending in any court to be consolidated.

3.&#8194;&#8194;Issue such orders concerning proceedings in the actions as may tend to avoid unnecessary costs or delay or as may be necessary to avoid inconsistent results.

 

#### Section 37-1130. Title to bed of nonnavigable watercourse; appropriation of waters for public trust values

A. Subject to judicial review under section 37-1129, the commission’s determination that a watercourse is nonnavigable constitutes a waiver, relinquishment and disclaimer of this state's right, title or interest in the bed of the watercourse based on its navigability.

B. This state may obtain any water that is necessary to maintain and protect public trust values that are identified by the commission pursuant to section 37-1128, subsection B only by complying with the requirements of title 45.

#### Section 37-1131. Notice to landowners; quiet title action

A. If the commission determines a watercourse to be navigable as provided in section 37-1128, the state land department shall do the following before it files any quiet title action regarding public trust property beneath or adjacent to the watercourse:

1. Collect information and perform land surveys that are necessary to determine the boundaries of the bed of the watercourse. The bed of the watercourse to which the state claim applies is the bed of the watercourse existing on the date of the commission's determination, unless the preponderance of the evidence establishes a different location.  Before making this determination, the department shall provide public notice and any opportunity for comment by the public.

2. Compile a complete description of each parcel of land lying wholly or partially in the bed of the watercourse, including record title ownership by any person, and a complete title search of each parcel to show how and when the lands were first conveyed in apparent violation of the public trust.

3. If the land was conveyed in apparent violation of the public trust by an agency of the United States, bring an action against the United States for damages and prosecute the action to final judgment. Any damages collected shall be placed in the riparian trust fund established by section 37-1156.

B. At least thirty days before entering onto any lands in or adjacent to the bed of a watercourse as required for purposes of this section, the department shall notify any record title owner of the property by certified mail of the intention to inspect the property.  The notice shall:

1. State the period during which the department or the department's consultant intends to inspect the property and that the inspection is required under subsection A of this section.

2. Describe the activities that the department or the department's consultant intends to perform on the property.

C. Within thirty days after compiling the parcel information pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 2 of this section the department shall notify each record owner or lessee of property that is located in the bed of the navigable watercourse and each person and entity that have an interest of record in the property of the commission's determination and that, by virtue of the determination, all or a portion of the property will be claimed as public trust land of this state in a quiet title action.  The notice shall include:

1. The name of the watercourse and the date of the determination of navigability pursuant to section 37-1128.

2. The legal description and acreage of the parcels that the department has determined to be in the bed of the watercourse.

3. A statement that record title owners, lessees and parties having an interest of record in the parcels have a right to appeal the department's determination of the parcel boundaries within thirty days after receiving the notice as provided by title 41, chapter 6, article 10.

D. The department shall not commence an action to quiet title to land under this article until the commission has issued a final determination regarding the navigability of the watercourse pursuant to section 37-1128 and that determination is subject to no further judicial review pursuant to section 37-1129.

E.&#8194;&#8194;Venue for any action to quiet title under this section is proper only in the superior court in the county in which the affected lands are located, but the court may grant or deny requests for change of venue pursuant to title 12, chapter 4, article 1.

F.&#8194;&#8194;The department shall join as parties to any action to quiet title under this section each record owner of, and each person or entity that has an interest of record in, any property in the county that may be affected by this state's claim to ownership of the bed of the affected watercourse, but this requirement does not constitute grounds for dismissing the action if the persons or entities not joined are not subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state.

 

#### Section 37-1132. Refunds to record title owners

A. If this state's ownership of a parcel or portion of a parcel of property is confirmed in a quiet title action under this article, the state treasurer shall pay to the record title owner an amount from the state general fund to:

1. Refund all property taxes ever paid on the property.

2. Compensate the person for all improvements to the property.

3. Refund the purchase price paid for the property, plus interest at the legal rate, if the property was purchased from this state by the person or any predecessor in title.

B. The department of administration, in coordination with the department of revenue and the state land department, shall certify to the state treasurer the amounts due to the record title owner pursuant to this section.

### Article 3 - Management of Public Trust Lands

#### Section 37-1151. Petition to release public trust status

A. In responding to a petition filed by a record title owner or lessee pursuant to section 37-1128, subsection D, paragraph 1 the department shall consider the extent to which the property that has been confirmed to the state's ownership in a quiet title action, either because of its nature or because of changes, is no longer of material use for protecting public trust values. If the department concludes that the property is not of material use for protecting public trust values, the department shall consider the extent to which a release of the trust is appropriate in light of the public benefit to be derived from alternate uses, and the equitable interests or hardships of the record title holder or lessee, including each of the following:

1. The year in which the property was acquired by the record owner or lessee.

2. The entity or person from whom the property was acquired by the record owner or lessee.

3. The manner in which the record owner or lessee acquired the property.

4. The purchase price or lease terms paid by the record owner or lessee.

5. The amount of property taxes paid each year since the record owner or lessee acquired the property.

6. The profit or benefit derived from the property by the record owner.

7. The extent to which the record owner on the date of acquisition knew or should have known that the property was potentially trust land.

8. All improvements made to the property since the record owner or lessee acquired the property.

9. The public trust values identified by the commission pursuant to section 37-1128, subsection B.

10. Whether any improvements on the property impair, obstruct, promote or destroy the value of the watercourse for public trust values.

11. The existing uses of the property, its reasonable highest and best use and whether such uses impair, obstruct, promote or destroy the value of the watercourse for public trust values.

12. Whether the physical condition of the watercourse has materially changed since February 14, 1912 adversely affecting the watercourse's capability of being navigated, including changes due to construction of dams, reservoirs, dikes, levees, canals and ditches that were constructed for water conservation or flood control purposes by public entities, municipal corporations or the United States.

13. Any diminution in value to the record owner's or lessee's contiguous property caused by this state's ownership.

14. The degree of effect of continuation of the current use or any proposed change in use of the property on public trust values.

15. The impact of continuation of the current use or any proposed change in use of the property on the public trust values.

16. The impact of continuation of the current use or any proposed change in use of the property when examined cumulatively in conjunction with existing authorized impediments to full use of the public trust values.

17. The impact of continuation of the current use or any proposed change in use of the property on the public trust values if those values are considered with respect to the primary purpose to which the property is now suited.

18. The degree to which continuation of the current use or any proposed change in use requires that broad public uses be set aside in favor of more limited and private uses.

B. At least thirty days before issuing a decision that land may be released from the public trust under this section the department shall provide written notice of the proposed action and an opportunity to comment to any person who has previously requested written notice of actions under this section. The department shall provide contemporaneous written notice of the final decision to any person who filed a comment.

#### Section 37-1152. Auction and sale of released public trust lands

A. If the department determines that any portion or reach of a bed of a navigable watercourse may be released from the public trust, the department shall cause an appraisal of the property to be made to determine its fair market value. The property shall not be disposed of for an amount less than that appraised value.

B. At the same time, the department shall also cause an appraisal to be made of such reasonable improvements to the property as the record owner or lessee may have made in good faith. The amount of that appraised value of the improvements shall be credited and applied to the bid of the record owner or lessee at any sale or public auction of the land that the department conducts. If the record owner or lessee is not the successful bidder at the sale or auction, the successful bidder shall reimburse the owner or lessee by the amount of the appraised value of the improvements.

C. Sections 37-236, 37-237 and 37-238 apply to the sale of such lands at public auction.

#### Section 37-1153. Permit to use public trust lands

A. On application, the department may permit the use of public trust lands by a public entity or private person or entity if the department determines that such use will be consistent with, and in the best interests of, the public trust. The use may continue only as long as the lands are used for the purposes for which the permit is granted. The permit shall contain terms and conditions that are necessary or appropriate to assure protection of the public trust interests associated with the lands. The user shall pay due compensation to the department that shall be used for the purposes prescribed by this chapter.

B. At least thirty days before issuing a permit under this section the department shall provide written notice of the proposed action and an opportunity to comment to any person who has previously requested written notice of actions under this section.

#### Section 37-1154. Public improvements in beds of navigable watercourses; definition

A. A determination that a watercourse is navigable does not affect the right of a public entity to own, operate, maintain or repair a public improvement reasonably constructed in the bed of the watercourse under the public entity's powers if the improvement was constructed before the determination that the watercourse is navigable and does not materially impair the public trust. The public entity is considered to have obtained this state's consent to construct the public improvement and is not liable to pay compensation to this state for the land on which the public improvement is constructed if the improvement does not materially impair, obstruct or destroy the function of the watercourse for public trust purposes.

B. If the commissioner determines that the public improvement described in subsection A of this section does not, or will not if appropriate conditions are followed, materially impair the public trust uses, the department may require the public entity to obtain a permit for the improvement pursuant to section 37-1153 but shall not assess any fee for issuing the permit.

C. At least thirty days before issuing a decision under subsection D or E of this section the department shall provide written notice of the proposed action and an opportunity to comment to any person who has previously requested notice of actions under this section. The department shall provide contemporaneous written notice of the final decision to any person who filed a comment.

D. If the commissioner determines that the public improvement described in subsection A of this section destroys the function of the watercourse for public trust purposes and is not in furtherance of the public trust status of the land, the public entity may petition the department for release of public trust status pursuant to section 37-1151. In evaluating the petition, the department shall consider, in addition to the factors prescribed by section 37-1151, whether constructing the public improvement was undertaken pursuant to the public entity's authority and whether the public improvement continues to serve a public purpose.

E. If the commissioner determines that a release is appropriate under subsection D of this section, the public entity may purchase this state's interest in the land without a public auction by paying an amount to be determined by the department pursuant to section 37-1152 directly to this state pursuant to section 9-401, subsection A, section 11-251, paragraph 45 or section 48-3603, subsection C, paragraph 2, as applicable.  No cause of action or claim for reimbursement accrues for the benefit of any public entity that exercises its right to purchase this state's interest pursuant to this subsection.

F. For purposes of this section, "public improvement" includes any facility established, constructed or maintained by a public entity pursuant to law and those works described in section 37-1101, paragraph 4.

#### Section 37-1155. Prior use of public trust lands

This state shall not claim compensation for any good faith use of public trust lands made before September 10, 1991 by the record owner or the record owner's lessee if all of the following conditions apply:

1. The landowner had record title to the land at the time of the use.

2. At the time of use, the record landowner did not have actual knowledge, nor did any recorded instrument disclose, that the state had a sovereign claim to the land.

3. The record landowner used the land in a reasonable manner.

#### Section 37-1156. Riparian trust fund; acquisition and management of riparian lands

A. The riparian trust fund is established consisting of monies received from the sale or use of sovereign streambed lands and resources under this chapter, damages collected from the United States pursuant to section 37-1131 and any other appropriations, gifts, grants or donations designated by the donor for that purpose. The state shall maintain the fund separate and apart from all other funds. On notice from the commissioner the state treasurer shall invest and divest monies in the riparian trust fund as provided by section 35-313, and monies earned from investment shall be credited to the riparian trust fund.

B. The state land commissioner shall use the income, other proceeds and not more than seventy-five per cent of any added principal of the fund in a fiscal year pursuant to this section:

1. To acquire, from willing sellers, land or interests in land located in riparian areas in this state for public purposes consistent with conservation of wildlife and recreation.

2. For such other expenditures as promote the purposes of the public trust.

C. The state land commissioner shall consult with and receive advice from the Arizona state parks board and the Arizona game and fish department regarding the acquisition and management of land and interests in land under this section.
