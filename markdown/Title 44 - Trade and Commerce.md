C. As to each transfer of equity by a buyer or subsequent transferee, the holder of the contract shall be entitled to a transfer of equity fee not in excess of fifteen dollars. If the contract so provides, at the option of the holder, no such transfer of equity shall be valid against the holder without the written consent of the holder. No certificate of title shall be issued by the state of Arizona in the name of such transferee unless written consent of the holder accompanies the application for transfer of title.

D. No retail installment contract shall be signed by any party thereto when it contains blank spaces to be filled in after it has been signed except that, if delivery of the motor vehicle is not made at the time of the execution of the contract, the identifying numbers or marks of the motor vehicle or similar information and the due date of the first installment may be inserted in the contract after its execution. The buyer's written acknowledgment, conforming to the requirements of subsection B of section 44-286, of delivery of a copy of a contract shall be conclusive proof of such delivery, that the contract when signed, did not contain any blank spaces except as herein provided, and of compliance with this article in any action or proceeding by or against the holder of the contract.

 

#### Section 44-290. Amount of payments; waiver of remedies

A. Upon written request from the buyer, the holder of a retail installment contract shall give or forward to the buyer a written statement of the dates and amounts of payments and the total amount unpaid under such contract. A buyer shall be given a written receipt for any payment when made in cash.

B. No provision in a retail installment contract relieving the seller from liability for any legal remedies which the buyer may have against the seller under the contract, or any separate instrument executed in connection therewith, shall be enforceable.

#### Section 44-291. Computation of interest; prepayment rebate; additional charges; secondary motor vehicle finance transaction; definitions

A. Except as provided in subsections G and H of this section, under a retail installment contract it is lawful to charge and receive interest not to exceed the maximum rate set by contract.

B. The finance charge may be computed either at a single annual percentage rate using the actuarial method or it may be precomputed on the assumption that all payments will be made in the amount and on the dates scheduled. If the finance charge is precomputed, the fact that payments are made either before or after the date due does not affect the amount of finance charge which the seller or holder may charge or receive. If the precomputed contract balance is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, refinancing or otherwise, the seller or holder shall charge only for the finance charge which has been earned and unpaid late payment or delinquency charges as of the date of prepayment, and the buyer shall receive a rebate of that portion of the precomputed finance charge which is the difference between the total precomputed finance charges and the charges at the contract finance charge computed on the unpaid principal balance based on the number of days or months to maturity based on either a thirty day month - three hundred sixty day year or daily three hundred sixty-five or three hundred sixty-six day year on the number of days remaining to final maturity, except that the number of days shall be the same as that used in calculating the finance charge as prescribed in subsection C of this section. The amount of such rebate shall not be computed pursuant to the method commonly known as the "rule of 78's". To simplify the calculation of earned finance charge, it is permissible to assume that all payments were made as originally scheduled or as otherwise mutually agreed.

C. It is permissible to calculate a finance charge on an annual basis of twelve months of thirty days each, or on a daily basis if a day is counted as 1/360th, 1/365th, or 1/366th of a year, as the buyer and seller or holder may agree by writing. The seller or holder may also charge a late payment or delinquency charge, in addition to all finance charges permitted, on each installment not paid in full on the tenth day after its due date in an amount not to exceed five per cent of the unpaid balance of the installment.

D. In addition to the cash sale price of the vehicle, the seller may charge for any insurance premiums incurred in connection with the retail installment transaction.

E. Notwithstanding the late payment or delinquency charge provided in subsection C of this section, in a commercial transaction, the seller or holder may charge a late payment or delinquency charge, in addition to all finance charges permitted, on each installment not paid in full on the tenth day after its due date in an amount of not more than five per cent of the unpaid balance of the installment.

F. Any sales finance company may purchase or acquire or agree to purchase or acquire from any seller any contract on such terms and conditions as may be agreed on between them. Filing of the assignment notice to the buyer of the assignment and any requirement that the holder maintain dominion over the payments or the motor vehicle if repossessed is not necessary to the validity of a written assignment of a contract as against creditors, subsequent purchasers, pledgees, mortgagees and lien claimants of the seller. Unless the buyer has notice of the assignment of his contract, payment under the contract made by the buyer to the last known holder of such contract is binding on all subsequent holders.

G. If the retail installment contract is a secondary motor vehicle finance transaction, the seller, bailor, lender or lessor shall determine the annual secondary motor vehicle finance rate and all charges relating to the sale, conditional sale, bailment or lease and repurchase of the vehicle.  The seller, bailor, lender or lessor shall calculate the annual secondary motor vehicle finance rate by multiplying the monthly secondary motor vehicle finance rate by twelve.  A retail installment contract that is a secondary motor vehicle finance transaction is subject to the following maximum finance rates on a secondary motor vehicle finance contract in the original principal amount of:

1. Five hundred dollars or less, a monthly finance rate of seventeen per cent.

2. More than five hundred dollars but not more than two thousand five hundred dollars, a monthly finance rate of fifteen per cent.

3. More than two thousand five hundred dollars but not more than five thousand dollars, a monthly finance rate of thirteen per cent.

4. More than five thousand dollars, a monthly finance rate of ten per cent.

H. Except as the result of an accidental or bona fide error, if the licensee charges, contracts for or receives any amount in excess of the finance charges and other fees expressly permitted by this chapter, the secondary motor vehicle transaction is voidable and the licensee has no right to collect or receive any principal, finance charges or other fees in connection with that secondary motor vehicle finance transaction.  Any secondary motor vehicle finance transaction that is made by a person who is required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter but who is not licensed is void, and the person has no right to collect, receive or retain any principal, finance charges or other fees in connection with that secondary motor vehicle finance transaction.

I. Section 44-287, subsection B does not apply to a secondary motor vehicle finance transaction if the contract complies with the disclosure requirements prescribed in federal law.  The seller shall conspicuously disclose in the contract the annual secondary motor vehicle finance rate.

J. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Actuarial method" means the method of allocating payments made on a debt between the unpaid principal balance and the finance charge pursuant to which a payment is applied first to the finance charge due and any remainder is subtracted from the unpaid principal balance.

2. "Commercial transaction" means a transaction in which the motor vehicle is intended by the borrower for use primarily for other than personal, family or household purposes.

 

#### Section 44-293. Motor vehicle; refinancing retail installment contract

A. The holder of a contract, upon request by the buyer, may extend the scheduled due date of all or any part of any installment or installments, defer payment or payments, renew or restate the unpaid time balance of such contract, the amount of the installments and the time schedule therefor and may collect for such extension, deferment, renewal or restatement a refinance charge computed at the discretion of the holder as provided in subsection B of this section.

B. If the unpaid time balance of the contract is extended, deferred, renewed or restated, the holder may compute the refinance charge on such amount by adding to the unpaid balance the cost for insurance and other benefits incidental to the refinancing plus any accrued delinquency and collection charges, and deducting any refund which may be due the buyer by prepayment pursuant to section 44-291, for unearned finance charges specified by the contract and by reclassifying the motor vehicle by its then year model, for the term of the refinancing agreement, but otherwise subject to the provisions of this article governing computation of the original finance charge. The provisions of this article governing the minimum finance charge under the refund schedule shall apply in calculating refinance charges on the contract renewed under this method of computation.

#### Section 44-294. Records

Every holder or sales finance company shall maintain in its office, for a period of not less than one year after date of final payment or entry therein, a copy of all retail installment contracts or retail installment transactions entered into under the terms of this chapter.

#### Section 44-295. Penalties

Any person wilfully violating any provision of this chapter relating to the provisions of a contract shall not receive or retain any finance, delinquency or collection charge on the contract.

A communication with an owner by a person other than the holder or the holder's representative who has not identified the property in writing to the owner is not an indication of interest in the property by the owner.

D. An indication of an owner's interest in property includes:

1.

3. The making of a deposit to or withdrawal from a bank account.

4.

E. Property is payable or distributable notwithstanding the owner's failure to make demand or present an instrument or document otherwise required to obtain payment.

#### Section 44-306. Burden of proof as to property evidenced by record of check or draft

A record of the issuance of a check, draft or similar instrument is prima facie evidence of an obligation.  In claiming property from a holder who is also the issuer, the department's burden of proof as to the existence and amount of the property and its abandonment is satisfied by showing issuance of the instrument and passage of the requisite period of abandonment.  Defenses of payment, satisfaction, discharge and want of consideration are affirmative defenses and are the burden of the holder to establish.

G. If the laws of this state or the terms of the life insurance policy require the insurance company to give notice to the insured or owner that any automatic premium loan provision or other nonforfeiture provision has been exercised and the notice given to an insured or owner whose last known address according to the company's records is in this state is undeliverable, the company shall make a reasonable search to ascertain the policyholder's correct address to which the notice must be mailed.

B. A holder who has paid money to the department pursuant to this chapter may subsequently make payment to a person who reasonably appears to the holder to be entitled to payment.  On a filing by the holder of proof of payment and proof that the payee was entitled to the payment, the department  shall promptly reimburse the holder for the payment without imposing any fee or other charge.  If the holder seeks reimbursement for a payment made on a negotiable instrument, including a traveler's check or money order, the department shall reimburse the holder if the holder files proof that the instrument was duly presented and that payment was made to a person who reasonably appeared to be entitled to payment.  The department shall reimburse the holder for payment even if the payment was made to a person whose claim was barred pursuant to section 44-321.

C. Without paying any fee or other charge, a holder who has delivered property other than money to the department pursuant to this chapter may reclaim the property if the property is still in the possession of the department and the holder files proof that the apparent owner has claimed the property from the holder.

D. The department may accept a holder's affidavit as sufficient proof of the holder's right to recover money and property under this chapter.

E. If a holder pays or delivers property to the department in good faith and after the payment or delivery another person claims the property from the holder or another state claims the money or property under that state's laws relating to escheat or abandoned or unclaimed property, on written notice of the claim the department shall defend the holder against the claim and indemnify the holder against any liability on the claim that results from payment or delivery of the property to the department.

F. If the department receives any property that is removed from a safe deposit box or any other safekeeping depository the department is subject to the holder's right to be reimbursed for the cost of the opening and to any valid lien or contract that provides for the holder to be reimbursed for unpaid rent or storage charges.  The department shall reimburse the holder from the proceeds that remain after deducting the expense incurred by the department in selling the property.

A. Except as otherwise provided in this section, within three years after receiving abandoned property the department shall sell the property to the highest bidder at a public sale at a location in this state that in the judgment of the department affords the most favorable market for the property.  The department may decline the highest bid and reoffer the property for sale if the department considers the bid to be insufficient. The department is not required to offer the property for sale if the department determines that the probable cost of the sale will exceed the proceeds from the sale.  Before conducting a sale pursuant to this section, the department shall cause a notice to be published at least three weeks before the sale in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the sale will occur.

A. After property has been paid or delivered to the department pursuant to this chapter, another state may recover the property if any of the following applies:

Actual written notice by the department to the last known address of the holder or potential holder of the revocation or modification of the private holder ruling or holder information ruling if the holder identifying information has been disclosed to the department pursuant to subsection E of this section.  If holder identifying information has not been disclosed, written notice by the department to the last known address of the holder representative who requested the ruling will constitute notice to the holder or potential holder.

D. With respect to the holder or prospective holder to whom the private holder ruling was issued, the revocation or modification of a private holder ruling shall not be applied retroactively to unclaimed property periods or years before the effective date of the revocation or modification, and the department shall not demand any penalty or interest attributable to erroneous advice that it furnished to the holder or potential holder in the private holder ruling if:

1. The holder reasonably relied on the private holder ruling.

2. The penalty or interest did not result either from a failure by the holder to provide adequate or accurate information or from a change in the information.

E. Subsection D of this section applies to a holder information ruling if the holder or potential holder provides its name, address, identifying number, if applicable, and authorization pursuant to section 44-315, subsection A, for the representative of the holder or potential holder before the date the department publishes the ruling.  The department shall notify the representative of the holder or potential holder of the proposed publication date.  If the director has determined that the holder information ruling should not be published pursuant to subsection L of this section, subsection D of this section applies if the holder or potential holder provides the identifying information before the date specified by the department on issuing the holder information ruling to the representative.  If the holder or potential holder does not provide the department with the identifying information and representative authorization before the proposed publication date or, for an unpublished ruling, the date specified by the department, the holder information ruling is not binding on the department for the purpose of abating interest, penalty or holder liability.

F. A private holder ruling or holder information ruling shall not be relied on, cited or introduced into evidence in any proceeding by a holder other than the holder who has received the private holder ruling or holder information ruling.

I. A private holder ruling or holder information ruling may be issued only if no unclaimed property liability has accrued with respect to the transactions, events or facts contained in the request.  The department may issue a private holder ruling or holder information ruling addressing a holder's ongoing business activities, except that the ruling applies only to transactions that occur or unclaimed property liabilities that accrue from and after the date the holder receives the ruling.

J. The department shall attempt to issue private holder rulings or holder information rulings within forty-five days after receiving the written request and on receiving the facts that are relevant to the ruling.  If the ruling is expected to be delayed, the department shall notify the requestor of the delay and the proposed date of issuance.

K. The department shall maintain the private holder ruling or holder information ruling as a public record and make it available at a reasonable cost for public inspection and copying.  The text of private holder rulings and holder information rulings is open to public inspection subject to the confidentiality requirements prescribed by title 42, chapter 2, article 1.

L. At the time of making a private holder ruling request or holder information ruling request, a holder or potential holder may submit a written request that the ruling not be published due to concerns about confidentiality or other disclosed reasons.  If the director determines that the ruling should not be published, the ruling shall be deemed confidential for the purpose of section 39-121.01, subsection D, paragraph 2.  If the director determines that the ruling should be published, the holder may withdraw the ruling request and the department shall not proceed with a ruling if the request is withdrawn.  Notwithstanding section 41-1092.02, the decision of the director to publish is not an appealable agency action as defined in section 41-1092 and is not subject to appeal by the holder.

If it appears in such action that the claim or the disputed part thereof is not lawfully due, the claim shall be disallowed in whole or in part, and the assignee shall be restrained from paying the claim or any portion disallowed.

C. The assignee shall permit any creditor to take a copy of any other creditor's statement of claim filed with the assignee.

#### Section 44-1040. Discount of claims allowed but not due; amount payable on claim secured by collateral in possession of creditor

If it appears in such action that the purchaser of such property bought it from the assignor in good faith for a valuable consideration and without reason to believe that the debtor was conveying or transferring the property with intent or design as set forth in this section, the purchaser shall be held to have acquired, as against the assignee and creditors, a good and valid title to the property.

#### Section 44-1042. Failure of assignor to supply inventory as prima facie evidence of concealment of property by assignor; examination of assignor by court upon application of assignee or creditor

A. No assignment shall be declared fraudulent or void for lack of an inventory or list as required under the provisions of this article, but if such list and inventory are not annexed and verified as provided in section 44-1033, it is prima facie evidence that the assignor has secreted and concealed some portion of his property from his assignee, unless, upon the demand of the assignee or a creditor, the verified inventory and list are furnished to the assignee.

B. If an assignee or creditor has reason to believe that a debtor has concealed any of his property or estate for the purpose of defrauding creditors, the superior court shall, upon application of the assignee or creditor, cause the debtor to appear before it and disclose under oath any knowledge or information he has of such concealment.

#### Section 44-1043. Attempted preference of creditor void

Any attempted preference, in the assignment, of one creditor or creditors of the assignor, is fraudulent and without effect.

#### Section 44-1044. Garnishment of assignee by nonconsenting creditor

A creditor, not consenting to the assignment, may proceed by garnishment against the assignee for the excess of property remaining in his hands after payment to consenting creditors the amount of their debts and the costs and expenses of the assignment.

#### Section 44-1045. Distribution to creditors; compensation and expenses allowed assignee

The report shall be under oath and shall set forth the money and assets which came into his possession, and how such assets were disbursed and disposed of. The assignee shall file the report in the office of the clerk of the superior court having jurisdiction of the insolvent estate.

B. A hearing shall be held on the report after notice to each known creditor, which shall be mailed at least ten days before the hearing. Approval of the report by the court shall be conclusive in favor of the assignee to the same extent as approval of a report in the case of any other trust.

C. When the trust is fully executed, the assignee may be discharged. Any monies or funds of the insolvent estate in the possession of the assignee at final settlement shall be deposited in the superior court subject to the judgment of the court.

#### Section 44-1205. Closed end loans of five thousand dollars or less; revolving accounts; check loan accounts; credit card revolving account; delinquency charges; prepayment rebates and additional charges; definition

A. The following apply to closed end loans, other than closed end loans subject to title 6, chapter 5, in which the principal amount of the loan does not exceed five thousand dollars:

1. Interest not to exceed the maximum rate set by contract may be charged. Interest may be computed either at the single annual percentage rate using the actuarial method or it may be precomputed on the assumption that all payments will be made in the amounts and on the dates scheduled and added to the principal of the loan. If interest is precomputed, the fact that payments are made either before or after the date due does not affect the amount of interest which the lender may charge or receive. If such precomputed interest loan balance is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, refinancing or otherwise, the lender or holder shall charge only for interest which has been earned and unpaid late or delinquency charges as of the date of prepayment, and the borrower shall receive a rebate of that portion of the precomputed interest which is the difference between the total precomputed interest charges and the charges at the contract interest rate computed on the unpaid principal balance based on the number of days or months to maturity based on either a thirty-day month-three hundred sixty day year or daily three hundred sixty-five or three hundred sixty-six day year on the number of days remaining to final maturity. The amount of such rebate shall not be computed pursuant to the method commonly known as the "rule of 78's". To simplify the calculation of earned interest, it is permissible to assume that all payments were made as originally scheduled or as otherwise mutually agreed.

2. It is permissible to calculate interest on an annual basis of twelve months of thirty days each, or on a daily basis if a day is counted either as 1/360th, 1/365th, or 1/366th of a year, as the lender and borrower may agree by writing. The lender may also charge a late payment or delinquency charge, in addition to all interest charges permitted, on each installment not paid in full within ten days of its due date in an amount not to exceed five per cent of the installment or ten dollars, whichever is less.

B. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, revolving accounts in which the agreed upon credit limit does not exceed ten thousand dollars are subject to the provisions of this subsection. Under a revolving loan account of any lender, other than a consumer revolving loan subject to title 6, chapter 5, or resulting from a check loan account, which the borrower may pay at any time but has the privilege of paying in installments, if the interest charge is not precomputed, interest not to exceed the maximum rate set by contract may be charged on the unpaid balances of the account, calculated as of the regular monthly billing date or on the actual daily balances outstanding. The lender may also charge a late payment or delinquency charge on each installment not paid in full within ten days of its due date in an amount not to exceed five per cent of the installment or ten dollars, whichever is less. If a lender makes a loan to a borrower by purchasing or satisfying obligations of the borrower pursuant to a lender credit card or similar arrangement, and the purchase or satisfaction is made at less than the face amount of the obligation, the discount shall not be considered to be interest. If an arrangement constitutes both a revolving loan account under this subsection and a retail installment transaction under section 44-6001, it is governed by this subsection or section 44-6002 as the parties may agree.

C. Except as provided in subsection D of this section a credit card revolving account, including an account that permits access by check, is governed by the laws of this state and is subject to this subsection. Under a credit card revolving account, which the borrower may pay at any time but has the privilege of paying in installments, interest not to exceed the maximum rate set by contract may be charged on the unpaid balances of the account, calculated as of the regular monthly billing date or on the actual or average daily balances outstanding. If the contract provides, the issuer or holder of a credit card revolving account may charge and collect as interest and include in the balances of the account, in addition to or in lieu of interest on the unpaid balances of the account, any of the following:

1. An annual or other periodic charge.

2. A transaction charge for each separate purchase or loan.

3. A minimum interest charge for each regular billing date on which interest charges are due on the unpaid balances.

4. A late payment or delinquency charge.

5. A returned payment charge.

6. A stop payment charge.

7. An overlimit charge.

8. A charge for providing invoices, checks or documentary evidence.

9. A fee incident to the application for and the opening and administration of the credit card account.

10. An automated teller machine or similar electronic or interchange fee or charge.

If a credit card issuer makes a loan to a borrower by purchasing or satisfying an obligation of the borrower pursuant to the use of a lender credit card or similar arrangement and the purchase or satisfaction is made at less than the face amount of the obligation, the discount is not considered interest.

D. If a contract constitutes either a credit card revolving account under subsection C of this section or a retail charge account agreement as defined in section 44-6001, and the agreed upon credit limit of the account or agreement does not exceed ten thousand dollars it is governed in its entirety by subsection C of this section or section 44-6002 as the parties may agree.

E. The limitations of this subsection apply only to the loans described in subsections A, B and C of this section. In addition to the other charges authorized by subsections A, B and C of this section, the lender may charge the borrower only for the lawful fees actually paid by the lender for filing or recording in a public office, for motor vehicle title, registration, assessor's fees and lien filing fees, for escrow fees of an escrow agent as defined by section 6-801, for acknowledging the instrument securing the loan and for costs of obtaining a preliminary title report and title insurance policy. The lender shall not charge or receive any sums for any other service or expense, except in connection with a loan to a participant or beneficiary from a retirement plan which is qualified under section 401(a) of the internal revenue code as defined in section 42-1001 and except for casualty or other insurance covering the security for the loan and credit life and disability and unemployment insurance, even if actually paid to a third party. This section does not preclude a lender from charging the borrower for the payment of court costs, expenses and reasonable attorney fees if the loan is referred for collection to an attorney other than a salaried employee of the lender or holder. If greater aggregate charges are collected or received on a loan than the maximum charges authorized by this section the loan is usurious.

F. All terms, conditions and other provisions relating to revolving accounts as provided in subsections B, C and E of this section and other lawful provisions of the contract governing the revolving loan account are deemed to be material to the determination of interest applicable to revolving accounts under the laws of this state, the most favored lender doctrine and section 85 of the national bank act (12 United States Code section 85) or section 521 of the depository institutions deregulation and monetary control act of 1980 (12 United States Code section 1831d).

G. Subsection C of this section does not apply to loans made by a person who is a licensee under title 6, chapter 5 or 9, or both, or any affiliate of such a licensee which is not a federally insured depository institution.

H. In this section, "actuarial method" means the method of allocating payments made on a debt between the unpaid principal balance and the interest pursuant to which a payment is applied first to the interest due and any remainder is subtracted from the unpaid principal balance.

#### Section 44-1206. Effect of obligations insured or guaranteed by the United States

No law requiring security upon which loans may be made, prescribing the nature, amount or form of such security, prescribing or limiting interest rates upon loans, or prescribing or limiting the period for which loans may be made, shall apply to loans, advances of credit, or purchases of obligations representing loans and advances of credit payment of which is insured or guaranteed by the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof.

#### Section 44-1207. Interest on lawful charge, fee, cost or expense

Any lawful charge, fee, cost or expense paid by or due to a lender on behalf of a borrower, with his consent, may be added to the principal amount of a loan made to such borrower under the provisions of this title or under the provisions of title 6, and such amount shall become part of the principal and interest may be charged thereon as provided by law.

#### Section 44-1208. Loans secured by real estate; prohibited practices; insurance

Except for consumer lender loans regulated pursuant to section 6-636, for any loan that is secured by real property, a person shall not require as a condition of the loan that the borrower obtain property insurance coverage in an amount that exceeds the replacement cost of the improvements as established by the property insurer.

You (the purchaser) will have to pay up to $25.00 for each of the first two repairs if the warranty is violated.

H. The inclusion of the statement prescribed in subsection G of this section in the agreement does not create an express warranty.

1. The used motor vehicle dealer fully and accurately discloses to the purchaser that because of circumstances unusual to the used motor vehicle dealer's business, the used motor vehicle has a particular defect.

This warranty provides that the assistive device will be free from any defect, malfunction or condition that substantially impairs its use, safety or value.

To ensure that you receive the benefits of this warranty, within one year after the initial delivery to you of the assistive device, you must report any problem with the assistive device to the manufacturer, authorized assistive device dealer or assistive device lessor and make the assistive device available for repair by the manufacturer, authorized assistive device dealer or assistive device lessor.

During the warranty period, if any defect, malfunction or condition cannot be repaired after two attempts or if your assistive device is out of service for at least thirty days for repair of any defect, malfunction or condition that substantially impairs the use, safety or value of the assistive device, you are entitled to either a comparable new assistive device or a refund of the full purchase price plus any finance charge and collateral cost minus a reasonable allowance for use. If you are leasing an assistive device you are entitled to either a comparable assistive device or a refund of the amount paid under the written lease plus all collateral costs minus a reasonable allowance for use.

The warranty provided to you by law does not cover any defect, malfunction or condition that results from an accident involving the assistive device or from neglect, modification or alteration of the assistive device by any person other than the manufacturer or the manufacturer's agent or distributor or an authorized assistive device dealer or assistive device lessor and the warranty relieves the manufacturer of liability for repairs in these instances.

A manufacturer may refuse to replace an assistive device or may refuse to refund the purchase price if the problem does not substantially impair the use, safety or value of your assistive device.

A contract or agreement for the sale or lease of an assistive device cannot void any of these rights.

#### Section 44-1355. Exemption; waiver of rights; action to recover damages; attorney fees

A. An assistive device dealer is not liable to a manufacturer for a refund if the assistive device dealer makes a repair in a manner that is consistent with the manufacturer's instructions.

B. This section does not limit any rights or remedies available to a consumer under any other law. Any waiver of rights by a consumer is void.

C. In addition to any other remedy, a consumer may bring an action in superior court to recover damages caused by a violation of this section. The court may award the prevailing consumer triple the amount of any pecuniary loss plus costs, disbursements and attorney fees. The court may also award any equitable relief deemed appropriate by the court.

Except as provided in subsection H of this section, a registration pursuant to this section is not available for the securities of an issuer if the issuer or any of its predecessors, affiliates, directors, officers, general partners or beneficial owners of ten per cent or more of any class of its equity securities, or the managing underwriter of the securities:

2. Every person who was a director or person performing similar functions of the issuer or partner in the issuer at the time of the filing of the part of the registration statement.

5. Every underwriter with respect to the security.

B. If a person acquires the security after the issuer has made generally available to its security holders an earnings statement covering a period of at least twelve months beginning after the effective date of the registration statement, the right of recovery under subsection A is conditioned on proof that the person acquired the security relying on the untrue statement in the registration statement or relying on the registration statement and not knowing of the omission. Reliance may be established without proof that the person read the registration statement.

C. No person other than the issuer is liable under subsections A and B who proves any of the following:

1. Before the effective date of the part of the registration statement for which liability is asserted the person both:

(a) Had resigned from or had taken steps permitted by law to resign from, or had ceased or refused to act in every office, capacity or relationship in which the person was described in the registration statement as acting or agreeing to act.

(b) Had advised the issuer and either the commission or the SEC in writing that the person had taken the action and that the person would not be responsible for that part of the registration statement.

2. If that part of the registration statement became effective without the person's knowledge, on becoming aware of that fact the person promptly acted and advised either the commission or the SEC, in accordance with paragraph 1 of this subsection and gave reasonable public notice that the part of the registration statement had become effective without the person's knowledge.

3. Regarding any part of the registration statement:

(a) Not purporting to be made on the authority of an expert and not purporting to be a copy of or extract from a report or valuation of an expert, and not purporting to be made on the authority of a public official document or statement, the person after reasonable investigation had reasonable grounds to believe and did believe at the time that part of the registration statement became effective, that the statements in that part of the registration statement were true and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not misleading.

(b) Purporting to be made on the person's authority as an expert or purporting to be a copy of or extract from a report or valuation of the person as an expert either of the following:

(i) The person had after reasonable investigation reasonable grounds to believe and did believe at the time that part of the registration statement became effective that the statements contained in that part of the registration statement were true and that there was no omission to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not misleading.

(ii) That part of the registration statement did not fairly represent the person's statement as an expert or was not a fair copy of or extract from the person's report or valuation as an expert.

(c) Purporting to be made on the authority of another expert or purporting to be a copy of or extract from a report or valuation of another expert, the person had no reasonable grounds to believe and did not believe at the time that part of the registration statement became effective that the statements in that part of the registration statement were untrue or that there was an omission to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not misleading, or that part of the registration statement did not fairly represent the statement of the expert or was not a fair copy of or extract from the report or valuation of the expert.

(d) Purporting to be a statement made by an official or purporting to be a copy of or extract from a public official document, the person had no reasonable grounds to believe and did not believe at the time that part of the registration statement became effective that the statements were untrue or that there was an omission to state a material fact required to be stated or necessary to make the statements not misleading, or that part of the registration statement did not fairly represent the statement made by the official or was not a fair copy of or extract from the public official document.

D. In determining for the purposes of subsection C, paragraph 3 what constitutes reasonable investigation and reasonable grounds for belief, the standard of reasonableness is the standard required of a prudent person in the management of the person's own property.

E. If any person becomes an underwriter of the security after the part of the registration statement with respect to which the person's liability is asserted becomes effective, for the purposes of subsection C, paragraph 3 that part of the registration statement shall be considered effective with respect to the person as of the date the person became an underwriter.

F. If the defendant proves that any portion or all of the damages represents an amount other than the depreciation in value of the security resulting from the statement described in subsection A, the portion or all of the damages are not recoverable.  The action authorized under subsection A or B may be to recover the damages represented by the difference between the amount paid for the security, not to exceed the price at which the security was offered to the public, and any of the following:

1. The value of the security as of the time the action was brought.

2. The price at which the security was disposed of in the market before the action was brought.

3. The price at which the security was disposed of after the action but before judgment if the damages are less than they would be if determined under paragraph 1 of this subsection.

G. Unless the underwriter has knowingly received directly or indirectly from the issuer for acting as an underwriter some benefit in which all other underwriters similarly situated did not share in proportion to their respective interests in the underwriting, the underwriter is not liable in any action or as a consequence of an action brought under subsection A for damages greater than the total price at which the securities underwritten by the underwriter and distributed to the public were offered to the public.

H. In any action under this section the court may require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of the action, including reasonable attorney fees.  If judgment is rendered against a party on the motion of the other party, the costs may be assessed in favor of the party whether or not the undertaking has been required if the court believes the action or the defense to have been without merit, in an amount sufficient to reimburse the party for the reasonable expenses incurred by the party in connection with the action.  The costs awarded are taxable in the manner usually provided for taxing of costs in the court in which the action was heard.

I. Any or all of the persons specified in subsection A shall be jointly and severally liable.  Every person who becomes liable for any payment under this section may recover contribution from any person who, if sued separately, would have been liable for the same payment, unless the person who has become liable also is guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation under federal securities laws and the other person is not.

J. The amount recoverable under this section shall not exceed the price at which the security was offered to the public.

The purchaser may bring an action in any court or administrative forum of competent jurisdiction to recover the consideration paid for the security with interest, minus the amount of any income received from the security, on the tender of the security, or for damages if the purchaser no longer owns the security.

B. Every person who, directly or indirectly, controls any person liable for a violation of section 44-1991 or 44-1992 is liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as the controlled person to any person to whom the controlled person is liable unless the controlling person acted in good faith and did not directly or indirectly induce the act underlying the action.

The responses to the interrogatories or findings under subsection D of this section shall specify the total amount of damages that the plaintiff is entitled to recover and the percentage of responsibility of each covered person found to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff or plaintiffs. In determining the percentage of responsibility under this section, the trier of fact shall consider both the nature and extent of:

1. The conduct of each covered person found to have caused or contributed to the loss incurred by the plaintiff or plaintiffs.

2. The causal relationship between the conduct of each covered person and the damages incurred by the plaintiff or plaintiffs.

F. Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, on a motion made within six months after a final judgment is entered in any private action, if the court determines that all or part of the share of the judgment of the covered person is not collectible against that covered person and is also not collectible against a covered person described in subsection B of this section, each covered person described in subsection C of this section is liable for the uncollectible share as follows:

1. Each covered person is jointly and severally liable for the uncollectible share if the plaintiff establishes that the plaintiff is an individual whose recoverable damages under the final judgment are greater than ten per cent of the net worth of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff's net worth is less than two hundred thousand dollars, excluding the value of the plaintiff's owned primary residence.

2. With respect to any plaintiff not described in paragraph 1 of this subsection, each covered person is liable for the uncollectible share in proportion to the percentage of responsibility of that covered person, except that the total liability of a covered person under this subsection may not exceed fifty per cent of the proportionate share of that covered person, as determined under subsection E of this section.

G. For purposes of subsection F of this section, net worth is determined as of the date immediately preceding the date of the purchase or sale by the plaintiff of the security that is the subject of the action and is equal to the fair market value of assets, minus liabilities, including the net value of the plaintiff's investments in real and personal property and personal residences.

H. The total payments required pursuant to subsection F of this section shall not exceed the amount of the uncollectible share. A covered person against whom judgment is not collectible is subject to contribution and to any continuing liability to the plaintiff on the judgment.

I. To the extent that a covered person is required to make an additional payment pursuant to subsection F of this section, the covered person may recover contribution from any of the following or any combination of the following:

1. The covered person originally liable to make the payment.

2. Any covered person liable jointly and severally pursuant to subsection B of this section.

3. Any covered person who is held proportionately liable pursuant to this section, who is liable to make the same payment and who has paid less than the person's proportionate share of that payment.

4. Any other person who is responsible for the conduct giving rise to the payment and who would have been liable to make the same payment.

J. The standard for allocation of damages under subsections B, C and D of this section and the procedure for reallocation of uncollectible shares under subsection F of this section shall not be disclosed to members of the jury.

K. If a covered person settles any private action at any time before a final verdict or judgment, the court shall enter an order discharging the covered person from all claims for contribution brought by other persons. On entry of the settlement by the court, the court shall enter a bar order constituting the final discharge of all obligations to the plaintiff of the settling covered person arising out of the action. The order bars all future claims for contribution arising out of the action by:

1. Any person against the settling covered person.

2. The settling covered person against any person, other than a person whose liability has been extinguished by the settlement of the settling covered person.

L. If a covered person enters into a settlement with the plaintiff before a final verdict or judgment, the verdict or judgment shall be reduced by the greater of either:

1. The amount that corresponds to the percentage of responsibility of that covered person.

2. The amount paid to the plaintiff by that covered person.

M. Except as provided in subsection K of this section, a covered person who becomes jointly and severally liable for damages in any private action may recover contribution from any other person who, if joined in the original action, would have been liable for the same damages. A claim for contribution shall be determined based on the percentage of responsibility of the claimant and of each person against whom a claim for contribution is made.

N. In any private action determining liability, an action for contribution shall be brought within six months after the entry of a final, nonappealable judgment in the action, except that an action for contribution brought by a covered person who was required to make an additional payment pursuant to subsection F of this section may be brought within six months after the date on which the payment was made.

O. For purposes of this section, reckless conduct by a covered person does not constitute a knowing violation of this chapter by the covered person.

P. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Covered person" means a defendant in any private action arising under sections 44-1991 and 44-1992 or a defendant who is an outside director in a private action arising under section 44-1997.

2. "Knowingly committed a violation of this chapter" means either:

(a) In an action that is based on an untrue statement of material fact or omission of a material fact necessary to make the statement not misleading, the covered person makes an untrue statement of a material fact with actual knowledge that the representation is false or omits the statement of a fact necessary in order to make the statement made not misleading, with actual knowledge that, as a result of the omission, one of the material representations of the covered person is false and other persons are likely to reasonably rely on that misrepresentation or omission.

(b) In an action that is based on any conduct that is not described in subdivision (a), the covered person engages in conduct with actual knowledge of the facts and circumstances that make the conduct of that covered person a violation of this chapter.

#### Section 44-2004. Limitation of civil actions

A. No civil action shall be maintained under this article to enforce any liability based on a violation of section 44-1841 or 44-1842 unless brought within one year after the violation occurs.

B. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, no civil action shall be brought under this article to enforce any liability based on a violation of article 13 of this chapter unless brought within two years after discovery of the fraudulent practice on which the liability is based, or after the discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence.

C. No civil action shall be brought under this article to enforce any liability based on a violation of section 44-1997 or 44-1998 unless brought within two years after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission. No action shall be brought to enforce a liability created under section 44-1997 more than five years after a bona fide offer of the security to the public or under section 44-1998 more than five years after the sale of the security.

 

#### Section 44-2005. Remedy not exclusive

Nothing in this article shall limit any statutory or common law right of any person in any court for any act involved in the sale of securities.

On certification by the president that a company desiring to list its securities for trading on the exchange meets all formal listing requirements, the board shall make a determination whether the proposed listing is in the public interest.

### Article 18 - Private Securities Litigation

#### Section 44-2081. Private securities class action litigation

A. This section applies in each private action that arises under this chapter and that is brought as a plaintiff class action pursuant to the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules.

B. Each plaintiff seeking to serve as a representative party on behalf of a class shall provide a sworn certification to the court that is signed by the plaintiff, filed with the complaint and includes a statement that:

1. The plaintiff has reviewed the complaint and has authorized its filing.

2. The plaintiff did not purchase the security that is the subject of the complaint at the direction of the plaintiff's counsel or in order to participate in any private action arising under this chapter.

3. The plaintiff is willing to serve as a representative party on behalf of a class, including providing testimony at a deposition or trial.

4. Sets forth all of the plaintiff's transactions involving the security that is the subject of the complaint during the class period specified in the complaint.

5. Identifies any other action under this chapter, the securities act of 1933 (15 United States Code sections 77a through 77bbbb) or the securities exchange act of 1934 (15 United States Code sections 78a through 78ll) filed within three years before the plaintiff signs the certification in which the plaintiff has sought to serve as a representative party on behalf of a class.

6. The plaintiff will not accept any payment for serving as a representative party on behalf of a class beyond the plaintiff's pro rata share of any recovery, except as ordered or approved by the court in accordance with subsection J.

C. The certification filed pursuant to subsection B is not a waiver of the attorney-client privilege.

D. Within twenty days after the date on which the complaint is filed, the plaintiff or plaintiffs shall publish, in a widely circulated national business-oriented publication or wire service, a notice advising members of the purported plaintiff class of the pendency of the action, the claims asserted and the purported class period.  The notice shall include a statement that, within sixty days after the date on which the notice is published, any member of the purported class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff of the purported class. If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the same claim or claims arising under this article is filed, only the plaintiff or plaintiffs in the first filed action are required to publish the notice.  The notice is in addition to any notice required pursuant to the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules.  Notwithstanding this subsection, the court may narrow the geographic scope of the publication of the notice required by this subsection, if the court finds that substantially all members of the class would receive notice.

E. Within ninety days after the date on which a notice is published under subsection D the court shall consider any motion made by a purported class member in response to the notice, including any motion by a class member who is not individually named as a plaintiff in the complaint or complaints, and shall appoint the most adequate plaintiff as lead plaintiff. The most adequate plaintiff is that member or members of the purported plaintiff class that the court determines to be most capable of adequately representing the interests of class members in accordance with this subsection.  Subject to subsection F, the court shall adopt a presumption that the most adequate plaintiff in any private action arising under this chapter is the person or group of persons that has either filed the complaint or made a motion in response to a notice under subsection D, in the determination of the court has the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class and otherwise satisfies the requirements of rule 23 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules.

F. The presumption prescribed in subsection E may be rebutted only on proof by a member of the purported plaintiff class that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff will not fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class or is subject to unique defenses that render that plaintiff incapable of adequately representing the class.  A plaintiff may conduct discovery relating to whether a member or members of the purported plaintiff class are the most adequate plaintiff if the plaintiff demonstrates a reasonable basis for a finding that the presumptively most adequate plaintiff is incapable of adequately representing the class.

G. If more than one action on behalf of a class asserting substantially the same claim or claims arising under this chapter has been filed, and any party has sought to consolidate those actions for pretrial purposes or for trial, the court shall not make the determination required by subsection E until after the decision on the motion to consolidate is rendered.  As soon as practicable after the decision is rendered, the court shall appoint the most adequate plaintiff as lead plaintiff for the consolidated actions in accordance with this section.

H. Subject to the approval of the court, the most adequate plaintiff shall select and retain counsel to represent the class.

I. Except as the court permits and consistent with the purposes of this section, a person may be a lead plaintiff, or an officer, director or fiduciary of a lead plaintiff, in not more than five class actions during any three consecutive years brought as plaintiff class actions pursuant to the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any federal counterpart to the rules.

J. The share of any final judgment or of any settlement that is awarded to a representative party serving on behalf of a class shall be equal on a per share basis to the portion of the final judgment or settlement awarded to all other members of the class.  Nothing in this subsection limits the award of reasonable costs and expenses, including lost wages, directly relating to the representation of the class to any representative party serving on behalf of a class.

K. The terms and provisions of any settlement agreement of a class action shall not be filed under seal, except that on a motion by any party to the settlement, the court may order filing under seal for those portions of a settlement agreement as to which good cause is shown for filing under seal.  For purposes of this subsection, good cause exists if publication of a term or provision of a settlement agreement would cause direct and substantial harm to any party.

L. Attorney fees and costs awarded by the court to counsel for the plaintiff class shall not exceed a reasonable percentage of the amount of any damages and prejudgment interest actually paid to the class.

M. Any proposed or final settlement agreement that is published or disseminated to the class shall include a cover page summarizing the information contained in the settlement agreement and:

#### Section 44-2082. Requirements for securities fraud actions involving misleading statements or omissions

A. In any private action arising under section 44-1991 or 44-1992 in which the plaintiff alleges that the defendant made an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted a statement of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, the complaint shall specify each alleged untrue statement or material omission and the reason or reasons why the statement or omission is misleading or the omission is material and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission is made on information and belief, the complaint shall state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.

B. In any private action arising under section 44-1991 or 44-1992 in which the plaintiff may recover money damages only on proof that the defendant acted with a particular state of mind, for each act or omission that allegedly violates section 44-1991 or 44-1992, the complaint shall state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.

C. In any private action arising under section 44-1991 or 44-1992:

1. On any defendant's motion, the court shall dismiss the complaint if the requirements of subsections A and B of this section are not met.

2. All discovery and other proceedings shall be stayed during the pendency of any motion to dismiss pursuant to rule 12 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure, unless the court finds on the motion of any party that particularized discovery is necessary to preserve evidence or to prevent undue prejudice to that party.

D. During the pendency of any stay of discovery pursuant to subsection C of this section, unless ordered by the court, any party to the action with actual notice of the allegations contained in the complaint shall treat all documents, data compilations, including electronically recorded or stored data, and tangible objects that are in the custody or control of that person and that are relevant to the allegations as if they were the subject of a continuing request for production of documents from an opposing party under the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any applicable federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules.  A party aggrieved by the wilful failure of an opposing party to comply with this subsection may apply to the court for an order awarding appropriate sanctions.

E. Except as provided in section 44-1991, subsection B, including actions based on allegations of activities constituting dishonest or unethical practices in the securities industry, in any private action arising under this chapter, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the act or omission of the defendant alleged to violate the section under which the private action is brought caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages.

 

#### Section 44-2083. Sanctions for abusive litigation

A. In any private action arising under this chapter, on final adjudication of the action, unless the parties stipulate otherwise, the court shall include in the record specific findings regarding compliance by each party and each attorney representing any party with each requirement of rule 11(b) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any applicable federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules as to any complaint, responsive pleading or dispositive motion. If the federal or other jurisdictional rules of civil procedure do not have a counterpart to rule 11(b) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure, rule 11(b) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure applies.

B. If the court makes a finding under subsection A that a party or attorney violated any requirement of rule 11(b) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules as to any complaint, responsive pleading or dispositive motion, the court shall impose sanctions on that party or attorney in accordance with rule 11 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules. Before making a finding that any party or attorney has violated the applicable rules, the court shall give that party or attorney notice and an opportunity to respond.

C. Subject to subsections D and E, for the purposes of subsection B, the court shall adopt a presumption that the appropriate sanctions for:

1. Failure of any responsive pleading or dispositive motion to comply with any requirement of rule 11(b) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any applicable federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules is an award to the opposing party of reasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred as a direct result of the violation.

2. Substantial failure of any complaint to comply with any requirement of rule 11(b) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules is an award to the opposing party of reasonable attorney fees and other expenses incurred in the action.

D. The presumption prescribed in subsection C may be rebutted only on proof by the party or attorney against whom sanctions are to be imposed that either of the following applies:

1. The award of attorney fees and other expenses will impose an unreasonable burden on that party or attorney and would be unjust, and the failure to make an award would not impose a greater burden on the party in whose favor sanctions are to be imposed.

2. The violation of rule 11(b) of the Arizona rules of civil procedure or federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules was de minimis.

E. If the party or attorney against whom sanctions are to be imposed meets the burden prescribed by subsection D, the court shall award the sanctions that the court deems appropriate pursuant to rule 11 of the Arizona rules of civil procedure or any applicable federal or other jurisdictional counterpart to the rules.

#### Section 44-2084. Right to written interrogatories

B. In any private action arising under section 44-1991 or 44-1992 in which the plaintiff seeks to establish damages by reference to the market price of a security, if the plaintiff sells or repurchases the security before the expiration of the ninety day period prescribed in subsection A of this section, the plaintiff's damages shall not exceed the difference between the purchase or sale price paid or received by the plaintiff for the security and the mean trading price of the security during the period beginning immediately after dissemination of information correcting the misstatement or omission and ending on the date on which the plaintiff sells or repurchases the security.

C. This section shall not apply to damages caused by a violation of section 44-1841 or 44-1842.

#### Section 44-6002. Retail installment contracts; retail charge account agreements; definitions

A. Under a retail installment contract, other than a retail charge account agreement, a finance charge not to exceed a rate set by contract may be charged and received. The finance charge may be computed either at the single annual percentage rate using the actuarial method or it may be precomputed on the assumption that all payments will be made in the amount and on the dates scheduled. If the finance charge is precomputed, the fact that payments are made either before or after the date due does not affect the amount of finance charge which the seller or holder may charge or receive. If such precomputed contract balance is prepaid in full by cash, a new loan, refinancing or otherwise, the seller or holder shall charge only for the finance charge which has been earned and unpaid late or delinquency charges as of the date of prepayment and the buyer shall receive a rebate of that portion of the precomputed finance charge which is the difference between the total precomputed finance charges and the charges at the contract finance charge rate computed on the unpaid principal balance based on the number of days or months to maturity based on either a thirty day month - three hundred sixty day year or daily three hundred sixty-five or three hundred sixty-six day year on the number of days remaining to maturity. The amount of such rebate shall not be computed pursuant to the method commonly known as the "rule of 78's". To simplify the calculation of earned finance charge, it is permissible to assume that all payments were made as originally scheduled or as otherwise mutually agreed.

B. It is permissible to calculate the finance charge on an annual basis of twelve months of thirty days each, or on a daily basis if a day is counted either as 1/360th, 1/365th, or 1/366th of a year, as the purchaser and seller or holder may agree by writing. The seller or holder may also charge a late payment or delinquency charge, in addition to all finance charges permitted, on each installment not paid in full upon the tenth day after its due date in an amount not to exceed five dollars on an installment of twenty-five dollars or less and ten dollars on an installment greater than twenty-five dollars.

C. A retail installment contract which otherwise conforms to the requirements of this chapter may contain provisions which relate to additional goods and services authorizing any of the following:

1. The seller may add subsequent purchases made by the buyer to the contract.

2. The total price of the goods or services covered by the contract may be increased by the price of such additional goods or services.

3. The seller may increase proportionately all finance charges and installment payments.

4. All terms and conditions of the contract may apply equally to such additional goods or services.

5. The contract may provide for a consolidation of subsequent purchases with one or more of the previous contracts or may provide for a series of sales transactions made pursuant to an agreement providing for the addition of the principal balance, plus the finance charge for the current sale, to an existing balance.

6. The goods purchased under the previous contract or contracts may be security for the goods purchased under the subsequent contract, but only until such time as the total of payments under the previous contract or contracts is fully paid.

D. Under a retail charge account agreement a rate of finance charge not to exceed the maximum rate set by contract may be charged and received on an amount not in excess of the greatest of any of the following:

1. The average daily balance in the account in the billing cycle period.

2. The balance in the account at the beginning of the billing cycle period, after first deducting payments and credits received during the billing cycle period.

3. The median amount within a ten dollar range in which the balance as computed under paragraph 1 or 2 of this subsection falls if the seller applies the same finance charge to all such balances within such range.

E. As used in this section, month need not be a calendar month but may, instead, be a regular billing cycle period. If the finance charge for the billing cycle period is less than fifty cents, a minimum finance charge not in excess of fifty cents may be charged for the period.

F. The seller or holder may also charge a late payment or delinquency charge, in addition to all finance charges permitted, on each installment not paid in full upon the tenth day after its due date in an amount not to exceed five dollars on an installment of twenty-five dollars or less and ten dollars on an installment greater than twenty-five dollars. As an alternative, if a seller or holder does not charge, collect or receive a finance charge as permitted in this chapter, he is entitled to charge, collect and receive a delinquency charge determined by applying any rate of interest to the delinquent balance if such interest charge is provided for in the retail charge account agreement.

G. Notwithstanding the late payment or delinquency charge provided in subsection B or F, in a commercial transaction, the seller or holder may charge a late payment or delinquency charge, in addition to all finance charges permitted, on each installment not paid in full upon the tenth day after its due date in an amount of not more than five per cent of the unpaid balance of the installment.

H. A seller or holder who receives a check, draft, negotiable order of withdrawal or similar instrument which is drawn on a bank or other depository institution and which is offered by a buyer in payment of an installment may, if the instrument is not paid or is dishonored by the institution, charge and collect from the buyer a bad check charge in the amount of either ten dollars or the actual charge made to the seller or holder by the depository institution for the return of the unpaid or dishonored instrument, whichever is greater.

I. A retail charge account agreement may also provide for the payment of court costs and for reasonable attorneys' fees if it is referred for collection to an attorney other than a salaried employee of the holder of the retail charge account agreement.

J. In this section:

1. "Actuarial method" means the method of allocating payments made on a debt between the unpaid principal balance and the finance charge pursuant to which a payment is applied first to the finance charge due and any remainder is subtracted from the unpaid principal balance.

2. "Commercial transaction" means a transaction in which the goods or services are intended by the borrower for use primarily for other than personal, family or household purposes.

#### Section 44-6004. Assignment or transfers

A. The provisions of this section shall apply notwithstanding any law to the contrary.

B. An assignee may purchase or acquire any retail installment contract or retail charge account agreement or any outstanding balance under either from a seller or holder on terms, conditions and price as may be mutually agreed upon.

C. Notice to the buyer of the assignment and any requirement that the transferor be deprived of dominion over payments upon a retail installment contract or retail charge account agreement or over the goods if returned to or repossessed by the seller or holder, is not necessary to the validity of a written assignment of the retail installment contract or retail charge account agreement or any outstanding balance under either as against creditors, subsequent purchasers, pledgees, mortgagees or lien claimants of the transferor.

D. Unless the buyer has notice of the assignment of his retail installment contract, retail charge account agreement or any outstanding balance under either, payment made by the buyer to the holder last known to him is binding upon all subsequent holders.

E. A holder may acquire from a retail seller or another holder invoices or other memoranda evidencing retail sales on such terms, conditions and price, discount or other charge as may be mutually agreed upon. Such price, discount or other charge is not a part of the time price differential or delinquency charge permitted.

#### Section 44-6005. Periodic statements required

Except where the seller or holder deems an account pursuant to a retail charge account agreement to be uncollectible or where delinquency collection procedures have been instituted with respect to such an account, the seller or holder of the account shall, within a reasonable time after the end of the periodic billing cycle, mail or deliver to the buyer who is obligated pursuant to the terms of such agreement, for each billing cycle at the end of which there is an outstanding balance in excess of one dollar in that account or with respect to which a finance charge is imposed, a statement or statements which the buyer may retain. A reasonable time after the end of the billing cycle is presumed to be fifteen days.

#### Section 44-6006. Violation; bar to recovery

A seller or holder who violates any provision of this chapter is barred from recovery of any finance charge, official fees and delinquency charge under or in connection with the related retail installment contract or the related retail charge account agreement for as long as the violation continues. This section does not bar the seller or holder from recovery from the buyer of an amount equal to the cash price of the goods or services and the cost to the seller or holder of any insurance included in the transaction.

The supplier has the burden of demonstrating this fact.

#### Section 44-6703. Dealer agreements; cancellation

A. Unless one or more of subsection B, paragraphs 1 through 10 apply, a supplier shall give an equipment dealer ninety days' written notice of the supplier's intent to terminate, cancel or not renew a dealer agreement or to change the competitive circumstances of that agreement.

#### Section 44-7010. Effect of change or error

A. The following apply to any change or error in an electronic record that occurs in a transmission between the parties to a transaction:

1. If the parties have agreed to use a security procedure to detect changes or errors and one party has conformed to the procedure but the other party has not, and the nonconforming party would have detected the change or error had that party also conformed, the conforming party may avoid the effect of the changed or erroneous electronic record.

2. In an automated transaction that involves an individual, the individual may avoid the effect of an electronic record that resulted from an error made by the individual in dealing with the electronic agent of another person if the electronic agent did not provide an opportunity for the prevention or correction of the error and, at the time the individual learns of the error, the individual:

(a) Promptly notifies the other person of the error and that the individual did not intend to be bound by the electronic record received by the other person.

(b) Takes reasonable steps, including steps that conform to the other person's reasonable instructions, to return to the other person or, if instructed by the other person, to destroy the consideration received, if any, as a result of the erroneous electronic record.

C. The parties to the transaction shall not agree to vary the requirements prescribed in subsection A, paragraph 2 and subsection B.

 

#### Section 44-7011. Notarization; acknowledgment

If a law requires a signature or record to be notarized, acknowledged, verified or made under oath, that requirement is satisfied if the electronic signature of the person authorized to perform those acts, together with all other information required to be included by other applicable law, is attached to or logically associated with the signature or record.

#### Section 44-7012. Electronic records retention; originals; definition

A. If a law requires that a record be retained, the requirement is satisfied by retaining an electronic record of the information in the record that:

1. Accurately reflects the information prescribed in the record after the record was first generated in its final form as an electronic record or otherwise.

2. Remains accessible for later reference.

B. A person may satisfy subsection A of this section by using the services of another person to satisfy subsection A of this section.

C. If a law requires:

1. A record to be presented or retained in its original form, or provides consequences if the record is not presented or retained in its original form, that law is satisfied by an electronic record retained according to subsection A of this section.

2. Retention of a check, that requirement is satisfied by retention of an electronic record of the information on the front and back of the check according to subsection A of this section.

B. In addition to subsection A, paragraphs 1 and 2, the terms of any contract are determined by the substantive law that applies to that contract.

 

#### Section 44-7015. Time and place of sending and receipt

A. Unless otherwise agreed to by the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is sent if the record:

1. Is properly addressed or otherwise properly directed to an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record.

2. Is in a form that is capable of being processed by the information processing system described in paragraph 1 of this subsection.

3. Enters an information processing system that is outside the control of the sender or of a person that sent the electronic record on behalf of the sender or enters a region of the information processing system that is designated or used by the recipient and that is under the control of the recipient.

B. Unless otherwise agreed to by the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is received if the record:

1. Enters an information processing system that the recipient has designated or uses for the purpose of receiving electronic records or information of the type sent and from which the recipient is able to retrieve the electronic record.

2. Is in a form that is capable of being processed by the information processing system described in paragraph 1 of this subsection.

C. Subsection B applies even if the information processing system is located in a different place from the place the electronic record is deemed to be received pursuant to subsection D.

D. Unless otherwise expressly provided in the electronic record or agreed to by the sender and the recipient, an electronic record is deemed to be sent from the sender's place of business and to be received at the recipient's place of business.  If the sender or recipient has more than one place of business, the place of business of that person is the place that has the closest relationship to the underlying transaction.  If the sender or the recipient does not have a place of business, the place of business is the sender's or recipient's residence, as applicable.

E. An electronic record is received pursuant to subsection B even if no individual is aware of its receipt.

F. Receipt of an electronic acknowledgment from an information processing system described in subsection B establishes that a record was received but, by itself, does not establish that the content sent corresponds to the content received.

G. If a person is aware that an electronic record was purportedly sent as prescribed in subsection A or purportedly received as prescribed in subsection B, but was not actually sent or received, the legal effect of the sending or receipt is determined by other applicable law.  Except to the extent allowed by the other law, the parties may not agree to vary the requirements of this subsection.

 

#### Section 44-7016. Transferable records; definition

A. A person has control of a transferable record if a system employed for evidencing the transfer of interests in the transferable record reliably establishes that person as the person to which the transferable record was issued or transferred.

B. A system complies with subsection A and a person has control of a transferable record if the transferable record is created, stored and assigned in such a manner that all of the following are true:

1. A single authoritative copy of the transferable record exists that is unique, identifiable and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 of this subsection, unalterable.

2. The authoritative copy identifies the person asserting control as either:

(a) The person to which the transferable record was issued.

(b) If the authoritative copy indicates that the transferable record has been transferred, the person to which the transferable record was most recently transferred.

4. Copies or revisions that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the consent of the person asserting control.

5. Each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy.

6. Any revision of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as authorized or unauthorized.

C. Except as otherwise agreed, a person that has control of a transferable record is the holder as defined in section 47-1201 of the transferable record and has the same rights and defenses as a holder of an equivalent record or writing pursuant to title 47 including, if the applicable requirements under section 47-3302, subsection A or section 47-7501 or 47-9308 are satisfied, the rights and defenses of a holder in due course, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated or a purchaser, respectively.  Delivery, possession and indorsement are not required to obtain or exercise any of the rights under this subsection.

D. Except as otherwise agreed, an obligor under a transferable record has the same rights and defenses as an equivalent obligor under equivalent records or writings under title 47.

E. If requested by a person against which enforcement is sought, the person seeking to enforce the transferable record shall provide reasonable proof that the person is in control of the transferable record.  Proof may include access to the authoritative copy of the transferable record and related business records that are sufficient to review the terms of the transferable record and to establish the identity of the person that has control of the transferable record.

F. For the purposes of this section, "transferable record" means an electronic record that both:

1. Would be a note pursuant to title 47, chapter 3 or a document pursuant to title 47, chapter 7 if the electronic record were in writing.

2. The issuer has expressly agreed the electronic record is a transferable record.

## Chapter 27 - TOBACCO PRODUCT MANUFACTURERS ESCROW ACCOUNTS

### Article 1 - Model Statute

#### Section 44-7101. Tobacco product manufacturers escrow accounts; model statute

This state enacts the model statute described in the master settlement agreement entered into on November 23, 1998 between this state and certain United States tobacco product manufacturers as exhibit T as follows:

Findings and Purpose.

(a) Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the state and to the citizens of the state.  The surgeon general has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year.  These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking.

(b) Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for the state.  Under certain health-care programs, the state may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance.

(c) Under these programs, the state pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for these persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking.

(d) It is the policy of the state that financial burdens imposed on the state by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the state to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the state or are found culpable by the courts.

(e) On November 23, 1998, leading United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the "master settlement agreement," with the state. The master settlement agreement obligates these manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present and certain future claims against them as described therein, to pay substantial sums to the state (tied in part to their volume of sales); to fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and to make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.

(f) It would be contrary to the policy of the state if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the state to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.

Definitions.

(a) "Adjusted for inflation" means increased in accordance with the formula for inflation adjustment set forth in exhibit C to the master settlement agreement.

(b) "Affiliate" means a person who directly or indirectly owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with, another person.  Solely for purposes of this definition, the terms "owns," "is owned" and "ownership" mean ownership of an equity interest, or the equivalent thereof, of ten percent or more, and the term "person" means an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation or any other organization or group of persons.

(c) "Allocable share" means allocable share as that term is defined in the master settlement agreement.

(d) "Cigarette" means any product that contains nicotine, is intended to be burned or heated under ordinary conditions of use, and consists of or contains (1) any roll of tobacco wrapped in paper or in any substance not containing tobacco; or (2) tobacco, in any form, that is functional in the product, which, because of its appearance, the type of tobacco used in the filler, or its packaging and labeling, is likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as a cigarette; or (3) any roll of tobacco wrapped in any substance containing tobacco which, because of its appearance, the type of tobacco used in the filler, or its packaging and labeling, is likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as a cigarette described in clause (1) of this definition.  The term "cigarette" includes "roll-your-own" (i.e., any tobacco which, because of its appearance, type, packaging, or labeling is suitable for use and likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as tobacco for making cigarettes). For purposes of this definition of "cigarette," 0.09 ounces of "roll-your-own" tobacco shall constitute one individual "cigarette."

(e) "Master settlement agreement" means the settlement agreement (and related documents) entered into on November 23, 1998 by the state and leading United States tobacco product manufacturers.

(f) "Qualified escrow fund" means an escrow arrangement with a federally or state chartered financial institution having no affiliation with any tobacco product manufacturer and having assets of at least $1,000,000,000 where such arrangement requires that such financial institution hold the escrowed funds' principal for the benefit of releasing parties and prohibits the tobacco product manufacturer placing the funds into escrow from using, accessing or directing the use of the funds' principal except as consistent with section 3(B)(2) of this act.

(g) "Released claims" means released claims as that term is defined in the master settlement agreement.

(h) "Releasing parties" means releasing parties as that term is defined in the master settlement agreement.

(i) "Tobacco product manufacturer" means an entity that after the date of enactment of this act directly (and not exclusively through any affiliate):

(1) Manufactures cigarettes anywhere that such manufacturer intends to be sold in the United States, including cigarettes intended to be sold in the United States through an importer (except where such importer is an original participating manufacturer (as that term is defined in the master settlement agreement) that will be responsible for the payments under the master settlement agreement with respect to such cigarettes as a result of the provisions of subsection II(MM) of the master settlement agreement and that pays the taxes specified in subsection II(Z) of the master settlement agreement, and provided that the manufacturer of such cigarettes does not market or advertise such cigarettes in the United States);

(2) Is the first purchaser anywhere for resale in the United States of cigarettes manufactured anywhere that the manufacturer does not intend to be sold in the United States; or

(3) Becomes a successor of an entity described in paragraph (1) or (2).

(2) A nonparticipating manufacturer shall include in its certification (i) a list of all of its brand families and the number of units sold for each brand family that were sold in the state during the preceding calendar year, (ii) a list of all of its brand families that have been sold in the state at any time during the current calendar year, (iii) indicating by an asterisk, any brand family sold in the state during the preceding calendar year that is no longer being sold in the state as of the date of the certification and (iv) identifying by name and address any other manufacturer of the brand families in the preceding or current calendar year and (v) for each of the current calendar year and the preceding calendar year, a list of all of this state's resident and nonresident distributors that the manufacturer sold cigarettes to or that the manufacturer believes or has reason to believe purchased or received any of the manufacturer's cigarettes from another source. The nonparticipating manufacturer must execute and deliver a supplemental certification to the attorney general to request any addition to or modification of its brand families. The supplemental certification requesting the addition or modification does not relieve the brand families from the prohibitions set forth in sections 3(c) and 6(d) until the request is approved by the attorney general and the addition or modification to the brand families is listed or made in the directory.

(3) In the case of a nonparticipating manufacturer, the certification shall further certify:

(e) Unless the nonparticipating manufacturer or its affiliate is licensed as a tobacco distributor in this state, that all sales or shipments made by the nonparticipating manufacturer or its affiliate within or into this state are made to a tobacco distributor that is licensed in this state.

(f) All other information and materials specifically requested by this section or the attorney general in the course of enforcing this section.

(4) A tobacco product manufacturer may not include a brand family in its certification unless (i) in the case of a participating manufacturer, the participating manufacturer affirms that the brand family is to be deemed to be its cigarettes for purposes of calculating its payments under the master settlement agreement for the relevant year, in the volume and shares determined pursuant to the master settlement agreement, and (ii) in the case of a nonparticipating manufacturer, the nonparticipating manufacturer affirms that the brand family is to be deemed to be its cigarettes for purposes of section 44-7101, section 3(b).  Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or otherwise affecting the state's right to maintain that a brand family constitutes cigarettes of a different tobacco product manufacturer for purposes of calculating payments under the master settlement agreement or for purposes of section 44-7101.

(5) Tobacco product manufacturers shall maintain all invoices and documentation of sales and other information relied upon for the certification for a period of five years, unless otherwise required by law to maintain them for a greater period of time.

(6) A tobacco product manufacturer that is not currently listed in the directory must submit an initial certification subject to the same requirements and review process set forth in this article for annual certifications. The tobacco product manufacturers brand families remain subject to the prohibitions set forth in sections 3(c) and 6(d) until listed in the directory.

(b) Directory of cigarettes approved for stamping and sale.  Not later than ninety days after the effective date of this article, the attorney general shall develop and publish on the attorney general's web site a directory listing all tobacco product manufacturers that have provided current and accurate certifications conforming to the requirements of section 3(a) and all brand families that are listed in those certifications (the "directory"), except as noted below.

(1) The attorney general shall not include or retain in the directory the name or brand families of any nonparticipating manufacturer that fails to provide the required certification or whose certification the attorney general determines is not in compliance with any term of this article, unless the attorney general has determined that the violation has been cured to the satisfaction of the attorney general.

(2) Neither a tobacco product manufacturer nor brand family shall be included or retained in the directory if the attorney general concludes, in the case of a nonparticipating manufacturer, that (i) any escrow payment required pursuant to section 44-7101, section 3(b) for any period for any brand family, whether or not listed by the nonparticipating manufacturer, has not been fully paid into a qualified escrow fund governed by a qualified escrow agreement that has been approved by the attorney general, or (ii) any outstanding final judgment, including interest thereon, for a violation of section 44-7101 has not been fully satisfied for the brand family or the manufacturer.

(3) The attorney general shall update the directory as necessary in order to correct mistakes and to add or remove a tobacco product manufacturer or brand family to keep the directory in conformity with the requirements of this article.

(4) A distributor that has lawfully affixed stamps to cigarettes and subsequently is unable to sell those cigarettes lawfully because the cigarettes have been removed from the directory pursuant to section 3(b)(2) of this article, may apply to the department for a refund of the cost of such stamps.

(5) Every distributor shall provide and update as necessary an electronic mail address to the director and attorney general for the purpose of receiving any notifications as may be required by this article.

(6) A tobacco product manufacturer included in the directory may request that a new brand family be added to the directory by executing and delivering a supplemental certification with the necessary information to the attorney general and the director.  Not later than forty-five business days after receiving such a request, and at such earlier time as is reasonable to do so, the attorney general shall either (i) certify the new brand family or (ii) deny the request. However, in cases where the attorney general reasonably determines that it needs additional information to ascertain whether the requestor is the tobacco product manufacturer of the new brand family, the attorney general may take whatever additional time is reasonably needed to process the request, to locate and assemble information or documents needed to process the request, and to notify persons or agencies affected by the request.

(c) Prohibition against stamping or sale of cigarettes not in the directory. It shall be unlawful for any person (1) to affix a stamp to a package or other container of cigarettes of a tobacco product manufacturer or brand family not included in the directory or (2) to sell, offer or possess for sale, in this state, including for sale within or outside of this state, cigarettes of a tobacco product manufacturer or brand family not included in the directory.

(d) Every nonparticipating manufacturer shall post a bond for the exclusive benefit of this state.

(e) The bond shall be posted at least ten days in advance of each calendar quarter as a condition to the nonparticipating manufacturer and its brand families being included in the state directory for that quarter.

(f) If a nonparticipating manufacturer that posted a bond has failed to make or have made on its behalf deposits equal to the full amount owed for a quarter within fifteen days following the due date of the quarter under section 5, subparagraph (g), the state may execute on the bond in the amount equal to any remaining amount of the escrow due. Amounts that the state collects on a bond shall be deposited into the state treasury and shall reduce the amount of escrow due from that nonparticipating manufacturer in the dollar amount collected.  Escrow obligations above the amount collected on the bond remain due from that nonparticipating manufacturer and, as provided in any joint and several provision in this section, from the importers that sold its cigarettes during that calendar quarter.

Failure to comply with this subparagraph is grounds for removal from the directory.  For the purposes of this subparagraph, "importer" has the same meaning as in 27 Code of Federal Regulations 11 (2012). The importer declaration must be submitted as part of the initial, annual and supplemental certifications required by this article.

(i) The attorney general shall have the authority to not retain or refuse to include in the directory any nonparticipating manufacturer or the manufacturer's brand families, that (i) does not certify that it is subject to the enforcement of section 44-7101, this section and section 36-798.06 without any immunity, (ii) provides incorrect, false or misleading statements in any certification submitted to this state pursuant to section 44-7101 or this section with regard to any year or (iii) was previously or is currently not in compliance with any other federal or state laws, including another state's qualifying statute as defined in the master settlement agreement or if the attorney general has reason to believe that the tobacco product manufacturer will not comply with the laws.

(c) Any nonparticipating manufacturer whose cigarettes are sold in this state and who has not appointed and engaged an agent as herein required shall be deemed to have appointed the secretary of state as the agent and may be proceeded against in courts of this state by service of process upon the secretary of state; provided, however, that the appointment of the secretary of state as the agent shall not satisfy the condition precedent to having the brand families of the nonparticipating manufacturer included or retained in the directory.

(c) If a tobacco product manufacturer required to establish a qualified escrow fund under section 44-7101, section 3(b) disputes the attorney general's determination of the amount that the manufacturer is required to deposit into escrow and the attorney general determines that the dispute can likely be resolved by information contained in reports submitted by distributors to the department indicating sales or purchases of the manufacturer's cigarettes, then the attorney general shall produce the relevant portions of the reports to the manufacturer. However, before disclosing the foregoing information, the attorney general may require the manufacturer to provide all records related to its sales of the cigarettes in dispute. The disclosure provided by the attorney general to a tobacco product manufacturer pursuant to this subsection shall be limited to information concerning the cigarettes alleged by the state to be subject to the requirements of section 44-7101, section 3(b), may be used by the manufacturer only for the limited purpose of determining the appropriate escrow deposit, and may not be disclosed by the manufacturer to any third parties.
