The distribution board consists of two members elected at large from each new county plus the chairman of the county formation commission who shall act ex officio as the chairman of the board with the power to vote. The elective members shall be elected by nonpartisan ballot at the general election for the election of county officers pursuant to section 11-140. The names of candidates shall be placed on the general election ballot by petition pursuant to section 16-341 as it applies to county officers. The two candidates receiving the most votes in each new county are elected. If for any reason two members are not elected from a new county, the board of supervisors of the new county shall appoint a member or members as necessary so that the new county has two representatives on the distribution board. Elective members of the distribution board are entitled to compensation for their services determined pursuant to section 38-611. The chairman of the distribution board is entitled to compensation for services determined pursuant to section 11-136, subsection A. The distribution board is established and exists for two years beginning January 1 following the election of county officers pursuant to section 11-140 and terminating for all purposes from and after December 31 of the second calendar year following that election. The term of office for elective members and the chairman is for the duration of the distribution board's existence.

Elective county officers of the new counties shall provide the distribution board with necessary information and assistance to enable the distribution board to carry out its responsibilities under this section.

B. In the final annual budget of the affected county adopted pursuant to title 42, chapter 17, article 3, the board of supervisors shall include an amount for the operation of the distribution board during its first year of operation including legal, appraisal, survey and other costs. When collected, that amount shall be segregated and paid to the distribution board on the date of its organization. Taxes and federal, state and all other monies payable to the affected county after its termination and monies in the affected county's treasury shall be paid to the distribution board which shall account for the monies received according to their source. The distribution board shall pay all monies collected to the respective new county from or on behalf of which the monies were collected.

C. The distribution board shall annually estimate an amount to be levied as a tax on all the taxable property in the district to pay the distribution board's costs of administration and operation and to compensate any new county for property and other assets to which it is entitled under the terms of the transfer, division and apportionment of property as prescribed by the commission but which cannot be physically conveyed to the new county. On or before June 30 each year the distribution board shall certify to the board of supervisors of each new county the amount of taxes necessary to be levied for these purposes, and the board of supervisors shall levy and cause that amount to be collected as secondary taxes at the same time and in the same manner as levying and collecting general county taxes. The money so collected shall be paid to the distribution board which shall account for and expend the monies according to the purposes prescribed by this section. Any amounts remaining in the operating account of the distribution board on the date of its termination shall be paid to the new counties in proportion to their respective assessed valuation. Any amounts collectible by the distribution board on the date of its termination shall be collected by the respective new county in which they were assessed and paid to the state treasurer. The state treasurer shall hold these monies in trust for and pay them monthly to the respective new county on behalf of which they were collected according to the records of the distribution board.

D. The distribution board shall:

1. Establish a method to divide, apportion and assign to the respective new counties the liability for payment of any amounts which come due on account of:

(a) Bonds or other indebtedness of the affected county or counties which are outstanding or authorized when the affected county or counties are terminated.

(b) Other contracts and obligations, including employee compensation, of the affected county or counties.

(c) Indebtedness, contracts and other obligations of the distribution board.

2. Transfer, divide and apportion between the new counties all real and personal property and cash accounts of the affected county or counties as prescribed by the commission, compensating any new county for property which cannot be physically conveyed.

E. All records of an affected county shall, on its termination, be immediately transferred to the possession and custody of the distribution board. As soon as practicable the distribution board shall divide and transfer these records to the respective new county as appropriate. The records which would or should have been made in a new county, if it had been organized at the time of making the records, shall be transferred to that new county. The distribution board shall allow access to and inspection and transcription of county records by any person otherwise authorized by law to inspect or transcribe the particular records. If a transcript is made and properly verified and deposited, it has the same validity and effect as the original.

F. Before the distribution board is terminated the auditor general shall audit all of the distribution board's records and transmit the results of the audit to the board of supervisors of each new county and to the legislature. The costs of this audit shall be included in the distribution board's final budget and paid from the final tax levy for the distribution board.

A. After the formation of new counties is approved pursuant to the election held under section 11-137 the commission shall act to resolve disagreements involving terminating and transferring the affairs of the affected county or counties, community college, school districts and special taxing districts and actions of the distribution board and may hear disputes, render opinions and issue orders. Pending an appeal, an opinion or order of the commission has the same legal effect with respect to the county officers and state officials as an attorney general opinion has with respect to state officers and agencies.

B. A person aggrieved by a determination, opinion or order of the commission made pursuant to any provision of this article may appeal to the supreme court, and the hearing and determination of the appeal shall be given a priority.

C. The commission shall complete its work not later than December 31 of the second year following the organization of the new county or counties, from and after which date the commission is terminated.

#### Section 11-145. Payment of costs of county formation

All costs of the secretary of state and of the commission under this article are charges against the affected county or counties before their termination and against the new counties after their organization. Costs which can be identified with a specific county shall be charged against that county, but otherwise the costs shall be apportioned between the counties according to their respective assessed valuations.

B. All claims for payment shall be made through the secretary of state to the department of administration. Each month the department of administration shall certify the amounts of the claims to the state treasurer and the treasurer shall withhold and pay the amounts from the monies otherwise payable to the respective counties under section 42-5029, except that the amount withheld shall not exceed one-half of the amount payable to the county in any month.

A. Any county with a population between one million and two million persons may purchase, construct or operate a sewage system, including the collection, transportation, pumping, treatment and disposal of sewage, and charge fees and levy taxes therefor, if the county secures the assent by resolution of the governing bodies of those incorporated cities and towns representing not less than one-half of the population of the county before purchase, construction or operation of a sewage system.

If the owner does not reside on the property, the notice shall be sent to the last known address.

E. The unpaid sewage system user fees, from the date of recording in the office of the county recorder in the county in which the property is located, are a lien on the property until the fees are paid. The lien is subject and inferior to the lien for general taxes and to all prior recorded mortgages and encumbrances of record. A sale of the property to satisfy a lien obtained under this section shall be made on judgment of foreclosure and order of sale. A county may bring an action to enforce the lien in the superior court in the county in which the property is located at any time after the recording, but failure to enforce the lien by this action does not affect its validity. The recorded unpaid sewage system user fees are prima facie evidence of the truth of all matters recited in the recording and of the regularity of all proceedings before the recording.

F. Unpaid sewage system user fees pursuant to this section accrue interest at the rate prescribed by section 44-1201.

G. A prior assessment of unpaid sewage system user fees for the purposes provided in this section does not bar a subsequent assessment for these purposes and any number of liens on the same lot or tract of land may be enforced in the same action.

H. Subsection C of this section does not apply to residential property occupied by a lessee where the lessee is responsible for payment of the sewage system user fees. The county shall determine the status of leased residential property before filing the lien.

F. Bonds may be sold to natural persons residing in this state by negotiated sale on terms the board of supervisors considers to be the best available.  The bonds may bear interest payable at times determined by the board of supervisors.

#### Section 11-377. Form of bonds; interest rates; redemption; payment of principal and interest; additional security; definition

A. Bonds issued under this article shall be fully negotiable within the meaning and for all purposes provided by title 47. They may be in one or more series, may bear such dates, may be payable in such medium of payment and at such places, may carry such registration privileges, may have that priority or lien position between bondholders, shall be executed in such manner, may contain such other terms, covenants and conditions, and may be in such form as the board of supervisors by resolution prescribes.

B. Any or all of the bonds may be sold by calling for bids at public sale, through an on-line bidding process, under an accelerated bidding process or by negotiated sale. If sold under an accelerated bidding process, the bonds shall be sold at the lowest cost the board of supervisors deems then available after having received at least three pricing quotations from recognized purchasers of bonds of the type being sold. If sold at public sale or through an on-line bidding process, the bonds shall be sold to the bidder making the best bid.  If bonds are sold through an on-line bidding process, bids for the bonds that are entered into the system may be concealed until a specified time or disclosed in the on-line bidding process, may be subject to improvement in favor of the county before a specified time and may be for an entire issue or specified maturities according to the manner, terms and notice provisions ordered by the board of supervisors.

If an issue of bonds is sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount plus interest to be paid on the bonds must not exceed the amount of interest that would be payable on the bonds over the maturity schedule prescribed by the board of supervisors at the maximum rate set out in the resolution calling the election at which the bonds were voted.

D. If sold at public sale, the board of supervisors shall call for bids for the bonds by giving notice thereof at least once a week for two successive weeks within a county having a population of five hundred thousand persons or more, and once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within a county having a population of less than five hundred thousand persons. The notice shall be in the form prescribed by the board of supervisors. The bids shall be for the entire bond issue unless the board of supervisors by resolution allows bidding therefor in parcels of less than the entire issue.

E. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, bonds may be sold to natural persons residing in this state by negotiated sale on terms the board of supervisors deems to be the best then available and may bear interest payable at times determined by the board of supervisors. The bonds may be sold below, at or above par, provided that if the bonds are sold below par, the aggregate amount of discount plus interest to be paid on the bonds must not exceed the amount of interest that would be payable on the bonds over the maturity schedule prescribed by the board of supervisors at the maximum rate set out in the resolution calling the election at which the bonds were voted.

F. Bonds issued by a county may bear interest at any rate or rates not in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election, payable at the times determined by the board of supervisors, provided that each such bond may be evidenced by one instrument, or if commercial paper, by a succession of instruments each bearing interest payable only at maturity. Bonds or commercial paper issued under this article are subject to the following:

1. The bonds may bear interest at a fixed, variable or combination rate, none of which exceeds the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election.

2. A variable rate shall be based on any objective measure of the current value of money borrowed such as the announced prime rate of a bank, the rates borne by obligations of the United States or an index or other formula provided for by the board of supervisors. The board of supervisors shall employ a recognized agent in municipal bonds to market and remarket the bonds or commercial paper issued and to establish an interest rate in accordance with the approved index or formula.

3. The board of supervisors may grant to the owner of any bond a right to tender or may require the tender of the bond for payment or purchase at one or more times before maturity and may enter into appropriate agreements with any bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company for the purchase of bonds so tendered. This agreement may provide that while the bonds are held by the bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company the bonds may bear interest at a rate higher than when the bonds are held by other owners, but not in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election.

4. If bonds are tendered before maturity under an agreement to pay for or purchase bonds when so tendered, the county may provide for the purchase and resale of those bonds pursuant to the tenders without extinguishing the obligation represented by them or incurring a new obligation on the resale, whether or not those bonds are represented by the same instruments when purchased as when resold.

5. Compensation for the resale of the bonds shall not be based on or measured by the difference between the price at which the bonds are purchased and the price at which the bonds are resold.

6. The board of supervisors may:

(a)&#8194;&#8194;Contract with a bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company to provide additional security for the bonds in the form of a line of credit, letter of credit, insurance policy or other security.

(b)&#8194;&#8194;Pay the costs of this additional security from amounts provided in the bond issue or from other available sources and may enter into reimbursement obligations in connection with the cost of the additional security.

7. Any reimbursement obligation entered into with the bank, financial institution, insurance company or indemnity company shall not provide for the payment of interest in excess of the maximum rate of interest set forth in the resolution calling the election. The reimbursement obligation does not constitute a general obligation of the county and is payable from the same source as the bonds, or from other available revenues, as determined by the board of supervisors.

8. Variable rate bonds and commercial paper may be sold at competitive public sale, through an on-line bidding process or at negotiated sale. A competitive public sale may be accomplished pursuant to a notice of sale published at the times and in the manner provided in subsection D. This notice shall provide the terms and conditions determined by the board of supervisors.

9. If bonds are to be issued in the form of commercial paper, the board of supervisors shall first provide for the establishment of the schedule for the maturities of the bonds within the maximum period permitted by the voted proposition. The individual instruments representing the bonds may mature over shorter periods and may be retired with proceeds of subsequent instruments or with the proceeds of definitive bonds, but they shall be finally paid according to the schedule of bond maturities or earlier.

10. Bonds issued in the form of commercial paper may be sold through an agent in the form of instruments that mature at intervals the agent determines to be most advantageous to the issuer after giving public notice to potential investors as determined by the board of supervisors.

11. Bonds may be issued as compound interest bonds bearing interest payable only at maturity but compounded periodically until that date at a fixed rate no higher than the rate set forth in the resolution calling the election.

G. Pending preparation of the definitive bonds, interim receipts or certificates may be issued to the purchaser of the bonds in such form and with such provisions as the board of supervisors prescribes.

H. The principal of and interest on the bonds shall be payable primarily from the proceeds of revenues derived from taxes, fees, charges and other monies collected by the state and returned to such counties for street and highway purposes pursuant to the law.

I. As additional security for the payment of such bonds, a county, by resolution submitted to the qualified electors at a special election called for such purpose, and on the approval of such resolution by a majority of the voters voting at such election, may pledge its full faith and credit for the payment of the bonds, and if such pledge is made, and the revenues pledged to the payment of such bonds are at any time insufficient therefor, the county shall be obligated to pay such bonds with interest to the same extent as other general obligation bonds of the county, and shall be reimbursed from subsequent revenues received by the county from taxes, fees, charges and other monies collected by the state and returned to such county for street and highway purposes pursuant to law.

J. For purposes of this section, "on-line bidding process" means a procurement process in which the governing body receives bids electronically over the internet in a real-time, competitive bidding event.

 

#### Section 11-378. Issuance of bonds for public improvements; limitations of amount; successive borrowings; annual interest

A. No county may issue bonds under this article unless the aggregate amount of the revenues received by it from highway user taxes, including motor vehicle fuel taxes, and all other taxes, fees, charges or other monies returned to the county pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, in the year preceding the borrowing of money under this article is equal to at least one and one-half times the highest annual principal and interest requirements thereafter to come due on all such bonds to be outstanding after the borrowing occurs, provided that for bonds that are issued under this article where the aggregate amount of monies returned to the county pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, in the year preceding the borrowing of money under this article, is not equal to at least two times the highest annual principal and interest requirements thereafter to become due on all such bonds to be outstanding after the borrowing occurs, shall bear a rating at the time of issuance of "A" or better by at least one nationally recognized credit rating service taking into account any credit enhancement facility in effect with respect to those bonds. Subject to such limitation, successive borrowings may be made under this article.

B. In computing the annual interest requirements of bonds described in section 11-377, subsection F the board of supervisors shall determine a rate that is not more than the maximum rate permitted under the terms of their issuance. In making the determination, the board of supervisors shall set a rate that is not less than one hundred twenty-five per cent of the rate in effect on the date of determination or, if the bonds are not then issued, one hundred twenty-five per cent of the initial rate on the bonds, except that if this determination exceeds the maximum rate permitted under the terms of issuance, the rate shall be the maximum rate. Notwithstanding the provisions of any reimbursement obligation, the bonds remain outstanding until the stated maturity of the bonds.

#### Section 11-379. Expansion of pledge; effect on prior elections; refunding bonds; conflict of interest

A. All bonds issued pursuant to this article, whether before or after October 24, 1981, shall be paid from, and may hereafter be secured by a pledge of, all revenues received by the county issuing the bonds, from taxes, fees, charges and other monies collected by the state and returned to such county for street and highway purposes pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107.

B. Whenever the board of supervisors of any county determines that the best interests of such county will be served by the issuance of refunding bonds in order to refund bonds secured by the pledge of revenues received pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, the board of supervisors may issue refunding bonds on behalf of the county to refund the bonds theretofore issued pursuant to this article. Such refunding bonds shall be payable at such dates and in such amounts as the board of supervisors by resolution may decide, shall be secured by a pledge of all monies received pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, shall bear interest at a rate of not to exceed nine per cent, and in all other respects the form and character of the refunding bonds shall conform with the provisions of section 11-377. The refunding bonds may be sold at public or private sale at the price the board of supervisors deems to be the best price available therefor, which price may be below, at or above par, or the refunding bonds may be exchanged for a like amount of bonds being refunded, with all unmatured coupons attached thereto, or the refunding bonds or proceeds from the sale of the refunded bonds may be exchanged for a sufficient amount of cash to pay all legal, financial and all other expenses incurred by the county in the issuance of the bonds plus obligations issued by or guaranteed by the United States of America, which obligations with interest thereon will provide sufficient monies to pay, when due or called for prior redemption at the option of the county, all refunded bonds and the coupons appertaining thereto and any redemption premiums, if applicable. The board of supervisors may provide that any securities acquired from refunded bond proceeds or from exchange of the refunding bonds for the United States government securities be delivered to a bank or trust company doing business in this state to act as trustee or escrow agent to protect the rights of the holders of the refunded bonds.  The board of supervisors may execute such trust or escrow agreements as it sees fit to protect the rights of the holders of the refunded bonds and may also pay the fees, costs and expenses of such trustee or escrow agent and also all legal, financial paying agent's fees or charges and all other costs incidental to the issuance of the refunding bonds, either from refunding bond proceeds or from monies received pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107.

C. Notwithstanding title 38, chapter 3, article 8 or any other law, it shall not be a conflict of interest for the holder of any bond authorized by this article, or for a person contracting with the issuing county to purchase any such bond, to offer to sell or exchange, to contract to sell or exchange, or to sell or exchange any federal government securities or obligations to the county to be used for the purposes set forth in subsection B of this section, nor shall it be a conflict of interest for any trustee, escrow agent or paying agent to purchase for the trustee, escrow agent or paying agent account or for the account of another any bond issued under authority of this article.

#### Section 11-380. Separate fund to pay interest and principal on maturing installment

After any indebtedness is incurred under the provisions of this article, the treasurer of the county, during each year such indebtedness continues, shall set aside in a separate fund from the revenues received during such year from highway user taxes, including motor vehicle fuel taxes, and all other taxes, fees, charges or other monies returned to the county pursuant to title 28, chapter 18, article 2 and section 42-6107, an amount sufficient to pay the interest and principal upon the installment on such indebtedness next maturing.

If the board authorizes the establishment of a home detention program, a county sheriff may establish the program. A prisoner who is placed under the program established pursuant to this subsection shall bear the cost of all testing, monitoring and enrollment in alcohol or substance abuse programs unless, after determining the inability of the prisoner to pay the cost, the court assesses a lesser amount. The county shall use the collected monies to offset operational costs of the program.

L. A county sheriff may establish a continuous alcohol monitoring program for persons who are sentenced to jail confinement pursuant to section 28-1381 or 28-1382, which shall be treated the same as confinement in jail and shall fulfill the sheriff's duty to take charge of and keep the county jail and prisoners. A prisoner who is placed under a continuous alcohol monitoring program established pursuant to this subsection shall bear the cost of all testing, monitoring and enrollment in the program and pay thirty dollars per month while in the program, unless, after determining the inability of the prisoner to pay the cost, the court assesses a lesser amount. The county shall use the collected monies to offset operational costs of the program.

M. If a county sheriff establishes a home detention or continuous alcohol monitoring program under subsection K or L of this section, a prisoner must meet the following eligibility requirements for the program:

1. Subsection B of this section applies in determining eligibility for the program.

2. If the prisoner is sentenced under section 28-1381, subsection I, the prisoner first serves a minimum of one day in jail.

(d) Prohibition of association with any individual determined to be detrimental to the prisoner's successful participation in the program.

(e) All other provisions of the sentence imposed.

5. Any additional eligibility criteria that the county may impose.

N. If a county sheriff establishes a home detention program under subsection K of this section, the court, on placing the prisoner in the program, shall require electronic monitoring in the prisoner's home and, if consecutive hours of jail time are ordered, shall require the prisoner to remain at home during the consecutive hours ordered. The detention device shall constantly monitor the prisoner's location to ensure that the prisoner does not leave the premises.  Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to waive the minimum jail confinement requirements under subsection M, paragraph 2 of this section.

O. The court may terminate a prisoner's participation in the home detention or continuous alcohol monitoring program and require the prisoner to complete the remaining term of the jail sentence by jail confinement if either:

1. The prisoner fails to successfully complete a court ordered alcohol or drug screening, counseling, education and treatment program pursuant to subsection M, paragraph 4, subdivision (c) of this section or section 28-1381, subsection J or L.

2. If placed under home detention, the prisoner leaves the premises during a time that the prisoner is ordered to be on the premises without permission of the court or supervising authority.

P. At any other time the court may terminate a prisoner's participation in the home detention or continuous alcohol monitoring program and require the prisoner to complete the remaining term of the jail sentence by jail confinement.

Q. The sheriff may terminate a program established pursuant to this section at any time.

A. Notwithstanding any other law, a county authorized to operate a sewage system pursuant to section 11-264 may construct or improve a wastewater treatment facility or nonpoint source project with monies borrowed from or financial assistance provided by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona.

B. To repay financial assistance from the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona a county may enter into a financial assistance loan repayment agreement with the authority. A financial assistance loan repayment agreement is payable from any revenues otherwise authorized by law to be used to pay long-term obligations. If revenue from a property tax assessment is the designated source of repayment under the agreement, the property tax assessed and levied is a secondary property tax levy for purposes of article IX, Constitution of Arizona.

C. The county board of supervisors shall submit the question of entering and performing a financial assistance loan repayment agreement to the qualified electors voting at a regular or special general election in the county, except that if revenue from a secondary property tax levy is the designated source of repayment or if the project is constructed with an improvement district, the question shall be submitted to the qualified electors at an election held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November. Otherwise, an election is not required if voter approval has previously been obtained for substantially the same project with another funding source. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on the question:

1. Approves, the board of supervisors may execute, deliver and perform the financial assistance loan repayment agreement.

2. Disapproves, the board of supervisors shall not execute a financial assistance loan repayment agreement.

D. Payments made pursuant to a financial assistance loan repayment agreement are not subject to section 42-17106.

E. A financial assistance loan repayment agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall contain the covenants and conditions pertaining to the construction of a wastewater treatment facility or nonpoint source project and repayment of the loan as the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona deems proper.  Financial assistance loan repayment agreements may provide for the payment of interest on the unpaid principal balance of such agreement at the rates established in the agreement. The agreement may also provide for payment of the county's proportionate share of the expenses of administering the clean water revolving fund established by section 49-1221 and may provide that the county pay financing and loan administration fees approved by the water infrastructure finance authority. These costs may be included in the levy or assessment amounts pledged to repay the financial assistance.  Counties are bound by and shall fully perform the loan repayment agreements, and the agreements are incontestable after the loan is funded by the water infrastructure finance authority of Arizona.  The county shall also agree to pay the authority's costs in issuing bonds or otherwise borrowing to fund a loan.

F. A financial assistance loan repayment agreement under this section does not create a debt of the county, and the authority shall not require that payment of a financial assistance loan agreement be made from other than those sources permitted in subsection B of this section.

G. A county may employ attorneys, accountants, financial consultants and such other experts in their field as deemed necessary to perform services with respect to the financial assistance loan repayment agreement.

H. This section is supplemental and alternative to any other law under which a county may borrow money or issue bonds. This section shall not be construed as the exclusive authorization to enter into loan agreements with the authority.

I. A county may borrow additional monies or enter into additional financial assistance loan repayment agreements with the water infrastructure finance authority in an amount up to the amount approved by the voters pursuant to subsection C of this section less the amount that the county is already obligated to repay to the water infrastructure finance authority pursuant to a financial assistance loan repayment agreement.

On receipt of the application the board shall submit the application to the commission for a report.  Before reporting to the board, the commission shall hold at least one public hearing after giving at least fifteen days' notice of the hearing by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county seat and by posting of the area included in the proposed rezoning.  If the matter to be considered applies to territory in a high noise or accident potential zone as defined in section 28-8461, the notice shall include a general statement that the matter applies to property located in the high noise or accident potential zone.  The posting shall be in no less than two places with at least one notice for each quarter mile of frontage along perimeter public rights-of-way so that the notices are visible from the nearest public right-of-way.  The commission shall also send notice by first class mail to each real property owner as shown on the last assessment of the property within three hundred feet of the proposed rezoning and each county and municipality that is contiguous to the area of the proposed rezoning.  In proceedings involving rezoning of land that is located within territory in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military facility as defined in section 28-8461, the commission shall send copies of the notice of public hearing by first class mail to the military airport.  The notice sent by mail shall include, at a minimum, the date, time and place of the hearing on the proposed rezoning including a general explanation of the matter to be considered and a general description of the area of the proposed rezoning.  For those counties with five or more supervisors, the notice must include a general description of how the real property owners within the zoning area may file approvals or protests of the proposed rezoning, and notification that if twenty per cent of the property owners by area and number within the zoning area file protests, an affirmative vote of three-fourths of all members of the board will be required to approve the rezoning.  In proceedings that are initiated by the commission involving rezoning, notice by first class mail shall be sent to each real property owner, as shown on the last assessment of the property, of the area to be rezoned and all property owners, as shown on the last assessment of the property, within three hundred feet of the property to be rezoned.

E. If the commission or hearing officer has held a public hearing, the board may adopt the recommendations of the commission or hearing officer through use of a consent calendar without holding a second public hearing if there is no objection, request for public hearing or other protest.  If there is an objection, a request for public hearing or a protest, the board shall hold a public hearing at least fifteen days' notice of which shall be given by one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county seat and by posting the area included in the proposed rezoning.  In counties with territory in the vicinity of a military airport or ancillary military facility as defined in section 28-8461, the board shall hold a public hearing if, after notice is mailed to the military airport pursuant to subsection D of this section and before the public hearing, the military airport provides comments or analysis concerning the compatibility of the proposed rezoning with the high noise or accident potential generated by military airport or ancillary military facility operations that may have an adverse impact on public health and safety, and the board shall consider and analyze the comments or analysis before making a final determination.  After holding the hearing the board may adopt the rezoning by a majority vote of the board for those counties with fewer than five supervisors, or for those counties with five or more supervisors if a protest has not been filed.  If twenty per cent of the owners of property by area and number within the zoning area file a protest to the proposed rezoning, the change shall not be made except by a three-fourths vote of all members of the board for those counties with five or more supervisors.  If any members of the board are unable to vote on the question because of a conflict of interest, the required number of votes for the passage of the question is three-fourths of the remaining membership of the board for those counties with five or more supervisors, except that the required number of votes in no event shall be less than a majority of the full membership of the board.  In calculating the owners by area, only that portion of a lot or parcel of record situated within three hundred feet of the property to be rezoned shall be included.  In calculating the owners by number or area, county property and public rights-of-way shall not be included.

F. The board of supervisors shall adopt by ordinance a citizen review process that applies to all rezoning and specific zoning plan applications that require a public hearing.  The citizen review process shall include at least the following requirements:

1. Adjacent landowners and other potentially affected citizens will be notified of the application.

2. The county will inform adjacent landowners and other potentially affected citizens of the substance of the proposed rezoning.

3. Adjacent landowners and other potentially affected citizens will be provided an opportunity to express any issues or concerns that they may have with the proposed rezoning before the public hearing.

G. The rezoning or subdivision plat of any unincorporated area completely surrounded by a city or town shall use as a guideline the adopted general plan and standards as prescribed in the subdivision and zoning ordinances of the city or town after April 10, 1986.

H. The board or commission, before taking any action on a rezoning or subdivision plat in an area as prescribed in subsection G of this section, may require the affected city or town to supply information to allow the county to meet the guideline.  If an affected city or town objects to any such proposed action the board or commission shall prescribe in the minutes of the meeting specific reasons why in its opinion the guideline is actually being followed or why it is not practicable to follow the guideline of the general plan.

I. The board may approve a change of zone conditioned on a schedule for development of the specific use or uses for which rezoning is requested. If at the expiration of this period the property has not been improved for the use for which it was conditionally approved, the board after notification by certified mail to the owner and applicant who requested the rezoning shall schedule a public hearing to grant an extension, determine compliance with the schedule for development or cause the property to revert to its former zoning classification.

J. The legislature finds that a rezoning of land that changes the zoning classification of the land or that restricts the use or reduces the value of the land is a matter of statewide concern.  Such a change in zoning that is initiated by the governing body or zoning body shall not be made without the express written consent of the property owner.  In applying an open space element or a growth element of a comprehensive plan, a parcel of land shall not be rezoned for open space, recreation, conservation or agriculture unless the owner of the land consents to the rezoning in writing. For the purposes of this subsection, rezoning does not include the creation or expansion of overlay zones solely for the purpose of implementing airport safety and protection.  Rezoning also does not include the redesignation of areas of the county to which the residential provisions of the county building codes apply or do not apply.  The county shall not adopt any change in a zoning classification to circumvent the purpose of this subsection.

K. Notwithstanding title 19, chapter 1, article 4, a decision by the governing body involving rezoning of land that is not owned by the county and that changes the zoning classification of the land may not be enacted as an emergency measure and such a change shall not be effective for at least thirty days after final approval of the change in classification by the board.  Unless a resident files a written objection with the board of supervisors, the rezoning may be enacted as an emergency measure that becomes effective immediately by a four-fifths majority vote of the board for those counties with five or more supervisors or a two-thirds majority vote of the board for those counties with fewer than five supervisors.

L. For the purposes of this section, "zoning area" means the area within three hundred feet of the proposed amendment or change.

 

#### Section 11-815. Enforcement; county zoning inspector; deputies; building permits; violations; classification; civil penalties; hearing officers and procedures

A. The county zoning ordinance shall provide for its enforcement within a zoned territory by means of withholding building permits, and for those purposes may establish the position of county zoning inspector and deputy inspectors as may be required, who shall be appointed by the board.

B. After the establishment and filling of the position, it is unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, alter or use any building or other structure within a zoning district covered by the ordinance without first obtaining a building permit from the inspector and for that purpose the applicant shall provide the zoning inspector with a sketch of the proposed construction containing sufficient information for the enforcement of the zoning ordinance.  A permit is not required for repairs or improvements of a value not exceeding five hundred dollars.  Reasonable fees may be charged for the issuance of a permit. The inspector shall recognize the limitations placed on the inspector's authority by sections 11-804 and 11-811, and shall issue the permit when it appears that the proposed erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration or use fully conforms to the zoning ordinance.  In any other case the inspector shall withhold the permit.

C. It is unlawful to erect, construct, reconstruct, maintain or use any land in any zoning district in violation of any regulation or any ordinance pertaining to the land and any violation constitutes a public nuisance.  Any person, firm or corporation violating an ordinance, or any part of an ordinance, is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor. Each day during which the illegal erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, maintenance or use continues is a separate offense.

D. A county may establish civil penalties for a violation of any zoning regulation or ordinance. Civil penalties shall not exceed the amount of the maximum fine for a class 2 misdemeanor. Each day of continuance of the violation constitutes a separate violation. If an alleged violator is served with a notice of violation pursuant to subsection E of this section, the alleged violator is not subject to a criminal charge arising out of the same facts.

E. A county that establishes a civil penalty for a violation of a zoning regulation or ordinance may appoint hearing officers to hear and determine zoning violations. If the zoning inspector reports a zoning violation to the hearing officer, the hearing officer shall hold a hearing after notice of the hearing has been served on the alleged violator. The zoning inspector shall cause the notice to be personally served on the alleged violator at least five days before the hearing.  Personal service may be made by a zoning inspector or by any person authorized to perform personal service by the Arizona rules of civil procedure.  If it is impracticable for the zoning inspector to cause the notice to be personally served, the notice may be served in the same manner prescribed for alternative methods of service by the Arizona rules of civil procedure.  A notice served on the alleged violator other than by personal service shall be served at least thirty days before the hearing.  For the purposes of this subsection, "impracticable" includes service of the notice outside the boundaries of the county or in situations in which the hearing officer reasonably determines that personal service on the alleged violator would jeopardize the safety of the zoning inspector or other persons authorized to perform personal service by the Arizona rules of civil procedure.

F. At the hearing, the zoning inspector shall present evidence showing the existence of a zoning violation and the alleged violator or the alleged violator's attorney or other designated representative shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence. The county attorney may present evidence on behalf of the zoning inspector. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall determine whether a zoning violation exists and, if a violation is found to exist, may impose civil penalties pursuant to subsection D of this section.

G. A hearing officer may be an employee of the county and shall be appointed by the board of supervisors. A review of decisions of the hearing officer by the board of supervisors shall be available to any party to the hearing.  The board of supervisors may delegate this review to a county board of adjustment.  If the board of supervisors elects to delegate this review, the board of supervisors shall delegate all requested reviews to the board of adjustment.  The board of supervisors shall adopt written rules of procedure for the hearing and review of hearings, which shall be adopted in the same manner as zoning ordinances.  Judicial review of the final decisions of the board of supervisors or a board of adjustment shall be pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.  A county that establishes civil penalties for a violation of a zoning regulation or ordinance is not precluded from pursuing the remedies as provided for in subsection H of this section.

H. If any building or structure is or is proposed to be erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, maintained or used or any land is or is proposed to be used in violation of this chapter or any ordinance, regulation or provision enacted or adopted by the board under the authority granted by this chapter, the board, the county attorney, the inspector or any adjacent or neighboring property owner who is specially damaged by the violation, in addition to the other remedies provided by law, may institute injunction, mandamus, abatement or any other appropriate action or proceedings to prevent, abate or remove the unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, maintenance or use.

#### Section 11-816. Boards of adjustment; powers; appeals

A. There shall be one or more boards of adjustment in each county.  The board of supervisors may establish one board of adjustment that has jurisdiction countywide and that is composed of one member who is a resident of each supervisorial district or one board of adjustment in each supervisorial district that has jurisdiction in that supervisorial district and that is composed of not less than three nor more than five members, each of whom is a resident of that supervisorial district.  The members of each board shall be appointed for staggered terms of four years each.

B. The board of adjustment may:

1. Interpret the zoning ordinance if the meaning of any word, phrase or section is in doubt, if there is dispute between the appellant and enforcing officer or if the location of a district boundary is in doubt.

2. Allow a variance from the terms of the ordinance if, owing to peculiar conditions, a strict interpretation would work an unnecessary hardship and if in granting the variance the general intent and purposes of the zoning ordinance will be preserved.

3. If authorized by the board of supervisors, review decisions by a hearing officer who hears and determines zoning violations pursuant to section 11-815 and render a final decision. Subsections C and D of this section do not apply to this paragraph.  Judicial review of the final decision by the board of adjustment shall be pursuant to title 12, chapter 7, article 6.

C. Appeals to a board of adjustment may be taken by any person who feels that there is error or doubt in the interpretation of the ordinance or that due to unusual circumstances attaching to the person's property an unnecessary hardship is being inflicted on the person.  The appeal shall state whether it is a plea for an interpretation or a variance and the grounds for the appeal.

D. Any person aggrieved in any manner by an action of a board of adjustment may appeal within thirty days to the superior court, and the matter shall be heard de novo.

 

#### Section 11-817. Transfer of development rights; definitions

A. The board of supervisors may establish procedures, methods and standards for the transfer of development rights within its jurisdiction.  Any proposed transfer of all or any portion of the development rights of a sending property to a receiving property is subject to the written approval and consent of the property owners of both the sending property and the receiving property. A county may not condition a change of zone on a property owner's consent to or other participation in a proposed transfer of development rights, except that a change of zone may be required to implement a development agreement if it is voluntarily entered into by a property owner or owners with a county for the transfer of development rights concurrently with the county's approval of the change of zone.  Before any transfer of development rights, a county shall adopt an ordinance providing for:

1. The establishment, execution and recordation of instruments to sever development rights transferred from the sending property and to affix the development rights to the receiving property.  The instruments shall be executed by the property owners of the sending and receiving property and any lienholders.

2. The preservation of the characteristics of the sending property lending to the transfer of development rights and assurance that any of the prohibitions against particular uses or development of the sending property determined to be necessary to preserve the characteristics shall bind the property owner and every successor in interest to the property.

3. A delay before transfer of development rights to a receiving property after the severance of transferable development rights from a sending property.

4. The purchase, sale, exchange or other conveyance of transferable development rights before the rights are affixed to a receiving property.

5. Procedures for monitoring the severance, ownership and transfer of transferable development rights.

6. Appropriate public participation procedures for each type of transaction.

7. Use of development agreements as an option for implementation.

B. The resulting density or intensity of land use of the receiving property shall conform to the adopted comprehensive plan, as amended, if applicable.  If a plan amendment is required before the transfer, the plan amendment shall not be considered a major plan amendment.

C. A county's area of jurisdiction includes land in a high noise or accident potential zone, in order to facilitate development in the high noise or accident potential zone that conforms to the compatible uses prescribed in section 28-8481, subsection J, the county may approve the transfer of development rights and enter into intergovernmental agreements with any city or town or other county.

D. The board of supervisors may authorize the transfer of development rights from unincorporated areas of a county to a municipality pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement.

1. "Ancillary military facility" has the same meaning prescribed in section 28-8461.

2. "Development rights" means the maximum development that would be allowed on the sending property under the adopted comprehensive plan, the specific plan, if any, or the zoning ordinance, whichever provides greater density or intensity of use or, if applicable, both, in effect on the date the county adopts an ordinance pursuant to subsection A of this section, respecting the permissible use, area, bulk or height of improvements made to one or more lots or parcels.  Development rights may be calculated and allocated pursuant to factors including dwelling units, area, floor area, floor area ratio, height limitations, traffic generation or any other criteria that will quantify a value for the development rights in a manner that will carry out the objectives of this section.

3. "High noise or accident potential zone" has the same meaning prescribed in section 28-8461.

4. "Military airport" has the same meaning prescribed in section 28-8461.

5. "Receiving property" means one or more lots or parcels within which development rights are increased under the adopted comprehensive plan, the specific plan, if any, or the zoning ordinance, whichever provides greater density or intensity of use or, if applicable, both, in effect before a transfer of development rights and an amendment to the adopted comprehensive plan, specific plan or zoning ordinance, or a rezone of the property, whichever is required to implement the increase in development rights.  The receiving property shall be suitable for development that includes the transferred development rights consistent with the adopted comprehensive plan, as amended, if applicable.  Receiving property does not include lots or parcels that are partially or wholly located within, or that include, a high noise or accident potential zone of a military airport or an ancillary military facility.

6. "Sending property" means one or more lots or parcels that are partially or wholly located within, or that include, a high noise or accident potential zone of a military airport or an ancillary military facility, a floodplain, natural habitat, geologic features, recreation area or parkland, or land that has unique aesthetic, architectural or historic value, that a county determines is appropriate and necessary to restrict against particular uses or future development that would impair or preclude preservation of the characteristic or characteristics of the property or to protect the public because of health or safety concerns.

7. "Transfer of development rights" means the process by which development rights from one or more sending properties are affixed to one or more receiving properties.

A. The county board of supervisors shall regulate the subdivision of all lands within its corporate limits, except subdivisions that are regulated by municipalities.

B. The commission shall recommend to the board and the board shall adopt general regulations of uniform application governing plats and subdivisions of land within its area of jurisdiction. The regulations adopted shall secure and provide for the proper arrangement of streets or other highways in relation to existing or planned streets, highways or bicycle facilities or to the official map for adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, drainage, access of firefighting apparatus, recreation, light and air. The board may adopt general regulations to provide for the proper arrangement of hiking and equestrian trails in relation to existing or planned streets or highways, and if adopted, the hiking and equestrian trails shall conform to the official map for adequate and convenient open spaces for traffic, utilities, drainage, access of firefighting apparatus, recreation, light and air.  The general regulations may provide for modification by the commission in planned area development or specific cases where unusual topographical or other exceptional conditions may require such action.  The regulations shall include provisions as to the extent to which streets and other highways shall be graded and improved and to which water, sewer or other utility mains, piping or other facilities shall be installed or provided for on the plat as a condition precedent to the approval of the final plat.

C. Boards of supervisors of counties shall prepare specifications and make orders, inspections, examinations and certificates as may be necessary to protect and complete the provisions and make them effective. The regulations shall require the posting of performance bonds, assurances or such other security as may be appropriate and necessary to ensure the installation of required street, sewer, electric and water utilities, drainage, flood control and improvements meeting established minimum standards of design and construction.

D. Before adoption of regulations by the board or any amendment as provided in this article, the commission shall hold a public hearing.  The commission shall certify a copy of the regulations to the county board of supervisors, which shall hold a public hearing after notice of the time and place has been given by one publication fifteen days before the public hearing in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.

E. A board of supervisors may require by ordinance that land areas within a subdivision be reserved for parks, recreational facilities, school sites and fire stations subject to the following conditions:

1. The requirement may only be made on preliminary plats filed at least thirty days after the adoption of a comprehensive plan or amendment of the plan affecting the land area to be reserved.

B. The ground of refusal or approval of any plat submitted, including citation of or reference to the rule or regulation violated by the plat, shall be stated on the record of the board.

C. Approval of a plat shall not be deemed to constitute or effect an acceptance by the county for designation of any street, highway, bicycle facility or other way or open space shown on the plat into the county maintenance system except for hiking and equestrian trails that are constructed and maintained by the county.  However, at the time the streets, highways, bicycle facilities or other ways are fully completed in accordance with the approved plat and written specifications made by the county board, the county shall accept the streets, highways, bicycle facilities and other ways into the county maintenance system within one year of completion.

D. Any person causing a final plat to be recorded without first submitting the plat and obtaining approval of the board is guilty of a class 2 misdemeanor.  A county recorder shall not accept for recording or record any plat that has not been approved as provided by this article.

E. On recording of a plat, the fee of the streets, alleys, avenues, highways, easements, parks and other parcels of ground reserved to the use of the public vests in trust in the county for the uses and to the extent depicted on the plat, including ingress and egress easements depicted on the plat.  On annexation by any city or town the fee automatically vests in the city or town.

F. For any subdivision that consists of lots, tracts or parcels, each of which is of a size as prescribed by the board of supervisors, the board may waive the requirement to prepare, submit and receive approval of a preliminary plat as a condition precedent to submitting a final plat and may waive or reduce infrastructure standards or requirements except for improved dust-controlled access and minimum drainage improvements.

 

#### Section 11-823. Water supply; adequacy; exemptions

A. To protect the public health and safety, the general regulations adopted by the board pursuant to section 11-821, subsection B, if approved by unanimous vote of the board of supervisors, may provide that, except as provided in subsection C and subsection D, paragraph 1 of this section, the board shall not approve a final plat for a subdivision composed of subdivided lands, as defined in section 32-2101, located outside of an active management area, as defined in section 45-402, unless one of the following applies:

1. The director of water resources has determined that there is an adequate water supply for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108 and the subdivider has included the report with the plat.

2. The subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an adequate water supply by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-108.

B. If the board unanimously adopts the provision authorized by subsection A of this section:

1. The board may include in the general regulations an exemption from the provision for a subdivision that the director of water resources has determined will have an inadequate water supply because the water supply will be transported to the subdivision by motor vehicle or train if all of the following apply:

(a) The board determines that there is no feasible alternative water supply for the subdivision and that the transportation of water to the subdivision will not constitute a significant risk to the health and safety of the residents of the subdivision.

(b) If the water to be transported to the subdivision will be withdrawn or diverted in the service area of a municipal provider as defined in section 45-561, the municipal provider has consented to the withdrawal or diversion.

(c) If the water to be transported is groundwater, the transportation complies with the provisions governing the transportation of groundwater in title 45, chapter 2, article 8.

(d) The transportation of water to the subdivision meets any additional conditions imposed by the county.

2. The board shall promptly give written notice of the adoption of the provision to the director of water resources, the director of environmental quality and the state real estate commissioner.  The notice shall include a certified copy of the provision and any exemptions adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection.  Water providers may be eligible to receive monies in a water supply development fund, as otherwise provided by law.

3. The board shall not rescind the provision or amend it in a manner that is inconsistent with subsection A of this section. If the board amends the provision, it shall give written notice of the amendment to the director of water resources, the director of environmental quality and the state real estate commissioner.  The board may rescind an exemption adopted pursuant to paragraph 1 of this subsection.  If the board rescinds the exemption, it shall give written notice of the rescission to the director of water resources, the director of environmental quality and the state real estate commissioner, and the board shall not readopt the exemption for at least five years after the rescission becomes effective.

4. If the board approves a subdivision plat pursuant to subsection A, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section, the board shall note on the face of the plat that the director of water resources has reported that the subdivision has an adequate water supply or that the subdivider has obtained a commitment of water service for the proposed subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an adequate water supply pursuant to section 45-108.

5. If the board approves a subdivision plat pursuant to an exemption authorized by paragraph 1 of this subsection or granted by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-108.02 or 45-108.03:

(a) The board shall give written notice of the approval to the director of water resources and the director of environmental quality.

(b) The board shall include on the face of the plat a statement that the director of water resources has determined that the water supply for the subdivision is inadequate and a statement describing the exemption under which the plat was approved, including a statement that the board or the director of water resources, whichever applies, has determined that the specific conditions of the exemption were met.  If the director of water resources subsequently informs the board that the subdivision is being served by a water provider that has been designated by the director as having an adequate water supply pursuant to section 45-108, the board shall record in the county recorder's office a statement disclosing that fact.

C. Subsection A of this section does not apply to:

1. A proposed subdivision that the director of water resources has determined will have an inadequate water supply pursuant to section 45-108 if the director grants an exemption for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108.02 and the exemption has not expired or the director grants an exemption pursuant to section 45-108.03.

2. A proposed subdivision that received final plat approval from the county before the requirement for an adequate water supply became effective in the county if the plat has not been materially changed since it received the final plat approval.  If changes were made to the plat after the plat received the final plat approval, the director of water resources shall determine whether the changes are material pursuant to the rules adopted by the director to implement section 45-108.  If the county approves a plat pursuant to this paragraph and the director of water resources has determined that there is an inadequate water supply for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108, the county shall note this on the face of the plat.

D. If the subdivision is composed of subdivided lands as defined in section 32-2101 outside of an active management area and the board has not adopted a provision pursuant to subsection A of this section:

1. If the director of water resources has determined that there is an adequate water supply for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108 or if the subdivider has obtained a written commitment of water service for the subdivision from a city, town or private water company designated as having an adequate water supply by the director of water resources pursuant to section 45-108, the board shall note this on the face of the plat if the plat is approved.

2. If the director of water resources has determined that there is an inadequate water supply for the subdivision pursuant to section 45-108, the board shall note this on the face of the plat if the plat is approved.

 

### Article 4 - Land Divisions; Appeals; Moratorium

#### Section 11-831. Review of land divisions; definitions

A. The board of supervisors of each county may adopt ordinances and regulations pursuant to this section for staff review and approval of land divisions of five or fewer lots, parcels or fractional interests, any of which is ten acres or smaller in size.  The county may not deny approval of any land division that meets the requirements of this section.  If review of the request is not completed within thirty days after receiving the request, the land division is considered to be approved.  At its option, the board of supervisors may submit a ballot question to the voters of the county to allow the voters to determine the application of subsections B and C to qualifying land divisions in that county.

B. An application to split a parcel of land shall be approved if:

1. The lots, parcels or fractional interests each meet the minimum applicable county zoning requirements of the applicable zoning designation.

2. The applicant provides a standard preliminary title report or other acceptable document that demonstrates legal access to the lots, parcels or fractional interests.

3. The applicant provides a statement from a licensed surveyor or engineer, or other evidence acceptable to the county, stating whether each lot, parcel or fractional interest has physical access that is traversable by a two-wheel drive passenger motor vehicle.

4. The applicant reserves the necessary and appropriate utility easements to serve each lot, parcel or fractional interest created by the land division.

C. An application to split a parcel of land that does not comply with one or more of the items listed in subsection B shall still be approved if the applicant provides an acknowledgment that is signed by the applicant and that confirms that no building or use permit will be issued by the county until the lot, parcel or fractional interest has met the requirements of subsection B.  The county may grant a variance from one or more of the items listed in subsection B.

D. Any approval of a land division under this section may:

1. Include the minimum statutory requirements for legal and physical on-site access that must be met as a condition to the issuance of a building or use permit for the lots, parcels or fractional interests.

2. Identify topographic, hydrologic or other site constraints, requirements or limitations that must be addressed as conditions to the eventual issuance of a building or use permit.  These constraints, requirements or limitations may be as noted by the applicant or through county staff review, but there shall be no requirement for independent studies.

E. If the requirements of subsections A through D do not apply, a county may adopt ordinances and regulations pursuant to this chapter for staff review of land divisions of five or fewer lots, parcels or fractional interests but only to determine compliance with minimum applicable county zoning requirements and legal access and may grant waivers from the county zoning and legal access requirements.  The county may not deny approval of any land division that meets the requirements of this section or where the deficiencies are noticed in the deed.  A county may not require a public hearing on a request to divide five or fewer lots, parcels or fractional interests.  If review of the request is not completed within thirty days from receipt of the request, the land division shall be deemed approved.  If no legal access is available, the legal access does not allow access by emergency vehicles or the county zoning requirements are not met, the access or zoning deficiencies shall be noticed in the deed.  If a county by ordinance requires a legal access of more than twenty-four feet roadway width, the county is responsible for the improvement and maintenance of the improvement.  If the legal access does not allow access to the lots, parcels or fractional interests by emergency vehicles, neither the county nor its agents or employees are liable for damages resulting from the failure of emergency vehicles to reach the lot, parcel or fractional interest.

F. It is unlawful for a person or group of persons acting in concert to attempt to avoid this section or the subdivision laws of this state by acting in concert to divide a parcel of land into six or more lots or sell or lease six or more lots by using a series of owners or conveyances.  Either the county where the division occurred or the state real estate department pursuant to title 32, chapter 20, but not both, may enforce this prohibition. A familial relationship alone is not sufficient to constitute unlawful acting in concert.

G. For any subdivision that consists of ten or fewer lots, tracts or parcels, each of which is of a size as prescribed by the board of supervisors, the board of supervisors of each county may waive the requirement to prepare, submit and receive approval of a preliminary plat as a condition precedent to submitting a final plat and may waive or reduce infrastructure standards or requirements except for improved dust-controlled access and minimum drainage improvements.

H. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Legal access" means a public right of vehicular ingress and egress between the lots, parcels or fractional interests being created.

2. "Minimum applicable county zoning requirements" means the minimum acreage and dimensions of the resulting lot, parcel or fractional interest as required by the county's zoning ordinance.

3. "Utility easement" means an easement of eight feet in width dedicated to the general public to install, maintain and access sewer, electric, gas and water utilities.

 

#### Section 11-832. Appeals of county actions; dedication or exaction; excessive reduction in property value; burden of proof; attorney fees; compliance with court decisions

A. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a property owner may appeal the following actions relating to the owner's property by a county, or an administrative agency or official of a county, in the manner prescribed by this section:

1. The requirement by a county of a dedication or exaction as a condition of granting approval for the use, improvement or development of real property.  This section does not apply to a dedication or exaction that is required in a legislative act of the board of supervisors and that does not give discretion to an administrative agency or official to determine the nature or extent of the dedication or exaction.

2. The adoption or amendment of a zoning regulation by a county that creates a taking in violation of subsection I.

B. The county shall notify the property owner that the property owner has the right to appeal the county's action pursuant to this section and shall provide a description of the appeal procedure.  The county shall not request the property owner to waive the right of appeal or trial de novo at any time during the consideration of the property owner's request.

C. The appeal shall be in writing and filed with or mailed to a hearing officer designated by the board of supervisors within thirty days after the final action is taken.  The county shall submit a takings impact report to the hearing officer.  A fee shall not be charged for filing the appeal.

D. After receipt of an appeal, the hearing officer shall schedule a time for the appeal to be heard not later than thirty days after receipt.  The property owner shall be given at least ten days' notice of the time when the appeal will be heard unless the property owner agrees to a shorter time period.

E. In all proceedings under this section the county has the burden to establish that there is an essential nexus between the dedication or exaction and a legitimate governmental interest and that the proposed dedication, exaction or zoning regulation is roughly proportional to the impact of the proposed use, improvement or development or, in the case of a zoning regulation, that the zoning regulation does not create a taking of property in violation of subsection I.  If more than a single parcel is involved, this requirement applies to the entire property.

F. The hearing officer shall decide the appeal within five working days after the appeal is heard.  If the county does not meet its burden under subsection E, the hearing officer shall:

1. Modify or delete the requirement of the dedication or exaction appealed under subsection A, paragraph 1.

2. In the case of a zoning regulation appealed under subsection A, paragraph 2, the hearing officer shall transmit a recommendation to the board of supervisors.

G. If the hearing officer modifies or affirms the requirement of the dedication, exaction or zoning regulation, a property owner aggrieved by a decision of the hearing officer, at any time within thirty days after the hearing officer has rendered a decision, may file a complaint for a trial de novo in the superior court on the facts and the law regarding the issues of the condition or requirement of the dedication, exaction or zoning regulation.  Pursuant to the standards for granting preliminary injunctions, the court may exercise any legal or equitable interim remedies that will permit the property owner to proceed with the use, enjoyment and development of the real property but that will not render moot any decision upholding the dedication, exaction or zoning regulation.

H. All matters presented to the superior court pursuant to this section have preference on the court calendar on the same basis as condemnation matters, and the court may award reasonable attorney fees incurred in the appeal and trial pursuant to this section to the prevailing party.  The court may further award damages that are deemed appropriate to compensate the property owner for direct and actual delay damages on a finding that the county acted in bad faith.

I. A county or an agency or instrumentality of a county shall comply with the United States Supreme Court cases of Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374 (1994), Nollan v. California Coastal Commission, 483 U.S. 825 (1987), Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003 (1992), First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304 (1987), Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606 (2001), Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 320 (2002) and Arizona and federal appellate court decisions that are binding on Arizona counties interpreting or applying those cases.

 

#### Section 11-833. Standards for enactment of moratorium; land development; limitations; definitions

A. A county shall not adopt a moratorium on construction or land development unless it first:

1. Provides notice to the public published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the community at least thirty days before a final public hearing to be held to consider the adoption of the moratorium.

2. Makes written findings justifying the need for the moratorium in the manner provided for in this section.

3. Holds a public hearing on the adoption of the moratorium and the findings that support the moratorium.

B. For urban land or land subject to potential urbanization, a moratorium may be justified by demonstration of a need to prevent a shortage of essential public facilities that would otherwise occur during the effective period of the moratorium.  This demonstration shall be based on reasonably available information and shall include at least the following findings:

1. A showing of the extent of need beyond the estimated capacity of existing essential public facilities expected to result from new land development, including identification of any essential public facilities currently operating beyond capacity and the portion of this capacity already committed to development, or in the case of water resources, a showing that, in an active management area as defined in section 45-402, an assured water supply cannot be provided, or outside an active management area, a sufficient water supply cannot be provided, to the new land development, including identification of current water resources and the portion already committed to development.

2. That the moratorium is reasonably limited to those areas of the county where a shortage of essential public facilities would otherwise occur and on property that has not received development approvals based on the sufficiency of existing essential public facilities.

3. That the housing and economic development needs of the area affected have been accommodated as much as possible in any program for allocating any remaining essential public facility capacity.

C. A moratorium not based on a shortage of essential public facilities under subsection B of this section may be justified only by a demonstration of compelling need for other public facilities, including police and fire facilities. This demonstration shall be based on reasonably available information and shall include at least the following findings:

1. For urban land or land subject to potential urbanization:

(a) That application of existing development ordinances or regulations and other applicable law is inadequate to prevent irrevocable public harm from development in affected geographical areas.

(b) That the moratorium is sufficiently limited to ensure that a needed supply of affected housing types and the supply of commercial and industrial facilities within or in proximity to the county are not unreasonably restricted by the adoption of the moratorium.

(c) The reasons that alternative methods of achieving the objectives of the moratorium are unsatisfactory.

(d) That the county has determined that the public harm that would be caused by failure to impose a moratorium outweighs the adverse effects on other affected local governments, including shifts in demand for housing or economic development, public facilities and services and buildable lands and the overall impact of the moratorium on population distribution.

(e) That the city or town proposing the moratorium has developed a work plan and time schedule for achieving the objectives of the moratorium.

2. For rural land:

(a) That application of existing development ordinances or regulations and other applicable law is inadequate to prevent irrevocable public harm from development in affected geographical areas.

(b) The reasons that alternative methods of achieving the objectives of the moratorium are unsatisfactory.

(c) That the moratorium is sufficiently limited to ensure that lots or parcels outside the affected geographical areas are not unreasonably restricted by the adoption of the moratorium.

(d) That the county proposing the moratorium has developed a work plan and time schedule for achieving the objectives of the moratorium.

D. Any moratorium adopted pursuant to this section does not affect any express provision in a development agreement entered into pursuant to section 9-500.05 or as defined in section 11-1101 governing the rate, timing and sequencing of development, nor does it affect rights acquired pursuant to a protected development right granted according to chapter 9 of this title or title 9, chapter 11.  Any moratorium adopted pursuant to this section shall provide a procedure pursuant to which an individual landowner may apply for a waiver of the moratorium's applicability to its property by claiming rights obtained pursuant to a development agreement, a protected development right or any vested right or by providing the public facilities that are the subject of the moratorium at the landowner's cost.

E. A moratorium adopted under subsection C, paragraph 1 of this section shall not remain in effect for more than one hundred twenty days, but such a moratorium may be extended for additional periods of time of up to one hundred twenty days if the county adopting the moratorium holds a public hearing on the proposed extension and adopts written findings that:

1. Verify the problem requiring the need for the moratorium to be extended.

2. Demonstrate that reasonable progress is being made to alleviate the problem resulting in the moratorium.

3. Set a specific duration for the renewal of the moratorium.

F. A county considering an extension of a moratorium shall provide notice to the general public published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the community at least thirty days before a final hearing is held to consider an extension of a moratorium.

G. This section does not prevent a city or town from complying with any state or federal law, regulation or order issued in writing by a legally authorized governmental entity.

H. A landowner aggrieved by a county's adoption of a moratorium pursuant to this section, at any time within thirty days after the moratorium has been adopted, may file a complaint for a trial de novo in the superior court on the facts and the law regarding the moratorium. All matters presented to the superior court pursuant to this section have preference on the court calendar on the same basis as condemnation matters. The court may award reasonable attorney fees incurred in the appeal and trial pursuant to this section to the prevailing party.

I. For the purposes of this section:

1. "Compelling need" means a clear and imminent danger to the health and safety of the public.

2. "Essential public facilities" means water, sewer and street improvements and water resources to the extent that these improvements and water resources are provided by the county or private utility.

3. "Moratorium on construction or land development" means engaging in a pattern or practice of delaying or stopping issuance of permits, authorizations or approvals necessary for the subdivision and partitioning of, or construction on, any land.  It does not include denial or delay of permits or authorizations because they are inconsistent with applicable statutes, rules, zoning or other ordinances.

4. "Rural land" means all property in the unincorporated area of a county or in the incorporated area of the city or town with a population of two thousand nine hundred or less persons.

5. "Urban land or land subject to potential urbanization" means all property in the incorporated area of a city or town with a population of more than two thousand nine hundred persons.

6. "Vested right" means a right to develop property established by the expenditure of substantial sums of money pursuant to a permit or approval granted by the city, town or county.

 

### Article 5 - Building Codes

#### Section 11-861. Adoption of codes by reference; limitations; method of adoption; fire sprinklers; fire apparatus access roads or approved routes; intent; state preemption; fire watch requirements; pool barrier gates; refrigerants

A. In any county that has adopted zoning pursuant to this chapter, the board of supervisors may adopt and enforce, for the unincorporated areas of the county so zoned, a building code and other related codes to regulate the quality, type of material and workmanship of all aspects of construction of buildings or structures, except that the board may authorize that areas zoned rural or unclassified may be exempt from the provisions of the code adopted. The codes may be adopted by reference after notice and hearings before the county planning and zoning commission and board of supervisors as provided in this chapter for amendments to the zoning ordinance of the county.

B. The board of supervisors may adopt a fire prevention code in the unincorporated areas of the county in which a fire district has not adopted a nationally recognized fire code pursuant to section 48-805.  Any fire code adopted by a board of supervisors pursuant to this subsection shall remain in effect until a fire district is established and adopts a code applicable within the boundaries of the district.

C. For the purposes of this article, codes authorized by subsections A and B of this section shall be limited to the following:

1. Any building, electrical, plumbing or mechanical code that has been adopted by any national organization or association that is organized and conducted for the purpose of developing codes or that has been adopted by the largest city in that county. If the board of supervisors adopts a city code, it shall adopt, within ninety days after receiving a written notification of a change to the city code, the same change or shall terminate the adopted city code.

2. Any fire prevention code that has been adopted by a national organization or association organized or conducted for the purpose of developing fire prevention codes and that is as stringent as the state fire code adopted pursuant to section 37-1383.

D. The board of supervisors may adopt a current wildland-urban interface code. The code may be adapted from a model code adopted by a national or international organization or association for mitigating the hazard to life and property. The board must follow written public procedures in developing and adopting the code and any revisions to the code to provide effective, early and continuous public participation through:

1. The broad dissemination and publicity of the proposed code and any revisions to the code.

2. The opportunity for submission and consideration of written public comments.

3. Open discussions, communications programs and information services.

4. Consultation with federal agencies and state and local officials.

E. The board of supervisors shall not adopt a code or ordinance or part of a uniform code or ordinance that prohibits a person or entity from choosing to install or equip or not install or equip fire sprinklers in a single-family detached residence or any residential building that contains not more than two dwelling units.  The board of supervisors shall not impose any fine, penalty or other requirement on any person or entity for choosing to install or equip or not install or equip fire sprinklers in such a residence. This subsection does not apply to any code or ordinance that requires fire sprinklers in a residence and that was adopted before December 31, 2009. The provisions of this subsection shall be included on all fire sprinkler permit applications that are for a single-family detached residence or any residential building that contains not more than two dwelling units.

F. A fire sprinkler permit application may be in either print or electronic format.

G. A board of supervisors may not adopt any, or part of any, fire code, ordinance, stipulation or other legal requirement for an approved fire apparatus access road or a fire apparatus access road extension, or both, or an approved route or a route extension, or both, that directly or indirectly requires a one or two family residence or a utility or miscellaneous accessory building or structure to install fire sprinklers. A fire code official may increase or extend an approved fire apparatus access road or a fire apparatus access road extension, or both, or an approved route or a route extension, or both, to comply with this subsection. Compliance with this subsection is not grounds to deny or suspend a license or permit. This subsection may be enforced in a private civil action and relief, including an injunction, may be awarded against a county. The court shall award reasonable attorney fees, damages, lost opportunity costs, interest and the cost of the sprinkler system to a party that prevails in an action against a county for a violation of this subsection.  The legislature finds and determines that property rights are a matter of statewide concern and a fundamental element of freedom. A property owner's right to use the property owner's property must be protected from unreasonable abridgment by county regulation and enforcement. This subsection supersedes and preempts any regulation adopted by a county regarding an approved fire apparatus access road, fire apparatus access road extension, approved route or route extension.  For the purposes of this subsection:

1. "Fire code" includes the international fire code, however denominated.

2. "Utility or miscellaneous accessory building or structure" includes an agricultural building, aircraft hangar, accessory to a residence, barn, carport, fence that is more than six feet high, grain silo, greenhouse, livestock shelter, private garage, retaining wall, shed, stable, tank or tower.

H. If a fire code adopted by a board of supervisors requires the use of a fire watch, an employee who works at the building in which a fire watch is required may serve as the fire watch.  A person who is designated as a fire watch shall be equipped with means to contact the local fire department, and the person's only duty while keeping watch for fires shall be to perform constant patrols of the protected premises. The county shall provide the fire watch with printed instructions from the office of the state fire marshal and may provide a free training session before the person's deployment as the fire watch begins.  For the purposes of this subsection, "fire watch" means a person who is stationed in a building or in a place relative to a building to observe the building and its openings when the fire protection system for the building is temporarily nonoperational or absent.

I. From and after December 31, 2014, a code or ordinance or part of a uniform code or ordinance that is adopted by the board of supervisors applies to locking devices for pool barrier gates used for means of ingress or egress for semipublic swimming pools.  Any new construction or major renovation of a semipublic swimming pool from and after December 31, 2014 must meet the requirements of the code or ordinance or part of the uniform code or ordinance that is adopted by the board of supervisors.  This subsection does not apply to a locking device for a pool barrier gate used for means of ingress or egress for a semipublic swimming pool that was installed before January 1, 2015, if the locking device meets the requirements prescribed in section 36-1681, subsection B, paragraph 3.

J. Any code, ordinance or general or specific plan provision or part of a code, ordinance or general or specific plan provision adopted by a county may not prohibit the use of refrigerants that are listed as acceptable pursuant to the clean air act (69 Stat. 322; 42 United States Code section 7671k) if the equipment used is listed and installed in accordance with the use conditions prescribed in the clean air act.

#### Section 11-861.01. Single family residences; solar water heating requirement

A. Any code adopted pursuant to this article may contain a provision requiring new single family residences in the county to be designed to facilitate the future installation of solar water heating equipment.

B. The phrase "facilitate the future installation" as used in subsection A means to provide readily accessible piping to allow for pipe fittings that will allow future connection into the system of solar water heating equipment.

#### Section 11-862. Advisory board; appointment; terms; duties

A. Any code adopted pursuant to this article shall contain a provision for an advisory board consisting of at least five members in order to determine the suitability of alternative materials and construction and to permit interpretations of the provisions of such code. The advisory board shall consist of at least five but not more than seven members and shall include at least members from the following categories, to the extent the persons meeting the qualifications are available within the county and are residents of such county:

2. A professional engineer duly licensed in the state of Arizona.

3. A general contractor duly licensed in the state of Arizona.

4. A person representing the public and a resident of the county.

5. A person engaged in the electrical, mechanical or plumbing trade.

Vacancies shall be filled for an unexpired term in the manner in which original appointments are required to be made.

E. The functions and duties of the advisory board may be specified by regulation by the board of supervisors.

F. If the county and a city or town contract to provide for enforcement of codes pursuant to section 11-863, by intergovernmental agreement pursuant to chapter 7, article 3 of this title, the manner in which appointments are made to the advisory board may be specified in the agreement.

#### Section 11-864. Publication of ordinance adopting code

Any code authorized by this article may be enacted without setting forth in full the provisions, but the adopting ordinance shall be published in full. At least three paper copies or one paper copy and one electronic copy maintained in compliance with section 44-7041 of the code shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the board of supervisors or the county planning and zoning department and kept available for public use and inspection. A code enacted by reference may be amended in the same manner.

 

#### Section 11-865. Exemptions; exception

A. This article does not apply to:

1. Construction or operation incidental to construction and repair to irrigation and drainage ditches or appurtenances thereto, of regularly constituted districts or reclamation districts, or to farming, dairying, agriculture, viticulture, horticulture or stock or poultry raising, or clearing or other work on land in rural areas for fire prevention purposes.

(i) The costs incurred or monies advanced are credited against or reimbursed from the development fees otherwise due from a development.  The amount of credits issued shall equal the costs identified by the county in the infrastructure improvements plan associated with the construction of the necessary public services or facility expansions.  The county shall allow the owner to assign the credits from the development fees otherwise due from a development and any excess credits to other developments for the same category of necessary public services in the same service area.

(ii) The county reimburses the owner for those costs from the development fees paid from all developments that will use those necessary public services or facility expansions.  The county shall allow the owner to assign the reimbursement rights to other developments for the same category of necessary public services in the same service area.

8. Projected interest charges and other finance costs may be included in determining the amount of development fees only if the monies are used for the payment of principal and interest on the portion of the bonds, notes or other obligations issued to finance construction of necessary public services or facility expansions identified in the infrastructure improvements plan.

9. Monies received from development fees shall be placed in a separate fund and accounted for separately and may only be used for the purposes authorized by this section.  Monies received from development fees identified in an infrastructure improvements plan adopted or updated pursuant to subsection E of this section shall be used to provide the same category of necessary public services or facilities expansions for which the development fee was assessed and for the benefit of the same service area as defined in the infrastructure improvements plan in which the development fees were assessed. Interest earned on monies in the separate fund shall be credited to the fund.

10. The county shall prescribe the schedule for paying the development fees. Based on the costs identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, the county shall provide a credit toward the payment of the development fees for the required or agreed to dedication of public sites, improvements and other necessary public services or facility expansions included in the infrastructure improvements plan and for which development fees are assessed, to the extent the public sites, improvements and necessary public services or facility expansions are provided by the developer.  On request of the developer, instead of providing a credit toward the payment of development fees, the county shall provide for reimbursement from the development fees paid from all development that will use those public sites, improvements or necessary public services or facility expansions of the actual costs of the required or agreed to dedication of public sites, improvements or other necessary public services or facility expansions included in the infrastructure improvements plan and for which development fees are assessed, to the extent the public sites, improvements and necessary public services or facility expansions are provided by the developer.  The developer of residential dwelling units shall be required to pay the fees when construction permits for the dwelling units are issued, or at a later time if specified in the development agreement pursuant to section 11-1101. If a development agreement provides for development fees to be paid at a time later than the issuance of construction permits, the deferred development fees shall be paid not later than fifteen days after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy.  The development agreement shall provide for the value of any deferred development fees to be supported by an appropriate security, including a surety bond, letter of credit or cash bond.

11. If a county requires as a condition of development approval the construction or improvement of, contributions to or dedication of any facilities that were not included in a previously adopted infrastructure improvements plan, the county shall cause the infrastructure improvements plan to be amended to include the facilities and shall provide a credit toward the payment of development fees for the construction, improvement, contribution or dedication of the facilities to the extent that the facilities will substitute for or otherwise reduce the need for other similar facilities in the infrastructure improvements plan for which development fees were assessed. If a county requires as a condition of development approval the set aside of active or passive open space, the county shall issue a credit toward any development fees identified in the infrastructure improvements plan to fund any park facilities or facility expansion.  On request of the individual or entity seeking development approval, instead of issuing a credit toward the payment of development fees, the county shall provide for reimbursement from the development fees paid from all development that will use those facilities or facility expansions of the actual costs of the construction or improvement of, contributions to or dedication of the public facilities required as a condition of development approval.

12. The county shall forecast the contribution to be made in the future in cash, taxes, fees, assessments and all other sources of revenue derived from the property owner towards the capital costs of the necessary public service covered by the development fees.

13. If development fees are assessed against residential development, the county shall also assess development fees against commercial and industrial development.  The county may distinguish between different categories of residential, commercial and industrial development in assessing the costs to the county of providing necessary public services to new development and in determining the amount of the development fees applicable to the category, except that the county may not distinguish residential developments on the basis of the size of the dwelling unit or number of bedrooms.  If a county agrees to waive any of the development fees assessed on a development, the county shall reimburse the appropriate development fees accounts for the amount that was waived. The county shall provide notice of any such waiver to the advisory committee established pursuant to subsection I of this section.

14. In determining and assessing development fees applying to land in a community facilities district established under title 48, chapter 4, article 6, the county shall take into account all public infrastructure provided by the district and capital costs paid by the district for necessary public services and shall not assess a portion of the development fees based on the infrastructure or costs.

15. The county shall not assess or collect development fees from a school district or charter school, other than fees assessed or collected for streets and water and wastewater utility functions.

C. Before assessing development fees, the county shall:

1. Give at least thirty days' advance notice of intention to assess new or increased development fees.

2. Release to the public and post on the county's website a written report of the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan adopted pursuant to subsection E of this section.

3. Conduct a public hearing on the proposed development fees at any time after the expiration of the thirty-day notice of intention to assess development fees and at least thirty days before the scheduled date of adoption of the development fees.  Within sixty days after the date of the public hearing on the proposed development fees, the county shall approve or disapprove the imposition of the development fees.  A county may not adopt an ordinance, order or resolution approving development fees as an emergency measure.

D. Development fees assessed pursuant to this section are not effective for at least ninety days after formal adoption by the board of supervisors.

E. Before the adoption or amendment of development fees or amendment of the boundaries of a service area, the board of supervisors shall adopt or update the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan for the designated service area.  The county shall conduct a public hearing on the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan at least thirty days before the adoption or update of the infrastructure improvements plan.  The county shall release the infrastructure improvements plan to the public, post the infrastructure improvements plan on the county's website, including in the posting the land use assumptions, the time period of the projections, a description of the necessary public services included in the infrastructure improvements plan and a map of the service area to which the land use assumptions apply, make available to the public the documents used to prepare the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan and provide public notice at least sixty days before the public hearing, subject to the following:

1. The land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan shall be approved or disapproved within sixty days after the public hearing on the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan and at least thirty days before the public hearing on the report required by subsection C of this section.  A county may not adopt an ordinance, order or resolution approving the land use assumptions or infrastructure improvements plan as an emergency measure.

2. An infrastructure improvements plan shall be developed by qualified professionals using generally accepted engineering and planning practices pursuant to subsection F of this section.

3. A county shall update the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan at least every five years.  The initial five-year period begins on the day the infrastructure improvements plan is adopted.  The county shall review and evaluate the current land use assumptions and shall cause an update of the infrastructure improvements plan to be prepared pursuant to this section.

4. Within sixty days after completion of the updated land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan, the county shall schedule and provide notice of a public hearing to discuss and review the update and shall determine whether to amend the land use assumptions and infrastructure improvements plan.

5. A county shall hold a public hearing to discuss the proposed amendments to the land use assumptions, the infrastructure improvements plan or the development fees.  The land use assumptions and the infrastructure improvements plan, including the amount of any proposed changes to the development fees per service unit, shall be made available to the public on or before the date of the first publication of the notice of the hearing on the amendments.

6. The hearing procedures prescribed in paragraph 1 of this subsection apply to a hearing on the amendment of land use assumptions, an infrastructure improvements plan or development fees.  Within sixty days after the date of the public hearing on the amendments, a county shall approve or disapprove the amendments to the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fees.  A county may not adopt an ordinance, order or resolution approving the amended land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fees as an emergency measure.

7. The advisory committee established under subsection I of this section shall file its written comments on any proposed or updated land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development fees before the fifth business day before the date of the public hearing on the proposed or updated land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development fees.

8. If, at the time an update as prescribed in paragraph 3 of this subsection is required, the county determines that no changes to the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fees are needed, the county, as an alternative to the updating requirements of this subsection, may publish notice of the determination on the county's website that includes the following:

(a) A statement that the county has determined that no change to the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fees is necessary.

(b) A description and map of the service area in which an update has been determined to be unnecessary.

(c) A statement that by a specified date, which shall be at least sixty days after the date of publication of the first notice, a person may request to the county in writing that the county update the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fees.

(d) A statement identifying the person or entity to whom the written request for an update should be sent.

9. If, by the date specified pursuant to paragraph 8 of this subsection, a person requests in writing that the county update the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fees, the county shall cause, accept or reject an update of the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan or development fees to be prepared pursuant to this section.

10. Notwithstanding the notice and hearing requirements for adoption of an infrastructure improvements plan, the county may amend an infrastructure improvements plan without a public hearing if the amendment addresses only elements of necessary public services in the existing infrastructure improvements plan and the changes to the plan will not, individually or cumulatively with other amendments adopted pursuant to this subsection, increase the level of service in the service area or cause an increase in  development fees that is greater than five percent when new or modified development fees are assessed pursuant to this section.  The county shall provide notice of the amendment at least thirty days before adoption, shall post the amendment on the county's website and shall provide notice to the advisory committee established pursuant to subsection I of this section that the amendment complies with this subsection.

F. For each necessary public service that is the subject of development fees, the infrastructure improvements plan shall include:

1. A description of the existing necessary public services in the service area and the costs to upgrade, update, improve, expand, correct or replace those necessary public services to meet existing needs and usage and stricter safety, efficiency, environmental or regulatory standards. The description shall be prepared by qualified professionals who are licensed in this state, as applicable.

8. A forecast of revenues generated by new service units other than development fees, including estimated state shared revenue, highway user revenue, federal revenue, ad valorem property taxes, construction contracting or similar excise taxes and the capital recovery portion of utility fees attributable to development based on the approved land use assumptions, and a plan to include these contributions in determining the extent of the burden imposed by the development as required in subsection B, paragraph 12 of this section.

G. A county's infrastructure improvements plan may identify necessary public services or facility expansions that the county plans to construct beyond the time period provided for in subsection J, paragraph 3 of this section but may not include the costs of those necessary public services or facility expansions in the calculation of development fees.

H. A county's development fees ordinance shall provide:

1. That new development fees or an increased portion of modified development fees may not be assessed against a development for twenty-four months after the date that the county issues the final approval for a commercial, industrial or multifamily development or the date that the first building permit is issued for a residential development pursuant to an approved site plan or subdivision plat, only if subsequent changes are not made to the approved site plan or subdivision plat that would increase the number of service units. If the number of service units increases, the new or increased portion of modified development fees shall be limited to the amount attributable to the additional service units.  The period is not extended by a renewal or amendment of the site plan or the final subdivision plat that was the subject of the final approval.  The county shall issue, on request, a written statement of the development fees schedule applicable to the development.  If, after the date of the county's final approval of a development, the county reduces the development fees assessed on development, the reduced fees shall apply to the development.

2. A process for a development to request an alternative development fee calculation or change in category of development that appears on an adopted development fee schedule based on a projection that the actual burdens and costs associated with the county's provision of necessary public services or facility expansions to the development that are to be paid by development fees will differ substantially from those costs projected by the county or will be substantially less than the amount projected to be paid by development fees.  The county manager or the county manager's designee shall review the request and make a determination as to the development fee to be assessed.  The assessed development fee shall have a substantial nexus to the actual burdens and costs associated with providing the necessary public services or facility expansions to that development that are to be funded by development fees.  The determination of the county manager is appealable to the board of supervisors.

I. A county shall do one of the following:

1. Before the adoption of the proposed or updated land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development fees as prescribed in subsection E of this section, appoint an infrastructure improvements advisory committee, subject to the following requirements:

(a) The advisory committee shall be composed of at least five members who are appointed by the board of supervisors.  At least fifty percent of the members of the advisory committee must be representatives of the real estate, development or building industries, of which at least one member of the committee must be from the home building industry.  Members may not be employees or officials of the county.

(b) The advisory committee shall serve in an advisory capacity and shall:

(i) Advise the county in adopting land use assumptions and in determining whether the assumptions are in conformance with the general plan of the county.

(ii) Review the infrastructure improvements plan and file written comments.

(iii) Monitor and evaluate implementation of the infrastructure improvements plan.

(iv) Every year file reports with respect to the progress of the infrastructure improvements plan and the collection and expenditures of development fees and report to the county any perceived inequities in implementing the infrastructure improvements plan or assessing the development fees.

(v) Advise the county of the need to update or revise the land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development fees.

(c) The county shall make available to the advisory committee any professional reports with respect to developing and implementing the infrastructure improvements plan.

(d) The county shall adopt procedural rules for the advisory committee to follow in carrying out the advisory committee's duties.

2. Provide for a biennial certified audit of the county's land use assumptions, infrastructure improvements plan and development fees.  An audit pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted by one or more qualified professionals who are not employees or officials of the county and who did not prepare the infrastructure improvements plan.  The audit shall review the progress of the infrastructure improvements plan, including the collection and expenditures of development fees for each project in the infrastructure improvements plan, and evaluate any inequities in implementing the infrastructure improvements plan or imposing the development fees. The county shall post the findings of the audit on the county's website and shall conduct a public hearing on the audit within sixty days after the release of the audit to the public.

J. On written request, an owner of real property for which development fees have been paid after December 31, 2020 is entitled to a refund of the development fees or any part of the development fees if:

1. Pursuant to subsection B, paragraph 6 of this section, existing facilities are available and service is not provided.

2. The county, after collecting the fees to construct a facility when service is not available, has failed to complete construction within the time period identified in the infrastructure improvements plan, but in no event later than the time period specified in paragraph 3 of this subsection.

3. For development fees other than development fees for water or wastewater facilities, any part of the development fees is not spent as authorized by this section within ten years after the fees have been paid or, for development fees for water or wastewater facilities, any part of the development fees is not spent as authorized by this section within fifteen years after the development fees have been paid.

K. If the development fees were collected for the construction of all or a portion of a specific item of infrastructure, and on completion of the infrastructure the county determines that the actual cost of construction was less than the forecasted cost of construction on which the development fees were based and the difference between the actual and estimated cost is greater than ten percent, the current owner may receive a refund of the portion of the development fees equal to the difference between the development fees paid and the development fees that would have been due if the development fees had been calculated at the actual construction cost.

L. A refund shall include any interest earned by the county from the date of collection to the date of refund on the amount of the refunded fees. All refunds shall be paid to the owner of record of the property at the time the refund is paid.  If the development fees are paid by a governmental entity, the refund shall be paid to the governmental entity.

M. Development fees that were adopted before January 1, 2017 may continue to be assessed only to the extent that the development fees will be used to provide a necessary public service for which development fees can be assessed pursuant to this section and shall be replaced by development fees imposed under this section on or before January 1, 2021. Any county having development fees that have not been replaced under this section on or before January 1, 2021 may not collect development fees until the development fees have been replaced with fees that comply with this section.  Development fees adopted or amended by a county after January 1, 2017 shall comply with this section.  Any development fees monies collected before January 1, 2017 remaining in a development fees account:

1. Shall be used towards the same category of necessary public services as authorized by this section.

2. And collected for a purpose not authorized by this section shall be used for the purpose for which the development fees were collected on or before January 1, 2024, and after which, if not spent, shall be distributed equally among the categories of necessary public services authorized by this section.

N. A moratorium may not be placed on development for the sole purpose of awaiting completion of all or any part of the process necessary to develop, adopt or update development fees.

O. In any judicial action interpreting this section all powers conferred on a county by this section shall be narrowly construed to ensure that development fees are not used to impose on new residents a burden all taxpayers of a county should bear equally.

P. Each county that assesses development fees shall submit an annual report accounting for the collection and use of the fees for each service area.  The annual report shall include the following:

1. The amount assessed by the county for each type of development fee.

2. The balance of each fund maintained for each type of development fee assessed as of the beginning and end of the fiscal year.

3. The amount of interest or other earnings on the monies in each fund as of the end of the fiscal year.

4. The amount of development fee monies used to repay:

Q. Within ninety days following the end of each fiscal year, each county shall submit a copy of the annual report to the clerk of the board of supervisors and post the annual report on the county's website.  Copies shall be made available to the public on request.  The annual report may contain financial information that has not been audited.

R. A county that fails to file the report and post the annual report on the county's website as required by this section shall not collect development fees until the report is filed and posted.

S. Any action to collect development fees shall be commenced within two years after the obligation to pay the development fees accrues.

T. A county may continue to assess development fees adopted before January 1, 2017 for any facility that was financed before June 1, 2016 if:

1. Development fees were pledged to repay debt service obligations related to the construction of the facility.

2. After January 1, 2018, any development fees collected under this subsection are used solely for the payment of principal and interest on the portion of the bonds, notes or other debt service obligations issued before June 1, 2016 to finance construction of the facility.

U. Through January 1, 2018, development fees adopted before January 1, 2017 may be used to finance construction of a facility and may be pledged to repay debt service obligations if:

1. The facility that is being financed is a facility that is described under subsection V, paragraph 7, subdivision (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section.

## Chapter 9 - PROTECTED DEVELOPMENT RIGHTS

### Article 1 - General Provisions

#### Section 11-1201. Definitions

In this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires:

1. "Landowner" means any owner of a legal or equitable interest in real property, including the heirs, devisees, successors, assigns and personal representative of the owner, or a representative authorized by a landowner to submit to a county a development application for a property for approval.

2. "Property" means all real property subject to zoning regulations and restrictions by a county.

3. "Protected development right" means the right to undertake and complete the development and use of property under the terms and conditions of a protected development right plan established pursuant to this article, without compliance with subsequent changes in zoning regulations and development standards, except as provided by section 11-1204.

4. "Protected development right plan" means a plan submitted by a landowner to a county, which, if approved by the board of supervisors of the county and if identified as a protected development right plan at the time it is submitted, grants the landowner, for a specified period of time, a protected development right to undertake and complete the development as shown on the plan.  The protected development right plan shall be submitted to a county for site development approval. A protected development right plan for a phased development shall be in the form of a plan for a master plan development which may include a plan for a planned unit development, planned community development or district, planned residential development or district or planned area development or district if such land use category or district is recognized and provided for in the zoning ordinance of the county.  A protected development right plan for a nonphased development must provide the final site development approval needed for issuance of a building permit.

 

 

#### Section 11-1202. Protected development right; establishment; plan requirements; variance

A. A county may provide by ordinance or resolution the requirements for a development to be a phased development.  If a county does not adopt an ordinance or resolution that includes the requirements for a development to be a phased development, a plan submitted as a protected development right plan may be identified as a plan for a phased development plan at the time the plan is submitted.

B. A protected development right plan, at a minimum, shall describe with a reasonable degree of certainty all of the following:

1. The proposed uses of the site.

2. The boundaries of the site.

3. Significant topographical and other natural features affecting development of the site.

4. For other than a phased development, the general location on the site of the proposed buildings, structures and other improvements.

5. The number of dwelling units and, for other than a phased development, the square footage and height of the proposed buildings and other structures.

6. The location of all existing and proposed utilities and provision for other infrastructure on the site, including water, sewer, roads and pedestrian walkways.

C. Nothing in this section is intended to or shall preclude a county from establishing additional requirements for submittal or approval of development plans for any land use category or district and such requirements may include traffic reports or studies, drainage reports or studies, master street plans, development phasing schedules and phased public infrastructure schedules. A county shall require submission of a more detailed plan for each phase of a phased development in order to obtain final site development approval to develop the property.

D. A final subdivision plat which meets the requirements of subsection B, may be designated as a protected development right plan by ordinance or resolution of the board of supervisors upon a finding by the board of supervisors that grants a protected development right to undertake and complete the development shown on the final subdivision plat will promote reasonable certainty, stability and fairness in the land use planning and regulatory process and secure the reasonable investment backed expectations of the landowner.

E. A protected development right is established only for the specific elements of the development or other specific matters shown on the approved protected development right plan. A protected development right is not established for any elements or other matters, or portions of any elements of the development or other matters not shown on the approved protected development right plan.

F. The board of supervisors of a county may designate by ordinance or resolution a development plan that is not identified as a protected development right plan at the time it is submitted as a protected development right plan upon a finding by the board of supervisors that granting a protected development right to undertake and complete the development shown on the plan will promote reasonable certainty, stability and fairness in the land use planning and regulatory process and secure the reasonable investment backed expectations of the landowner.

G. A protected development right shall be deemed established with respect to a property on the effective date of a valid approval of a protected development right plan. The protected development right confers on the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of the property under the terms and conditions of the protected development right plan and this article.

H. A county shall not require a landowner to waive a protected development right as a condition of development approval.

I. A protected development right is subject to the terms and conditions imposed by the county on the protected development right plan approval.

J. A protected development right plan approved with a condition or stipulation that a variance be obtained does not confer a protected development right until the necessary variance is obtained. Approval of a protected development right plan does not guarantee approval of a variance.

 

 

#### Section 11-1203. Duration of a protected development right; termination

A. A protected development right established under a protected development right plan is valid for three years for a nonphased development, five years for a phased development and ten years for a phased development that contains at least one section of land as defined by 43 United States Code section 751 or has a gross acreage of more than six hundred forty acres.

B. A county may extend for a maximum of two additional years, ten years for a phased development that contains at least one section of land as defined by 43 United States Code section 751 or has a gross acreage of more than six hundred forty acres and thirty years for a phased development that has a gross acreage of more than one thousand six hundred acres, the duration of a protected development right obtained through approval of a protected development right plan, if a longer time period is warranted by all relevant circumstances, including the size, type and phasing of the development on the property, the level of investment of the landowner, economic cycles and market conditions. The decision to extend the time period for a protected development right is at the discretion of the county. However, a protected development right shall not remain established for more than five years for a nonphased development, seven years for a phased development, twenty years for a phased development that contains at least one section of land as defined by 43 United States Code section 751 or has a gross acreage of more than six hundred forty acres or forty years for a phased development that has a gross acreage of more than one thousand six hundred acres.

C. After the approval of a protected development right plan, the plan may be subject to subsequent reviews and approvals by the county to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval if the reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with the original approval. The county may revoke its approval of the protected development right plan for failure to comply with applicable terms and conditions imposed on the approval.

D. A protected development right terminates at the end of the applicable period established under this section. If a building permit has been issued before the date of termination of a protected development right, the protected development right remains valid until the building permit expires, but in no event for longer than one year. On expiration, only principal structures for which footings or foundations have been completed may be finished under the protected development right. On the expiration of a protected development right, development may continue based on a valid building permit and according to standards in effect at that time. An unexpired building permit issued for a property with a protected development right does not expire or shall not be revoked merely because a protected development right expires under the time limitations specified in this section.

 

#### Section 11-1204. Subsequent changes prohibited; exceptions

A. A protected development right established under this section precludes the enforcement against the property to which the protected development right applies of any legislative or administrative land use regulation by a county or pursuant to an initiated measure that would change, alter, impair, prevent, diminish, delay or otherwise impact the development or use of the property as set forth in an approved protected development right plan, except under any one or more of the following circumstances:

1. With the written consent of the affected landowner.

2. On findings, by ordinance or resolution and after notice and a public hearing, that natural or man-made hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the property, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare if the project were to proceed as approved in the protected development right plan.

3. On findings, by ordinance or resolution and after notice and a hearing, that the landowner or his representative intentionally supplied inaccurate information or made material misrepresentations that made a difference in the approval of the protected development right plan by the county.

4. On the enactment of a state or federal law or regulation that precludes development as approved in the protected development right plan, in which case the governing body of the county, after notice and a hearing, may modify the affected provisions, on a finding that the change in state or federal law has a fundamental effect on the protected development right plan.

B. A protected development right does not preclude the enforcement of a subsequently adopted overlay zoning classification that imposes additional requirements and that does not affect the allowable type or density of use, or ordinances or regulations that are general in nature and that are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the county, such as building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes.

C. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the establishment of a protected development right does not preclude, change or impair the authority of a county to adopt and enforce zoning ordinance provisions governing nonconforming property or uses.

D. This article does not alter or diminish the authority of a county to exercise its eminent domain powers.

#### Section 11-1205. Protected development right; exercise; agreements

A. A protected development right obtained under this chapter is not a personal right but attaches to and runs with the applicable property. After approval of a protected development right plan, all successors to the original landowner are entitled to exercise the protected development right.

B. Nothing in this article precludes judicial determination, based on common law principles or statutory provisions, that a vested right exists in a particular case or that a compensable taking has occurred. Except as expressly provided in this chapter, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to alter the existing common law of vested rights.

C. Nothing in this article shall preclude, change, or limit the ability of a county to enter into a development agreement as defined in section 11-1101.

#### Section 11-1206. Protected development right; agreements regarding public safety

Notwithstanding any other law, a county, for public safety purposes and with the written consent of the owner of property which has been granted a protected development right pursuant to section 11-1202 or the owner of any other residential or commercial development subject to the supervision of the county under this title, by resolution or ordinance may provide for:

1. The application and enforcement of speed limits, weight restrictions or other safety measures on a private roadway that is located within any development in the unincorporated areas of the county and that is open to and used by the public provided that a county may require payment from the property owner prior to installation for the actual cost of signs which are required to provide notice of any speed limitation or other restriction which applies on the private roadway.

2. The approval of an extension or addition to any roadway which has been or may be designated as a primitive road pursuant to section 28-6706, provided that any extension or addition is made to connect the primitive road with a road or highway serving a development and the total length of the extension or addition does not exceed one mile. Upon completion of the extension or addition as authorized by this section the entire road may be designated as a primitive road pursuant to section 28-6706 as long as the existing portion of the road qualifies to be so designated pursuant to section 28-6706.

A. For any new ordinance or code requiring a license, a county shall have in place an overall time frame during which the county will either grant or deny each type of license that it issues.  The overall time frame for each type of license shall state separately the administrative completeness review time frame and the substantive review time frame and shall be posted on the county's website or the website of an association of counties if the county does not have a website.

B. On or before December 31, 2012, a county that issues licenses required under existing ordinances or codes shall have in place an overall time frame during which the county will either grant or deny each type of license that it issues. The overall time frame for each type of license shall state separately the administrative completeness review time frame and the substantive review time frame and shall be posted on the county's website or the website of an association of counties if the county does not have a website. Counties shall prioritize the establishment of time frames for those licenses that have the greatest impact on the public.

C. In establishing time frames, counties shall consider all of the following:

1. The complexity of the licensing subject matter.

2. The resources of the county.

3. The economic impact of delay on the regulated community.

4. The impact of the licensing decision on public health and safety.

5. The possible use of volunteers with expertise in the subject matter area.

D. A county shall issue a written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies to an applicant for a license within the administrative completeness review time frame. If the permit sought requires approval of more than one department of the county, each department may issue a written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies.

E. If a county determines that an application for a license is not administratively complete, the county shall include a comprehensive list of the specific deficiencies in the written or electronic notice provided pursuant to subsection D of this section. If the county issues a written or electronic notice of deficiencies within the administrative completeness time frame, the administrative completeness review time frame and the overall time frame are suspended from the date the notice is issued until the date that the county receives the missing information from the applicant. The county may issue an additional written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies based on the applicant's submission of missing information. If the permit sought requires approval of more than one department of the county, each department may issue an additional written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies based on the applicant's submission of missing information.

F. If a county does not issue a written or electronic notice of administrative completeness or deficiencies within the administrative completeness review time frame, the application is deemed administratively complete. If a county issues a timely written or electronic notice of deficiencies, an application shall not be complete until all requested information has been received by the county. A county may consider an application withdrawn if, by fifteen days or more after the date of notice, as established by the county, the applicant does not supply the documentation or information requested or an explanation of why the information cannot be provided within the established time period.

G. During the substantive review time frame, a county may make one comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections. If the county identifies legal requirements that were not included in the comprehensive request for corrections, the county may amend the comprehensive request for corrections once to include the legal requirements and the legal authority for the requirements. If the permit sought requires approval of more than one department of the county, each department may issue a comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections.  If the applicant fails to resolve an issue identified in a request for corrections, the county may make supplemental written or electronic requests for corrections that are limited to issues previously identified in a comprehensive request for corrections. If a county issues a comprehensive written or electronic request or a supplemental request for corrections, the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame are suspended from the date the request is issued until the date that the county receives the corrections from the applicant. If an applicant requests significant changes, alterations, additions or amendments to an application that are consistent with the purposes of the original application and that are not in response to a request for corrections and may have no more than an additional fifty per cent of the substantive review time frame as established by the county for that license to grant or deny the license, a county may make one additional comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections. Nothing shall prevent communication between a county and an applicant regarding a comprehensive written or electronic request for corrections or a supplemental request for corrections. A county may consider an application withdrawn if, by thirty days or longer after the date of notice, as established by the county, the applicant does not supply the documentation or information requested or an explanation of why the information cannot be provided within the established time period.

H. Nothing shall prevent the county from continuing to process the application during the suspension of the substantive review time frame and overall time frame.

I. By mutual written or electronic agreement, a county and an applicant for a license may extend the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame. An extension of the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame may not exceed fifty per cent of the overall time frame.

J. Unless a county and an applicant for a license mutually agree to extend the substantive review time frame and the overall time frame pursuant to subsection I of this section, a county shall issue a written or electronic notice granting or denying a license to an applicant.  If a county denies or withdraws an application for a license, the county shall include in the written or electronic notice at least the following information:

1. Justification for the denial or withdrawal with references to the statutes, ordinances, regulations, substantive policy statements or delegation agreements on which the denial or withdrawal is based.

2. An explanation of the applicant's right to appeal the denial or withdrawal. The explanation shall include the number of working days in which the applicant must file a protest challenging the denial or withdrawal and the name and telephone number of a county contact person who can answer questions regarding the appeals process.

3. An explanation of the applicant's right to resubmit the application, the total amount of fees that will be assessed if the applicant resubmits the application and the method in which those fees were calculated.

K. If a county does not issue to the applicant the written or electronic notice granting or denying a license within the overall time frame or within the mutually agreed on time frame extension, the county shall refund to the applicant all fees charged for reviewing and acting on the application for the license and shall excuse payment of any fees that have not yet been paid.  The county shall not require an applicant to submit an application for a refund pursuant to this subsection.  The refund shall be made within thirty working days after the expiration of the overall time frame or the time frame extension. The county shall continue to process the application.  Notwithstanding any other statute, the county shall make the refund from the fund in which the application fees were originally deposited. The right to receive a refund of fees charged for reviewing and acting on the application for the license may not be waived by the applicant.

L. If an application for a license is denied because revisions or corrections were not submitted or considered within the allowed time frame, or withdrawn, and the applicant resubmits the application for the same purposes with only revisions or corrections to the original application, the county shall not assess any additional fees that exceed fifty per cent of the original application fees that have not been refunded to the applicant provided that the application is submitted before the time of destruction of the original application file pursuant to section 41-151.15. This subsection does not apply to license applications that were denied for disqualifying criminal convictions or that were submitted fraudulently.

M. This section does not apply to a license that is either:

1. Issued within seven working days after receipt of the initial application or a permit that expires within twenty-one working days after issuance.

2. Necessary for the construction or development of a residential lot, including swimming pools, hardscape and property walls, subdivisions or master planned community.

1. "Master planned community" means development by one or more developers of real estate that consists of residential, commercial, education, health care, open space and recreational components and that is developed pursuant to a long-range, multiphase master plan providing comprehensive land use planning and staged implementation and development.

### Article 4 - Counties

#### Section 11-1941. Management of highways; counties; permits or licenses

A. In managing a highway under local laws described in section 11-1911, subsection C, paragraph 9, a county may manage the use of the highway including all of the following:

1. Requiring a video service provider that is constructing, installing, working within, maintaining or repairing facilities in, on, under or over any highway to obtain a construction, encroachment or occupancy permit for the work.

2. Inspecting the construction, installation, maintenance or repair work performed on such facilities.

3. Limiting installation of new aerial facilities.

B. If a video service provider requests a permit or inspection, the county shall grant or deny the request within the time frame that the county has in place under section 11-1605.

C. If emergency response work or repair becomes necessary in, on, under or over any highway, a video service provider may begin that work or repair without prior approval from a county if the video service provider notifies the county as promptly as reasonably possible after learning that the work or repair is necessary.

#### Section 11-1942. Fees and charges; emergency alert; damage; undergrounding; wireless facilities; definition

A. Except the license fee on gross revenue authorized by section 11-1943 and excise taxes as provided in subsection B of this section, a county may not levy a tax, rent, fee or charge, however denominated, on a video service provider for the use of the highways to provide video service or levy a tax, fee or charge on the privilege of engaging in the business of providing video service in the service area. Taxes, rents, fees and charges include all of the following:

1. Access channel support except for in-kind services, goods or payments as provided in subsection C of this section.

2. Rental, application, construction, permit, inspection, inconvenience and other fees and charges related to a video service provider's use or occupancy of the highways, including the use authorized by subsection D of this section except that a county may impose on a video service provider some or all of the fees and charges described in this paragraph. A video service provider shall offset the fees and charges imposed pursuant to this paragraph against the next license fee payment made pursuant to section 11-1943.

B. Any excise taxes otherwise authorized by local law to be levied on the business of providing video service or in relation to use of the highways to provide video service may be levied on a video service provider if the taxes are levied only on gross revenue and the rate of the taxes is subject to this subsection.  This subsection does not authorize the imposition of excise taxes on interstate telecommunications service. The license fee and any excise taxes levied on gross revenue constitute a franchise fee within the meaning of the term in 47 United States Code section 542(g). The total of the rates of the license fee and of any excise taxes on gross revenue levied or assessed by a county for the privilege of providing video service and related use of the highways to provide video service may not exceed a rate of five percent.

C. Subsection A of this section does not prohibit a county from levying fees and charges on a video service provider or its affiliates pursuant to section 9-584 or chapter 13, article 1 of this title without an offset against license fees.

D. A county may not require a video service provider to provide in-kind goods or services, make in-kind payments, assessments or obligations or pay a fee in addition to the monetary license fee levied or assessed as provided in section 11-1943, except for any of the following:

1. A local law may impose and enforce obligations equally and uniformly on all video service providers that are operating within the boundaries of a county and on all holdover cable operators that hold a local license that remains in effect under section 11-1914, subsection A. Under the local law, a county:

(a) May require all video service providers to provide channel capacity for the video service provider to transmit programming over which the video service provider exercises no editorial control except as authorized by 47 United States Code section 531(e).  The channel capacity shall be limited to one of the following:

(i) Not more than two channels of public, educational or governmental access programming in the basic service tier of the video service network and not more than two channels of noncommercial governmental programming, at least one of which may be programmed by the federal government, in the digital programming tier of the video service network.

(ii) Not more than two lines of access programming with each line of programming carried on up to two standard definition channels and two switched digital high-definition channels.

(b) Shall specify the programming and the video service provider may require that the channels regularly display an unobtrusive logo or other suitable identifier of the video service provider, if the county requires channel capacity pursuant to subdivision (a) of this paragraph.

(c) May require all video service providers to incur costs and expenses to provide, maintain and operate facilities and equipment of the video service network, including facilities and equipment for signal carriage, processing, reformatting and interconnection for all of the following:

(i) To connect the video service network or cable system, as it may be relocated from time to time, to transmit programming to and from existing locations of public, educational or governmental access facilities and to allow monitoring of access programming at the facilities.

(ii) To transmit public, educational and governmental access channels to subscribers with the same prevailing quality, functionality and identification as other channels.

(d) May require all video service providers and incumbent cable operators to provide at no initial or recurring charge the basic service tier of video service to one outlet and one receiving device at each building occupied by the county if the building is not more than two hundred feet from the nearest technically and commercially feasible point of connection on the video service network.

2. A county may retain nonreceiving equipment that it owns without charge for the equipment's use and at the county's expense, including equipment previously provided by an incumbent cable operator.

E. A local law may not impose any obligation on a video service provider under subsection D of this section that is more burdensome than the least burdensome requirement under any local license with a service area within the boundaries of the county that was in effect on February 1, 2019.

F. None of the annual fair market value of any channel capacity provided pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 1, subdivision (a), the annual costs and expenses incurred pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 1, subdivision (c) and the annual fair market value of basic service and line extension provided pursuant to subsection D, paragraph 1, subdivision (d) may be offset against the license fee levied or assessed under this section.

G. Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, by a nondiscriminatory local law that imposes and enforces the obligations equally and uniformly on all video service providers operating within the boundaries of a county, a county may require that a video service provider bear all of the reasonable costs that are associated with repair and restoration of damage caused to private property or highways by the repair, replacement, installation, construction, maintenance or operation of the video service provider's facilities in the highways and that are imposed on a competitively neutral and nondiscriminatory basis in relation to costs borne by telecommunications corporations under section 9-582, subsection C.

H. On application, a county shall issue to a video service provider or its affiliate a permit to attach allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment to the video service network in the highways within the boundaries of the county. The permit shall allow installation, operation and maintenance of allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment.  A county may require that all of the allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment at a single location fit within a fifteen-inch cube and be contained entirely within a ground-mounted pedestal or be connected directly to and mounted at the same height as one of the video service provider's aerial horizontal conductors. This subsection does not do any of the following:

1. Prohibit a county from requiring a video service provider to place underground aerial facilities to which allowed Wi-Fi equipment is attached.

2. Prohibit the imposition of a tax, rent, fee or charge on revenue from services provided through allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment.

3. Affect the authority of a county to manage the highways within its boundaries or to exercise its police powers, including review and approval of an application before issuing a permit.

4. Affect any authority of a political subdivision, including an agricultural improvement district or any other special taxing district, the county or any other person controlling utility poles in the highways to deny, limit, restrict or determine the terms and conditions for the use of or attachment to the utility poles or attachments to other poles of the political subdivision, county or other person by a video service provider.

I. This section does not prohibit a video service provider from agreeing with a county to provide in-kind services or goods or make in-kind payments in the service area that are otherwise prohibited by this section if the agreement with the county is not entered into as a condition of operating in the service area under a uniform video service license issued pursuant to this chapter.  The agreement may authorize the video service provider to retain license fees and taxes collected from its subscribers in the amount of any offset to license fees specified in the agreement.

J. For the purposes of this section, "allowed Wi-Fi radio equipment" means radio equipment that uses only unlicensed radio spectrum and that enables wireless communication with a communications network for unlicensed services such as Wi-Fi service.

#### Section 11-1943. License fee; requirements; conditions and limitations; pass through to subscribers

A. For the privilege of a video service provider to occupy or use, in whole or in part, any highway within the boundaries of a county to provide video service through a video service network, the county may require a video service provider to pay a license fee to the county based on the gross revenue that the video service provider receives from its subscribers located within the boundaries of the county.  The license fee both:

1. Is subject to the limit prescribed by section 11-1942, subsection B and to offset, including amounts collected from subscribers, as prescribed by section 11-1942, subsections A and I and subsection D of this section.

2. Shall be due no more often than quarterly.

B. If the county requires a license fee pursuant to subsection A of this section, the county shall adopt a local law that imposes the license fee equally and uniformly on all of the following that are operating within the boundaries of the county:

1. Video service providers.

2. Holdover cable operators.

C. A video service provider shall pay the entire amount of the license fee directly to the county in a check, draft or note or automated clearinghouse transaction that is payable in legal tender as defined in section 43-1021.

D. A video service provider may do all of the following:

1. Pass the license fee through to and collect the license fee from its subscribers within the boundaries of the county, including for an incumbent cable operator any change in license fees that results from a change in the applicable definition of gross revenue.

2. Designate the amount of the license fee collected from each subscriber as a separate line item on the subscriber's bill.

#### Section 11-1944. Ownership of a video service network

Except for the purposes of acting as an intermediary in a transfer of a uniform video service license, a county may not own a video service network.

#### Section 11-1945. Review and audit; bundling discounts; action to recover underpayment or overpayment

A. Not more than once every three years, a county, on reasonable written notice, may audit the business books and records of a video service provider to the extent necessary to ensure payment of license fees pursuant to this chapter.  The county may not audit any period that ends more than three years before the date that the notice of audit is received. Any audit of a period of time before issuance of a uniform video service license shall be conducted pursuant to the local laws in effect during the period of time.

B. Except as otherwise provided by federal law, if a video service provider offers video service bundled with other services that are not video service for a single discounted price, all of the following apply:

1. The method that the video service provider uses to determine gross revenue subject to license fees by allocating the single discounted price among the bundle of video service and nonvideo services shall be reasonable and supported by the video service provider's books and records.

2. The county shall accept as reasonable, for purposes of meeting the video service provider's burden of proof, an allocation based on an objective and verifiable method using the books and records that the video service provider kept in the regular course of business for other purposes, including nontax purposes.

3. A video service provider may not use bundled offerings as a means to evade paying license fees.

C. The county and the video service provider shall each pay its own costs and fees relating to each audit performed pursuant to subsection A of this section.  If the sum determined to be underpaid exceeds five percent of the total fees that the audit determines should have been paid for the period, the video service provider shall pay the county's reasonable costs of the audit.

D. The rate of interest for both underpayments and overpayments is the federal short-term rate, determined pursuant to 26 United States Code section 6621(b), plus three percentage points.

E. A person that performs a review and audit under subsection A of this section may not receive compensation that is based, in whole or in part, on either of the following:

1. Finding a particular result.

2. The amount of any underpayment or overpayment of the license fee that is identified because of the review and audit.

F. A complaint by a county for underpayment of a license fee from a video service provider or by a video service provider for overpayment of a license fee to a county shall be made pursuant to article 5 of this chapter.

G. A complaint for a violation of the license fee obligations under this chapter may not be made unless a written demand by a county for payment of the license fees or a written demand by a video service provider for refund of license fees is made within four months after the county or video service provider realizes it has been damaged or knows or reasonably should know of the damage caused by the alleged violation.

H. A complaint must be filed pursuant to article 5 of this chapter within two years after the written demand is made pursuant to subsection G of this section but not sooner than four months after the written demand.
