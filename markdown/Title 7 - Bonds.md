# Title 7 - Bonds

## Chapter 1 - SURETY BONDS

### Article 1 - General Provisions

#### Section 7-101. Execution of bond; sureties

When a bond or undertaking is required by law to be given for the faithful performance of a duty or obligation, or required to be given in a judicial proceeding in a court of this state, the bond shall, unless otherwise specified by the law requiring it, be executed by the principal and at least two sureties. The sureties shall be residents and freeholders or householders within this state and, unless acting as surety for state officers, of the county in which the bond is given. Each surety shall justify by affidavit stating that he is worth the amount specified in the bond over and above his just debts and liabilities, exclusive of property exempt from execution.

#### Section 7-102. Qualification of sureties

A bond shall not be approved if executed by individual sureties unless the sureties appear upon the tax roll of the county for an amount at least equal to the penalty of any other judicial bonds upon which they may already be sureties. If a surety is married, the bond shall be signed by both husband and wife.

#### Section 7-103. Corporate surety; power of attorney; fee

A. When a bond or undertaking conditioned upon the faithful performance of a duty, or upon doing or refraining from doing anything in the bond or undertaking specified, is by the laws of this state required or permitted to be given with surety, the execution or the guaranteeing of the performance of the condition shall be sufficient when executed or guaranteed solely by a corporation incorporated under the laws of the United States, or of any state, authorized to execute the bond or undertaking within this state, if the bond or undertaking is approved by the court, body or person required to approve or accept it. An officer or person having the power of approval of a bond shall not exact that it be furnished by a surety company or by a particular surety company.

B. The corporate surety shall file with the clerk of the superior court a power of attorney for each agent of such surety appointed to execute a bond in its behalf. A fee established pursuant to section 12-284 for each such filing shall be paid to the clerk of the superior court.

#### Section 7-104. Bonds payable to state

Any bond or undertaking given by a trustee, receiver, assignee or officer of a court in any action or proceeding for the faithful discharge of his duties, where it is not otherwise provided, shall be payable to the state, and upon leave of the court where the action or proceeding is pending, may be prosecuted for the benefit of any and all persons interested therein.

#### Section 7-105. Bail undertaking in a criminal action as lien

A. A bail undertaking in a criminal action, or after conviction of a defendant, or upon appeal therefrom shall be a lien on any real property described therein from the time of recording such undertaking in the office of the county recorder of the county in which the property is located.

B. Upon filing an order with the county recorder of the county where the property is located canceling the undertaking the lien shall be discharged.

#### Section 7-106. Deposit in lieu of bond

A. In a civil or criminal matter or proceeding when a bond is required of a party, he may, instead of giving the bond, deposit with the court lawful money of the United States in the sum required in the bond, which shall be accepted in lieu of the bond. If the party has given bond, he may, before its forfeiture, deposit the sum mentioned in the bond, whereupon the bond shall be exonerated. A party having deposited money in lieu of giving bond, may, before its forfeiture, withdraw the money upon the giving and approval of a sufficient bond.

B. When money has been deposited and remains on deposit at the time of judgment or disposition of the matter, and thereby has become liable to the satisfaction thereof, the money shall, under the direction of the court, be applied in the same manner and to the same extent as if it had been recovered upon a bond given for that purpose. Where an appeal is taken and money has been deposited in lieu of a bond, the deposit shall be disposed of in the same manner as if it were a bond filed in the proceeding.

#### Section 7-107. Sufficiency of bond; objection

In an action or proceeding in a state court, when a bond is required or permitted to be given, the adverse party may object to its sufficiency at any time within three days after receiving notice of giving the bond, by serving the adverse party, or the officer who takes the bond, with a written notice that he does not accept the bond. A failure to serve the notice shall be deemed an acceptance of the bond, and the officer taking it shall be exonerated from liability.

#### Section 7-108. Notice of justification

The party or officer receiving the notice provided for in section 7-107 shall, within three days, serve the opposite party with a notice in writing that the sureties on the bond, or other sureties will justify before an officer authorized to approve the bond, and the time and place when and where the sureties will justify.

#### Section 7-109. Sureties; examination on sufficiency; attorney of party ineligible as surety

Each of the sureties shall attend before the officer at the time and place mentioned in the notice provided for in sections 7-107 and 7-108 and may be examined on oath touching his sufficiency in such manner as the officer deems proper. If the officer finds the sureties sufficient he shall endorse his allowance on the bond and cause it to be filed with the clerk or justice. No bond shall be allowed or approved wherein any attorney of record of either party to the action or proceeding is a surety.

#### Section 7-110. Joint control of assets secured by bond

A. Any party of whom a bond, undertaking or other obligation is required and his surety may make an agreement providing for the safekeeping of any monies or assets for which he and his surety are or may be responsible by depositing them with a bank, savings bank, safe-deposit or trust company authorized by law to do business as such or with any other depository approved by the court if the deposit is otherwise proper. The agreement may provide that the withdrawal of the monies or assets or any part thereof may be made only with the written consent of the surety or upon order of court made on such notice to the surety as the court may direct.

B. The agreement authorized by subsection A shall not in any manner release from or change the liability of the principal or surety as established by the terms of the bond.

### Article 2 - Injunction, Attachment or Garnishment Bond

#### Section 7-121. Irresponsible surety; procedure

In all actions or proceedings in which an injunction, attachment or garnishment bond is executed, the defendant may at any time present to the court a statement in writing, under the oath of the defendant or his agent or attorney, that the sureties or a surety on the bond was at the time of becoming a surety, not responsible as such surety, or has become irresponsible since the execution of the bond. Thereupon the court shall cause a notice of the statement to be served upon the plaintiff, and shall cite the plaintiff to appear and show cause within five days after the service of notice why the plaintiff should not be required to execute a new and sufficient bond.

#### Section 7-122. Hearing on sufficiency

The court shall summarily hear the issue upon the sufficiency of the bond, and if the court finds the sureties or any thereof to be insufficient, the injunction, attachment or garnishment shall be dissolved, unless the plaintiff shall within five days file a proper and sufficient bond and it is approved by the court or judge.
